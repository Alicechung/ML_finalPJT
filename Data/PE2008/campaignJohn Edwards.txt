Remarks at the DNC Winter Meeting in Washington, DC

February 2, 2007

Thank you.
We're all here together вЂ“ but why are we here?
Why are we here?
We are here because somewhere in America an eight-year old girl goes to sleep hungry, a little girl who ought to be drawing pictures and learning multiplication cries herself to sleep, praying that her father, who has been out of work for two years, will get a job again. It doesn't have to be that way.
We are here because somewhere in America, a hotel housekeeper walks a picket line with her union brothers and sisters fighting for decent health care benefits during the day and works the late-shift at a diner at night so that she and her family can live a decent life and so her boy can go to college and have choices she never had. And somewhere a young man folds a college acceptance letter and puts it in his drawer because even with his part-time job and his mother's second job, he knows he cannot afford to go. It doesn't have to be that way.
We are here because somewhere in America a mother wipes her hand on a dishcloth to go answer a knock on her door вЂ¦ and opens it to find an army chaplain and an officer standing there with solemn faces and her boy's name вЂ“ her patriotic son who enlisted after September 11 вЂ“ on their lips. It doesn't have to be that way.
We are here because somewhere in the world, a 5-year old boy in a refugee camp is bending under the weight of his 2-year old sister. His family massacred, he carries his remaining sister everywhere, and sleeps with his arms wrapped tightly around her, knowing that tomorrow he will have to do the same thing, and again the next day and the day after that because she is all the family he has now. It doesn't have to be that way.
We are here because somewhere in America a father comes home from the second shift and feels a raging fever on the brow of his sleeping daughter as he kisses her goodnight. And now, bone-weary and worried, he cradles that child in his arms at the emergency room, because there is nowhere else for him to go. It doesn't have to be that way.
They are why we are here. Because everywhere in America, people are counting on us to stand up for them.
And so I ask you, will you stand up for that tired father forced into emergency rooms to get health care for his little girl?
Will you stand up for the brave young boy in the refugee camp?
Will you stand up for the working men and women in our labor movement who have to fight for decent working conditions and living wages?
Will you stand up for the young man who knows that education is his way out of the cycle of poverty and yet it seems beyond his grasp?
Will you stand up for that hungry eight-year old girl so she doesn't give up on her life before it's even begun?
Will you stand up for all the American families whose loved ones are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan?
Will you stand up?
Will you stand up for America?
Because if we don't stand up, who will?
If we don't speak out, who will?
Forty years ago, speaking in protest against the war in Vietnam on the eve of its escalation, the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King said there comes a time when silence is betrayal. Silence is betrayal.
That time has come again. We cannot stand silent.
They have to hear you. Can they hear you?
I believe it is a betrayal not to speak out against the escalation of the war our nation is engaged in today, in Iraq.
It is a betrayal for this President to send more troops into harm's way when we know it will not succeed in bringing stability to the region.
And it is not right by our silence to enable this President to escalate the war in Iraq. And we must not delude ourselves: our silence enables this President to escalate the war.
It is a betrayal not to stop the President's plan when we have the responsibility, the power and the actual tools to prevent it.
Being satisfied with non-binding resolutions we know this President will ignore is a betrayal. And shutting down debate in the Senate on this issue is worse than a betrayal. It's an outright denial of the people's will.
And one more thing, while I'm at it.
You described yourself as "the decider." I have news for you. The American people are the real "deciders," Mr. President. And they are saying, "You have had your chance."
Americans are speaking out. And our leaders must do no less.
You must stand up now against George Bush's escalation of the war in Iraq. George Bush is counting on us not to stand up, not to fight against this escalation with everything we have. George Bush is counting on a Democratic Party that will not press for what we know is right.
Silence is betrayal.
Opposing this escalation with all the vigor and tools we have is a test of our political courage. And you'd better believe that George Bush, Dick Cheney and Karl Rove are betting that we don't have that courage.
They don't think we have it in us. They're counting on their opponents to be weak, and political, and careful.
This is not the time for political calculation. This is the time for political courage. Stand up.
Being honest and changing course in Iraq is the first step in restoring America's ability to provide moral leadership throughout the world. And make no mistake: America must lead. We are the pre-eminent, stabilizing power in the world. If we don't stand up, who will?
This is the time for political courage вЂ“ not only when it comes to speaking out against Iraq, but also about the challenges we face here at home.
Because, when it comes to 37 million Americans living in poverty, silence is betrayal.
One in every five children вЂ“ count them, one in every five American children вЂ“ live in poverty, here on the richest nation on the planet. It doesn't have to be that way.
The causes of poverty are complex, entrenched, and powerful. And our will to address them and restore the promises of equality and social justice must be just as strong. Are you strong enough? Will you stand up to end poverty in America? It means addressing education, jobs, health care, housing, predatory lending, and personal responsibility. The fight will be long and it will not be easy. Are you ready? Will you use your voice against poverty, or will you stand silent? Stand up. Stand up to eradicate poverty in America.
When it comes to 47 million Americans without health care, silence is betrayal.
The 47 million are silent victims of a health care system gone wrong, where policies are driven by profits not patient care. We have to stop letting the health insurance companies and the big pharmaceutical concerns decide our nation's health care policy. We have to give the silent victims, who stand in line at free clinics and use the expired medicines of friends and neighbors, we have to give them the dignity of universal health care.
And while we're at it, we have to stop using words like вЂњaccess to health careвЂќ when we know with certainty those words mean something less than universal care. Who are you willing to leave behind without the care he needs? Which family? Which child?
We need a truly universal solution, and we need it now.
Will you stand up for universal health insurance in America?
And it's time we stood up for an energy policy that's not dictated by the profit margins of Big Oil -- and an environmental policy that's not promoted by or regulated by polluters. Today, not tomorrow, or in the next decade or in the next generation. Today, our planet is at risk, and here, again, silence is betrayal.
So, will you speak out? Will you stand up?
These are the great moral imperatives of our time. And by breaking the silence we are not breaking faith with our flag or our forefathers or our brave young men and women in uniform. We are keeping faith with America.
Because we are better than this. We are better than this.
We should be the bright light, the beacon for all the world.
We are not the country of the Superdome in New Orleans after Katrina;
We are not the country of Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo;
We are not the country of secret surveillance and government behind closed doors.
We are Americans, and we're better than that.
And we are Democrats, the party of action вЂ“ not reaction. We are Democrats, the party of principle вЂ“ not appeasement. The time for half-measures, empty promises, and sweet rhetoric is gone. Now is the time for courage, decisiveness and moral leadership.
It's time to stand up for the promise of America again -- and for the principle that every American matters, no matter where you come from, or what color your skin is, or how much money you have in your pocket.
Let's stand up for the working people whose labor made this country great. America was built by men and women who worked with their hands. And organized labor has fought for and made better the lives of every working man and woman, by giving them a voice вЂ“ labor never stands silent where wrongs need to be righted. Will you stand with them? It is time we acknowledged that it is organized labor, which has protected the American worker against mistreatment by corporate America. I am proud to stand beside organized labor? Will you stand with them, too? Will you walk with them and march with them?
We know one thing for sure: it is time to be patriotic about something other than war. It is time to do what you know is right and to speak out against what you know is wrong.
Not tomorrow. Now. Speak out now, take action now.
We don't have to wait to see if someone keeps the promises of a 2008 campaign. In fact, the transformational change this country needs cannot wait until January 2009.
Tomorrow begins today. And our obligation to act starts right here, right now.
Because somewhere in America, because everywhere in America, people are counting on us to stand by them and to fight alongside them for what we know in our hearts is right.
So let's stand up together. We have always been the party of promise who stood with the working man and woman, the party of hope who stood with the needy, the party of compassion who stood with the young and the old and the frail. It is who we are.
In times like these, we don't need to redefine the Democratic Party; we need to reclaim the Democratic Party.
Thank you, God bless you and God bless this great country.

Interview with Tim Russert on NBC News' "Meet the Press"

February 4, 2007

RUSSERT: Senator Edwards, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
EDWARDS: Thank you for having me, Tim.
RUSSERT: A few weeks ago, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts was on this program, and he said that, in his entire career in the United States Senate, spanning 40 years, the vote he cast on the war in–on–in Iraq was the most important. Do agree with it was the most important vote you cast?
EDWARDS: Yes.
RUSSERT: And, in your mind, you got it wrong.
EDWARDS: I did.
RUSSERT: I'm going to go back to October of 2002, that critical week when the Senate was debating the war and you gave a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
EDWARDS: Yes, sir.
RUSSERT: Let's watch it and come back and talk about it.
(Videotape, October 7, 2002)
EDWARDS: My position is very clear. The time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. I'm a co-sponsor of the bipartisan resolution that is presently under consideration in the Senate. Saddam Hussein's regime is a grave threat to America and our allies. We know that he has chemical and biological weapons today, that he's used them in the past, and that he's doing everything he can to build more. Every day he gets closer to his long-term goal of nuclear capability.
(End videotape)
RUSSERT: " A grave threat to America," do you still believe that?
EDWARDS: No.
RUSSERT: Why were you so wrong?
EDWARDS: For the same reason a lot of people were wrong. You know, we–the intelligence information that we got was wrong. I mean, tragically wrong. On top of that I'd–beyond that, I went back to former Clinton administration officials who gave me sort of independent information about what they believed about what was happening with Saddam's weapon–weapons programs. They were also wrong. And, based on that, I made the wrong judgment. I, I, I want to go another step, though, because I think this is more than just weapons of mass destruction. I mean, I–at the–I remember vividly what I was thinking about at the time. It was, first, I was convinced he had weapons of mass destruction. That's turned out to be completely wrong and false. I had internal conflict because I was worried about what George Bush would do. I didn't have–I didn't have confidence about him doing the work that needed to be done with the international community, the lead-up to a potential invasion in Iraq. I didn't know, in fairness, that he would be as incompetent as he's been in the administration of the war. But I had–there were at least two things going on. It wasn't just the weapons of mass destruction I was wrong about. It's become absolutely clear–and I'm very critical of myself for this–become absolutely clear, looking back, that I should not have given this president this authority.
RUSSERT: At that time, however, Senator Kennedy's saying, " This is not an imminent threat." General Zinni, who led the military in that region, said this is the wrong war.
EDWARDS: Mm-hmm.
RUSSERT: General Scowcroft, former President Bush's national security advisor. And the National Intelligence Estimate that was given to you and now made public had some real caveats, and this is one of them. " The activities we have detected do not ... add up to a compelling case that Iraq is currently pursuing what INR [the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research] would consider to be an integrated and comprehensive approach to acquire nuclear weapons." Do you remember seeing that?
EDWARDS: Mm-hmm, I did see it. I mean, I, I think it was–there were serious questions about whether–again, we're looking back. Now we know none of this was true. But, at the time, there were serious questions about any effort to obtain nuclear weapons, which is what that statement just was. All of us believed there was no question that he had chemical and biological weapons, and there was at least some scattered evidence that he was making an effort to get nuclear weapons.
RUSSERT: But it seems as if, as a member of the intelligence committee, you just got it dead wrong, and that you even ignored some caveats and ignored people who were urging caution.
EDWARDS: Well, I, I, I would–first of all, I don't want to defend this. Let me be really clear about this. I think anybody who wants to be president of the United States has got to be honest and open, be willing to admit when they've done things wrong. One of the things, unfortunately, that's happened in Iraq is we've had a president who was completely unmoving, wouldn't change course, wouldn't take any responsibility or admit that he'd made any mistakes. And I think America, in fact the world has paid a huge price for that. So I accept my responsibility. I'm not defending what I did. Because what happened was the information that we got on the intelligence committee was, was relatively consistent with what I was getting from former Clinton administration officials. I told you a few minutes ago I was concerned about giving this president the authority, and I turned out to be wrong about that.
RUSSERT: In that same speech I showed earlier, you seemed to embrace, however, a–the Bush vision of what could happen in Iraq. And let's just watch that and come back and talk about it.
EDWARDS: Sure.
(Videotape, October 7, 2002)
EDWARDS: Democracy will not spring up by itself overnight in a multiethnic, complicated society that's suffered under one repressive regime after another for generations. The Iraqi people deserve and need our help to rebuild their lives and to create a prosperous, thriving, open society. All Iraqis, including Sunnis, Shia and Kurds, deserve to be represented. This is not just a moral imperative. It's a security imperative. It is in America's national interest to help build an Iraq at peace with itself and its neighbors, because a democratic, tolerant and accountable Iraq will be a peaceful regional partner, and such an Iraq could serve as a model for the entire Arab world.
(End videotape)
RUSSERT: Do you think that was naive?
EDWARDS: No, I think that had, had Saddam, who's–had the war in Iraq been executed the way that it should have been executed, I think there would be a much greater likelihood of there being a democratic Iraq. I think we would still see at least some symptoms of what we're seeing raging on the ground in Iraq right now. But no, I think there was some potential for a democracy in Iraq.
RUSSERT: Many have suggested, included some of the candidates Friday at the Democratic National Committee, that the reason so many Democrats voted for giving the president authority in October of 2002 was a political calculation. They were afraid of the midterm elections of 2002. Do you think that's fair?
EDWARDS: It's a–it's a completely fair question. If I–if I were watching a, a politician under those circumstances, I'd be very cynical about what their motives are, and why, why they did what they did. I can only tell you, in my case, I came to the conclusion, turned out to be wrong, that the president should be given this authority.
I do think it's important–again, not defensively–but important to point out that I didn't run the war and neither did the other people in Congress who voted for the war. The president's the one who made this extraordinary mess. I mean, it's been mistake after mistake after mistake. But I did cast this vote, and I'm the person responsible for this vote, no one else.
RUSSERT: Let me bring you back to October 10th of 2004. You were running for vice president, a few weeks before the election...
EDWARDS: Yes.
RUSSERT: ...you were on this program. The war...
EDWARDS: I remember.
RUSSERT: The war is now a year and a half old, and I asked you about your vote. Let's watch.
EDWARDS: Sure.
(Videotape, October 10, 2004)
RUSSERT: If you knew today, and you do know, there is–there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, would you still vote to go to war with Iraq?
EDWARDS: I would have voted for the resolution, knowing what I know today, because it was the right thing to do to give the president the authority to confront Saddam Hussein.
I think Saddam Hussein was a very serious threat. I stand by that, and that's why we stand behind our vote on the resolution.
(End of videotape)
RUSSERT: That's a year and a half into the war.
EDWARDS: Mm-hmm. Perfect–that's a very fair question. I can tell you what happened with me, personally. We got through–I was–at that point, I was in the middle of a very intense campaign, one that I thought was very important for America. When the campaign was over and the election was over, we had a lot going on in my own family. Elizabeth had been diagnosed with breast cancer, we were taking care of her. And for the first time I had time to really think about, number one, what I was going to spend my time doing, and, number two, my vote for this war. And over time, when I reflected on what I thought was going to be necessary going forward, to have some moral foundation to work on issues like poverty and genocide, things that I care deeply about, I could no longer defend this vote. It was pretty simple. And I got to the place I felt like I had to say it and had to say it publicly. And so–what?--a year–a year or so ago I did that.
RUSSERT: But if you look back and people say, well, the midterm elections of 2002, the Democrats did not have the courage to stand up to President Bush and voted for the war, weeks before the mid–the presidential election of 2004, you're running for vice president of the United States, a chance to say something about the war. Instead you said, 'My vote was correct, Saddam was a threat.'
EDWARDS: But in–but in fairness we were very critical about the war at that point, during the 2004 campaign, very critical about the war, very critical of what was happening with the war, the impact that the war had had on America's moral standing in the world. But, you know, my, my vote was wrong, and I, I–and I take responsibility for it.
RUSSERT: And you said that in November of '05 publicly, an op-ed piece in The Washington Post.
EDWARDS: I did. I did.
RUSSERT: Last Wednesday you gave an interview to The Politico, and you said this: " 'When we went to war, Senator Clinton and I both voted for it. ...' Edwards [said]. 'I have since said I was wrong, and I take responsibility for that. I have not heard Senator Clinton say that.' Should she say she was wrong? [Edwards was] asked. 'That is a moral decision she has to make,' Edwards said." Do you believe Senator Clinton is morally bound to admit the war was wrong?
EDWARDS: I think she's morally bound to follow her own conscience. If she–if she believes–and this doesn't just apply to her, it applies to anybody in the Congress–if she believes that her vote was wrong, then yes, she should say so. If she believes that her vote was right, then she should defend it.
RUSSERT: Can you be the Democratic candidate for president without saying the war was wrong?
EDWARDS: Yes, of course you can, if, if that's what you truly believe, and that's what your heart and conscience state.
RUSSERT: You talked about silence is betrayal, and you're urging your other candidates to step forward and clearly enunciate their views on the war in Iraq. The Clinton campaign responded this way: " 'In 2004, John Edwards used to constantly brag about running a positive campaign. Today, he has unfortunately chosen to open his campaign with political attacks on Democrats who are fighting the Bush administration's Iraq policy,' said Clinton adviser Howard Wolfson."
EDWARDS: We are at a critical time in American history. The last thing we should be worried about is how politicians react and how their feelings are hurt. What we ought to be focused on is what needs to be done about this moral issue about the war. It's stopping George Bush from escalating this war. And I think all of us have a personal responsibility, if we believe, for example–that's–and that's what the subject was that you were talking about–if we believe that it is morally wrong to escalate this war, and it is strategically wrong to escalate war. What I have said is it is not enough to give speeches, to talk to political pundits, to pass nonbinding resolutions. We have to step to the plate and show some courage and do what's right on behalf of these men and women who are serving in Iraq and on behalf of that–people in that region of the world. The country and the world is owed that from us. It's at such a critical point in America's history that we have to stand up and show some backbone.
RUSSERT: If you were in the Senate, would you vote to cut off funding for the war?
EDWARDS: Well, first of all, I'm not running for the Senate, I'm running for president of the United States. What I would do is, is say we're not going to fund an escalation of this war. That's what I think we should do. I would not cut off funding for the men and women who are part of our troops and serving in, in, in Iraq. Now, we know that a significant number–in fact, I think most of the troops who are part of the surge–and by the way, there was a disturbing report in the last couple of days that, you know, 20,000-plus troops may turn into 40,000 troops, because there's 20,000-plus combat troops who will have to be supported. I think that's–will be very surprising to most of America who heard the president speak about this. But we know most of them are already there, and what's actually going to happen is, in Anbar province where the Marines are, around Baghdad where the Army is, their deployments are going to be extended. And these are men and women who are already on their second, third–many of them–their second and third deployment. They deserve to come home. Their families deserve for them to come home.
And what I'm saying is that the men and women in Congress who have a vote, and those of us who have a, a platform to talk about this nationally, we have a responsibility to those men and women. And I, I actually believe that what the president and Cheney are counting on is that what we'll do is we'll talk about it, we'll complain about it, we'll talk about how bad the escalation is, but, at the end of the day, we'll go along. We cannot go along. We cannot enable this president to make another in a–in a terrible series of bad mistakes.
RUSSERT: So stop funding for the monies that would be paying for the surge?
EDWARDS: That would pay for the escalation, that's correct.
RUSSERT: Another opponent in the Democratic race for the presidency is Barack Obama of Illinois. In October of 2002, he was a state senator in the Illinois legislature. He came out against the war, and I want to share his words with you and our viewers. " I know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighbors, that the Iraqi economy is in shambles, that the Iraqi military is a fraction of its former strength, and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until, in the way of all petty dictators, he falls away into the dustbin of history.
" I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences. I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda. I am not opposed to all wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars." His judgment was on the money.
EDWARDS: Yeah, he–he's correct. Now, I will say, he wasn't burdened, like a lot of us with the information that we were receiving on the Intelligence Committee. And as members of the United States Senate, we were getting very intimate, detailed information about what was actually happening in Iraq. Senator Obama, I think, you–what'd you say?--was a state senator at the time. So he obviously wasn't, wasn't in the Congress and wasn't part of the–of the decision making. But a lot of those predictions turned out to be true.
RUSSERT: But why shouldn't voters in Democratic primaries say, 'On the big issue of the war, Obama was right, Edwards was wrong'?
EDWARDS: I was wrong. They should say that. And the question becomes,
'Who's best suited to be president of the United States? Who has the depth, the maturity, the judgment to be president of the United States?' And what I would say to anybody is I take full responsibility for what I did, I should be held accountable for that, but I do think it matters when you're willing to be open and honest with voters about what you've done. I think it's really important that the next president of the United States–and I'm not criticizing anybody, certainly not Senator Obama. But I think it's really important that the next president of the United Sates be a good, decent, honorable human being who's open and honest with the country because that is the only way we're going to re-establish trust between the American people and the president. And I also think it's going to be really important to re-establishing trust between America and the world, because the president is, in effect, the personification of America. And when the president, what I believe–one of the things I do believe the president needs to do is, in the first 100 days, travel the world, not just meet with leaders, but speak to the people of the world the way great American presidents have in the past. The famous John Kennedy " I am a Berliner" speech is an example. And for that to work and for us to spread a message that America doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity, different cultures, different faith beliefs–it's the heart of who we are–that spokesperson is going to have to be somebody that the rest of the world looks up to and respects.
RUSSERT: Do you believe that Senator Clinton has been open and honest about her support of the war in Iraq?
EDWARDS: I don't know the answer to that question, honestly. I, I can't–I can't–I don't know what's inside her, her head and her heart about this. I can't tell whether there are political calculations going on. I just don't know. But I think, as we go, that's what campaigns are about. I have a high opinion of Senator Clinton. She's done a remarkable job as a U.S. senator, but being president of the United States is a different test. And I think, through the course of this campaign, all of us, not just me or Senator Clinton or Senator Obama, but all the Democratic candidates and all the Republican candidates are going to be scrutinized for whether they have the character to be president of the United States. And they should be.
RUSSERT: You mentioned the vote in the Senate, and this is what you said about it. " That nonbinding resolution against Iraq troop surge favored by Barack Obama? 'Useless,' said Edwards. 'Exactly like a child standing in the corner and stomping his feet.'"
EDWARDS: True.
RUSSERT: So the Democrats shouldn't vote for the resolution against the president's surge.
EDWARDS: Oh no, it's fine to vote for the resolution, but the–complaining at this historic moment in American history is not enough. I mean, we won the election. We're now in charge of the House and the Senate. We have–we have the power to actually do something about this escalation. I totally understand that there are political consequences from, from showing that strength and courage. But I think it's necessary. I think it's what America needs from us.
RUSSERT: But if Democrats voted to cut off funding for the troops who are part of the surge, the accusation would be they're not supporting the men and women.
EDWARDS: But there's a very easy way to do this. In fact, I saw you questioning Senator Kennedy on the show about this. Senator Kennedy actually has a bill that, that–what it says is, in order–if it's passed into law–in order for more troops above the levels that are there now to be put into Iraq, the president would first have to come to Congress–and they use their funding authority as the basis for this–would have to come to Congress and get their permission. And I don't believe the Congress would give him that permission under the circumstances. So there–there's an easy, straightforward way to do this, but we, we have to have the strength to do it.
RUSSERT: Senator Joe Biden, another opponent in the Democratic race for the White House, had some things to say about your Iraq policy in the New York Observer. " 'I don't think John Edwards knows what the heck he's talking about,' Mr. Biden said, when asked about Mr. Edwards' advocacy of the immediate withdrawal of about 40,000 American troops from Iraq."
" John Edwards wants you and all the Democrats to think, 'I want us out of there,' but when you come back and say, 'OK, John, ... what about the chaos that will ensue? Do we have any interest, John, left in the region?' Well, John will have to answer yes or no. If he says yes, what are they? What are those interests, John? How do you protect those interests, John, if you are completely withdrawn? Are you withdrawn from the region, John? Are you withdrawn from Iraq, John? In what period? So all this stuff is like so much Fluffernutter out there. So for me, what I think you have to do is have a strategic notion. And they may have it - they are just smart enough not to enunciate it."
EDWARDS: Fluffernutter, huh?
RUSSERT: Did you ever have one?
EDWARDS: Oh, I, I think–I,I actually saw Senator Biden talking about this interview on television a few days ago. I think this is, unfortunately, I–part of the same interview where he criticized Senator Clinton also, and also talked about Senator Obama, which has gotten so much attention. I think he just–I think he had bad information. He misunderstood, based on what I heard him say, what I was saying that we should do in Iraq.
RUSSERT: But you are calling for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 troops.
EDWARDS: That I am, yes. What I think we–I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you.
RUSSERT: No, that's OK, excuse me, because, because that's an important point. The, the National Intelligence Estimate came out last week...
EDWARDS: Yes.
RUSSERT: ...which talked about the grave situation in Iraq, but it also addressed the issue of an immediate withdrawal of a sizable number of troops.
EDWARDS: Mm-hmm.
RUSSERT: And this is what the intelligence community said. " If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly ... we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.
" If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge that the [Iraqi Security Force] would be unlikely to survive as a nonsectarian national institution; neighboring countries ... might intervene openly in the conflict; massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable; [al-Qaeda in Iraq] would attempt to use parts of the country - particularly al-Anbar province - to plan increased attacks in and outside of Iraq." They're talking about your plan.
EDWARDS: Well, can we step back? I, I...
RUSSERT: Please.
EDWARDS: I'll respond to that specifically. If we can step back for a minute, because we really haven't talked about what I think, as president of the United States, we should do–if I were president today–what we should do in Iraq. I think everyone recognizes that what's happening on the ground in Iraq is a direct result of the Sunnis, the Baathists having been in, in power for a long period of time under Saddam, and now–as a minority–and now the Shia and the Maliki-led government are in charge, and they feel excluded. They think they're on the outside, which they largely are, legally and constitutionally. And that feeds the violence. It is the foundation for the violence. There are other contributors, which everyone recognizes. Certainly the foreign fighters, the terrorists, the Shia militia are all contributing to the ongoing violence. But the basic foundation for the violence is very clear, which is why I and others, the Baker group, determined that the only solution is not a military solution, but a political resolution, a political reconciliation. So the starting place for me in analyzing what we should be doing in Iraq, to create the–create the greatest chance for success–and I'll caveat what I'm about to say with what you just read and what is in the rest of that N.I.E. report from, from this week, which is the conditions are horrendous in Iraq. Not–and there–what's basically happened is there's a political track and there's a security track, and they're terrible on both fronts. So everyone recognizes this place could go chaotic no matter what you do, and I'd be the first to say that.
But the question is what do we do to try to get the Maliki, Shia-led government to bring the Sunni in, so as to have a buy-in to a long-term, stable government? What do we do to get the Sunni, disorganized as they are, leadership to try to contribute to a buy-in to the–to, to a political reconciliation? And the president's plan is we put 20,000-plus more troops into Iraq. I think all that does is enable the continued bad behavior, political bad behavior that we've seen over the last few years. What we need to do instead, in my judgment, is to shift this responsibility to them. It is the most likely way to create this political reconciliation.
Now, the argument by Senator McCain and others would be as long as the condition on the grounds–and that's what you–on the ground is as bad as it is–and that's what you just read from the N.I.E. report–is as bad as, as it is, political reconciliation is impossible. I think they've got it exactly backwards. I don't think there's any chance that these two groups are going to reach any kind of reconciliation until they feel imminent responsibility. We cannot continue to prop them up.
Now, I would add that I think it would be foolish for the president of the United States, if we go through this process–I mean, what I think the process should be is withdraw, as you pointed out, one piece of it, 40-, 50,000 troops now from the more secure areas of Iraq, continue to draw down American troops, combat troops over the course of the next 12-plus months, make it clear to the–to the leadership, both the Sunni and, and Maliki and, and the Shia that they're going to have to take responsibility for this. And finally, engage not just our friends in that region of the world–the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Egyptians–but engage directly with Iran and Syria, because both Iran and Syria have an interest in Iraq not going totally chaotic. I mean, if you just look–for a moment, just think about Iran. They're in a situation where–and by the way, we–it should be pointed out that Iran has actually participated in support–while they have done some bad things, they provided supplies, equipment to these Shia militia. On the other hand, they have been fairly supportive of the Shia-led government in, in Iraq.
So what is Iran's interest in this? Iran's interest is first of all in not having, you know, a million-plus refugees coming across their western border, which could clearly happen with an all-out civil war within Iraq. Their, their second interest is they are Shia, Shia-dominated country, Iraq is a Shia-dominated country in a Sunni-dominated Muslim world. They're about 10 to 15 percent of the Muslim world. So if this thing were to actually go completely to pot and to spill over, and it became a broader Middle East conflict, they are very much in the minority. And I can assure you they understand that. So we have leverage in dealing with Iraq. Similar leverage, leverage with Sunnis. They don't want to see the refugees coming across their border–Syria, I'm sorry. They don't want to see the refugees coming across their border; they're Sunni not Shia. But they also have an interest in not seeing this thing go chaotic. But they will never participate in stabilizing the country as long as we are the occupying force there.
RUSSERT: If, in fact, you withdrew 40,000 troops and the situation was, in your words, " totally chaotic," would you have the option of bringing the troops back into Iraq?
EDWARDS: I can tell you exactly what I'd do as president. I'd start drawing the troops down. I'd bring out the 40,000 to begin with. I'd continue the process in a very thoughtful, orderly way with, with the suggestions of my military commanders on the ground. The second thing I would do is I'd have very close, 24-hour-a-day monitoring of what's happening with the situation on the ground to see if it's, in fact, deteriorating. As we reduced our presence over time, I think we'd need to keep troops in the region. The redeployment, I believe some, some American men and women should come home, some should go into Kuwait, some should go into Afghanistan, which we haven't talked about, which is moving south, unfortunately. The Taliban's resurging, heroin trade is way up. So those are the things I would do. The troops, I'd keep–I'd keep an able presence in the Persian Gulf, and then I would watch and monitor what's happening.
And I–at the–simultaneous with that, I would be working with both my intelligence leaders and my military commanders to develop a policy about–a plan, not a policy, about what we would do in the case this thing blows into total civil war. Hard to predict. You don't know how, how, how bad it would be. But you clearly would have to have some mechanism for containing so that this thing doesn't spill over. You'd want the Syrians and the Iranians to be involved with that, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, everybody that, that borders, borders Iraq. And there's some obvious things to do. In fact, I thought–I saw that Ken Pollack discussed this on your show last week. But you need to plan for every possibility. Because the overwhelming message from this N.I.E. report, you know, the Democrats will pick out their stuff that they want to argue and the Republicans will pick out their stuff. The overwhelming message, though, is we are in a terrible place in Iraq, and the choices are bad and worse, and we have to prepare for, for the worst possibility.
RUSSERT: Do you think that the Bush administration is planning for a war in Iran?
EDWARDS: I don't know. I don't know. I hope not. I don't know. I think that there's a legitimate concern about Iran getting a nuclear weapon. We should be concerned about that for a lot of reasons, including the possibility that, first, that they would use it; second, that it could, could nuclearize the Middle East, the most volatile place on the planet. But what's disturbing is that we're not dealing with this in a smart way at all, in my judgment. Here–what we've got is a radical leader, Ahmadinejad, who's bellicose in his rhetoric about America, bellicose in his rhetoric about nuclear weapons and about Israel, but he is not politically stable in his own country. He is–first of all, the political elite have largely left him, there are religious leaders who have left him. He was elected on a platform of economic reform and strengthening the middle class and lifting people out of poverty. He hasn't done anything about any of those things. What he's doing instead is he gives speeches and he travels around the world drawing attention to himself. And what this has done is it has begun to isolate him from his own people.
Now, what would strengthen him? A military strike by America against Iran would strengthen him. They would rally around this guy. On top of that, we would see retaliation. It'd be hard for them to get to us, except through terrorists, but they–we got 100,000-plus American men and women right next door, and there–a lot of us believe that there's an infrastructure for retaliation if that were to happen. What–what's much smarter for us to do, certainly now, for the time being–no American president should ever take any option off the table–but what's smarter for us to do now is to continue to tap into this growing isolation between this radical leader and his own people.
And what should be done, in my judgment, is we ought–we ought to work with our friends in Europe. You know, actually, the banking institutions in Europe have been pretty good about being tough on Iranian banks. The governments have been less good. But we ought to put an offer of both sticks and carrots on the table. We ought to make it clear that there are things that America and the Europeans are willing to do–it'd be great if we could get the Russians and the Chinese to participate–but certainly the Europeans, they have economic leverage with Iran. And those things include making the nuclear fuel available to them, controlling the cycle–this has been offered before–but combining that with a set of economic incentives that will be very attractive to the people in, in Iran who're already feeling an isolation from this president. And then on the stick side say, 'But there will be consequences if you don't give up your nuclear program. And the consequences are the economic decline that you're seeing within your own country will be accelerated, and it will be accelerated because the bank–the banks in Europe and the European governments will not continue to do economic business with Iran.'
RUSSERT: Would President Edwards allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon?
EDWARDS: I–there's no answer to that question at this moment. I think that it's a–it's a–it's a very bad thing for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. I think we have–we have many steps in front of us that have not been used. We ought to negotiate directly with the Iranians, which has not, not been done. The things that I just talked about, I think, are the right approach in dealing with Iran. And then we'll, we'll see what the result is.
RUSSERT: But they may get one.
EDWARDS: Yeah. I think–I think the–we don't know, and you have to make a judgment as you go along, and that's what I would do as president.
RUSSERT: You said this about President Bush in answer to this question:
" 'You don't believe President Bush is a good man in difficult circumstances trying to do the right thing?' [Edwards was] asked.
" 'I don't believe it. I don't,' Edwards said." You don't believe he's a good man, or you don't think he's trying to do the right thing?
EDWARDS: The context in which that discussion took place was I was describing what I wanted to see and, I think, most of America wanted to see from their president when he spoke about Iraq a few weeks ago. And his policy is obviously enormously important. But beyond that, I think what Americans want in their president, particularly in these hard–we're in very difficult, historic times. I think they want a president that they feel like they can trust and who's being open and honest with them about how difficult circumstances are, what the possibilities are, and to feel like, even though it's hard, even though it's difficult, and even though the president may not be doing what they would do under the same circumstances, that he's a good and decent human being that they believe is trying to do everything he can. I did not see that in George Bush's speech. What I saw in George Bush's speech was a continuation of trying to sell the American people about what's happening in Iraq.
RUSSERT: We're going to take a quick break and come back and talk about health care and a whole lot more. More of our conversation with John Edwards. Decision 2008, Meet the Candidates, will continue after this.
(Announcements)
RUSSERT: Meet the Candidates 2008, presidential candidate John Edwards.
More of our conversation after this station break.
(Announcements)
RUSSERT: And we are back. Senator Edwards, Friday you spoke to the Democratic National Committee about health care. I want to show that clip and come back and talk about it.
(Videotape, DNC Winter Meeting, Friday)
EDWARDS: Can we finally say we stand now and forever for every single man, woman and child in America having health care, universal health care? We will leave no one behind. We will not allow a single family or a single child in America to not have health care coverage and to not have the health care that they need and deserve.
(End videotape)
RUSSERT: Universal health care, noble goal, but that's 47 million more men, women and children. How much would that cost and what kind of plan would you propose?
EDWARDS: It'd cost between 90 and 120 billion a year once it's–once it's fully implemented. I will, on this show and tomorrow, be laying out details of a universal health care plan. Basically, we start with the problem, which are–we want to get–make sure that the 47 million people who don't have health care coverage are covered immediately. Second, we want to do–deal with the costs that middle class families, who may have health care coverage but are worried about paying for it, worried about keeping it. Premiums are up 90 percent, literally 90 percent just over the last few years. So I want to do something to bring costs down for others. And we want to create some efficiencies that allow competition. And, and then finally–here, here's the bottom line. We want to make sure everybody's covered, we want to help middle class families with the costs, we want–we want to try to create competition that doesn't exist today. And I think the best, most effective way to do that I–which is what my plan will be as I lay it out tomorrow, is we take the 46 million, 47 million people who don't have health care coverage, we expand Medicaid, we provide subsidies for people who don't have coverage. We ask employers to play a bigger role, which means they either have to have coverage, or they have to buy into what we're calling health markets. We're going to create health markets all across the country which will help provide some of these efficiencies. One of the choices, by the way, available in these health markets is the government plan. So people who like the idea of a single-payer insurer health plan, that is actually one of the alternatives that people can choose. They'll be allowed to choose. We expand SCHIP; we expand Medicaid. The bottom line is we're asking everybody to share in the responsibility of making health care work in this country. Employers, those who are in the medical insurance business, employees, the American people–everyone will have to contribute in order to make this work.
RUSSERT: Would you be willing to raise taxes in order to help pay for this?
EDWARDS: Yes, we'll have to raise taxes. The, the only way you can pay for a health care plan, from 90--that costs anywhere from $90 billion to $120 billion is there has to be a revenue source. The revenue source for paying for the plan that I'm proposing is, is first we get rid of George Bush's tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year. This plan, in and of itself, creates some efficiencies and helps to reduce the cost of health care globally in America. And then, finally, we need to do a much better job of collecting the taxes that are–that are already owed. And a very specific example of something we should do, we should have brokerage houses report the capital gains that, that people are incurring, because we're losing billions and billions of dollars in tax revenue, and billions and billions of dollars from capital gains not being reported.
RUSSERT: But you'd be willing to increase taxes to provide health care?
EDWARDS: Yes, absolutely.
RUSSERT: What about Social Security and Medicare? There's 40 million people on Social Security and Medicare now. The next 15 years it's going to go to 80 million. The chairmen of the Federal Reserve say, if we do nothing, you'll have to raise taxes by a third and cut all the rest of government by 50 percent in order to meet those demands and expectations of the entitlement programs.
EDWARDS: Yes. Well, we have a huge challenge on this front. I think the starting place is Medicare, not Social Security, simply because Social Security is stronger, longer–significantly longer than Medicare. So let me, if I can, start with, with Medicare. You know, the, the–Medicare has very serious short-term, intense financial problems, and there–and there are things we can do that we're not doing, which is–we ought to have much better chronic care management than we have today. We ought to be investing in a serious and systemic way in preventative care, which we're not doing today. And we have significant fraud and abuse in the Medicare system. It's–every study that's been done demonstrates that. So I think there are things we can do to strengthen Medicare. And we ought to be using like, for example, in my universal health care plan, we create these health markets which require providers to, to compete against each other. We ought to be using the power of the federal government to negotiate better prices in Medicare. And it was a–it was a foolish thing, in the Medicare prescription drug law that was passed, which I voted against, to not allow the government to use its market power to negotiate better prices. And those are all things we can do that will help, help strengthen Medicare.
RUSSERT: But, in terms of Medicare and Social Security, life expectancy is now 78, 79, 80 years old. Would you consider raising the age of eligibility? Would you consider looking at cost of–cost of living increases? Would you look at means testing? Would everything be on the table?
EDWARDS: Well, here's, here's what I think we're going to have to do, actually, in both cases. This is such a hot political issue that it will require serious–this is the one area where it will require really serious bipartisan effort to get anything done. You know, this has been approached and approached and approached in the past. But I do have–and, and so what I would do is, let me first say what I would do as president of the United States, I would bring together leaders on both sides and experts and put–try to put together something that would work on both Social Security and, and Medicare. But, but I just have to put one caveat in here. I heard your description about people are living longer. You know, this applies to my own father and yours, you know, people who, who have–we still have a lot of people in this country who work very, very hard and, when they reach retirement age, they deserve to be able to retire. And I just think we can't ignore the fact that we have made a social contract with millions and millions of Americans, and we can't go out there and just yank it out from under them.
RUSSERT: But what about for Americans, say, who are 50 and younger, the next generation? Could you establish something different for them?
EDWARDS: I think there're multiple ways to do it. You know, we could do–one example is, we now have a cap on, on, on the taxes that're paid. About–it's about $90,000. And does that cap make sense? Maybe not. Do we need to be–do we need, perhaps to–if we're going to raise the cap or eliminate the cap, do we need to have a bubble for middle income families that earn over $90,000 a year? Maybe. I think there're–I think there're tools available to us, and we certainly do need to deal with it.
RUSSERT: After Iowa, January 14th, the caucus next year–you're doing well in Iowa?
EDWARDS: I'm winning there, according to the polls. I don't know if I believe them, but they say I'm winning.
RUSSERT: Next stop is Nevada, January 19th. Big issue there is Yucca Mountain...
EDWARDS: Yeah.
RUSSERT: ...the nuclear repository. You voted against making that a national repository, then you voted for making it a national repository, saying that...
EDWARDS: And that's starting to have a familiar ring.
RUSSERT: You voted–you voted for it before you voted against it. But the thing...
EDWARDS: You said that, not me.
RUSSERT: But now you're saying that maybe the nuclear waste should be stored locally where the waste was produced. Is that your position?
EDWARDS: My position is that, that what's happened with Yucca Mountain is there've been serious questions, including the, the possibility of lying and fraud in the scientific evidence of–that Yucca Mountain would work. I was always concerned, still am, about this nuclear waste being transported around the country. I, I think, at this point in time, it does not make sense to do–to do Yucca Mountain. So the, the, the answer is we have nuclear plants, the, the stuff has to be stored–waste has to be stored somewhere, so it has to be stored where the plants are.
RUSSERT: So in...
EDWARDS: Or in the vicinity.
RUSSERT: So in Seabrook, New Hampshire, the nuclear waste has to be stored in New Hampshire.
EDWARDS: It has to be stored somewhere close by.
RUSSERT: Gay marriage.
EDWARDS: I can't imagine why you asked about New Hampshire.
RUSSERT: It's next up after Nevada. Gay marriage. You said this: " It is [a hard issue] ... because I'm 53 years old. I grew up in a small town in the rural south. I was raised in the Southern Baptist church and so I have a belief system that arises from that. It's part of who I am. I can't make it disappear. ... I personally feel great conflict about that. I don't know the answer. I wish I did. I think from my perspective it's very easy for me to say, gay civil unions, yes, partnership benefits, yes, but it is something that I struggle with. Do I believe they should have the right to marry? I'm just not there yet." Why not?
EDWARDS: I think it's from my own personal culture and faith belief. And I think, if you had gone on in that same quote, that I, I have–I, I struggle myself with imposing my faiths–my faith belief. I grew up in the Southern Baptist church, I was baptized in the Southern Baptist church, my dad was a deacon. In fact, I was there just a couple weeks ago to see my father get an award. It's, it's just part of who I am. And the question is whether I, as president of the United States, should impose on the United States of America my views on gay marriage because I know where it comes from. I'm aware of why I believe what I believe. And I think there is consensus around this idea of no discrimination, partnership benefits, civil unions. I think that, that certainly a president who's willing to lead could lead the country in the right direction on that.
RUSSERT: Do you believe you're born gay?
EDWARDS: I, I, I think that–I, I, first of all, sexual–I'm not an expert on sexual orientation. I, I think that, that, there's a real possibility that people are born gay, yes.
RUSSERT: You don't believe–do you believe that homosexuality is a sin?
EDWARDS: No.
RUSSERT: Do you believe that openly gay men and women should be able to serve in the military.
EDWARDS: Yes.
RUSSERT: And you would do that as president?
EDWARDS: Absolutely.
RUSSERT: Let me ask you about an interview on " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno." Here's the clip right here.
(Videotape, January 10, 2007)
EDWARDS: Could I have beaten Bush?
MR. JAY LENO: Yeah.
EDWARDS: Oh, yeah.
(End of videotape)
RUSSERT: " Could I have beaten Bush? Oh, yeah." How could you have beaten Bush, and John Kerry and John Edwards together couldn't beat him?
EDWARDS: Oh, I–first of all, I wouldn't take that too seriously. I was on Leno, remember? I, I don't think I know, looking back, what would have happened if, if we–either–anybody besides John Kerry, including me, had been the nominee. You, you have to have confidence when you're running for president that you could actually be president.
RUSSERT: Looking at the race now, you have Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Carolina. Is that your strategy, roll through those four states and lock up the nomination?
EDWARDS: My strategy is to demonstrate to voters and caucus-goers that I am prepared to be president of the United States, and I'm what we need as president of the United States, and that I'm doing it because I want to serve my country. That's my strategy. And that I want every voter, every–one of the reasons I'm glad you're having me on the show for the whole time is I want every voter in, in any of these states and in America to know where I stand, to know what I would do as president of the United States, and to know what the differences are between me and the other candidates. I think that, that I start off in a very strong place, but that's why we have campaigns.
RUSSERT: What is your biggest difference with Hillary Clinton?
EDWARDS: I think we have a difference about what we're–from what I've heard–from–about what we ought to do in Iraq right now. We have a difference, at least up until now, about how we feel about the vote that we cast with respect to, to Iraq. I don't know whether Senator Clinton will have a universal health care plan. I have–if she does, I haven't heard it yet. She might. I think that–I think there are substance differences.
RUSSERT: And differences with Barack Obama?
EDWARDS: Less so. I think that Barack Obama, because he is relatively new to national politics, it's, it's not as clear to me where he stands on, on, on issues. And, and no, I'm not faulting him for that, I just–I think he just hasn't been around as long, so he doesn't have as long a track record, so.
RUSSERT: Do you think two years in the U.S. Senate is enough experience to be president of the United States?
EDWARDS: I don't think the test should be how many years you've been in the United States Senate. I think the test is do you have the depth and maturity and the personal characteristics of leadership that America needs in its president? And I think that test will be applied to me, to Senator Clinton, to Senator Obama, and every other person running.
RUSSERT: What's the most important lesson you learned from running for president in 2004?
EDWARDS: That what America needs is leadership, not politicians. We need a leader who has strong–a strong sense of beliefs.
RUSSERT: Are you a different candidate?
EDWARDS: A leader–oh yeah, of course. Yeah. I hope so. I know a lot more, I've worked a lot harder, I've seen what's happening around this country, and I've spent about half my time either overseas or working on issues overseas. I think I have a, a different level of maturity.
RUSSERT: Colts vs. Bears?
EDWARDS: I wish the Panthers were playing. I, I–I'm going to be for the Colts. My mother...
RUSSERT: There goes–there goes the Illinois primary.
EDWARDS: I know. So be it. I'll live with that. Senator Obama's running anyway. My mother went to high school with Jimmy Orr, who used to be a wide receiver for the Baltimore Colts, so I've always been sort of fond of them.
RUSSERT: I won't get to Boston College, North Carolina...
EDWARDS: Please.
RUSSERT: ...but that, that's coming. Senator John Edwards, we thank you very much for coming on here and sharing your views.
EDWARDS: Thank you, Tim.

Interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' "Face the Nation"

February 25, 2007

SCHIEFFER: Senator, thank you for coming this morning.
EDWARDS: Good morning.
SCHIEFFER: I know you've been out on the campaign trail. I found it very interesting, what Governor Schwarzenegger said, number one, about Iraq. He said, "Look, the Congress should either cut the funding on Iraq or it should let the president do what he wants to do."
EDWARDS: Yeah, I think we should do the former. I think the Congress should use its authority, its funding authority to bring down the troop level an initial 40- to 50,000 out of Iraq, and continue to use that authority to redeploy troops out of Iraq over the next year or so.
SCHIEFFER: So you--you basically agree with Governor Schwarzenegger. I mean, on what the Congress ought to do.
EDWARDS: Well, I think he agrees with me.
SCHIEFFER: He agrees with you.
EDWARDS: No, I'm just teasing. I think--I think that we are in agreement about that, as long as he's not suggesting we let the president continue on the course he's on now, which I do not think Congress--do not believe Congress should do.
SCHIEFFER: He also said the whole debate ought to be elevated over and get beyond whether or not Hillary Clinton ought to apologize for her vote on the war. Now, you have talked about that.
EDWARDS: Yeah. I--I think that there are two issues. One is what the situation--difficult situation we're in, in Iraq now, what's the right and responsible course, and telling the American people and the world, for that matter, the truth about that. I also think it's important for those of us who were responsible for voting on the resolution in 2002 to say whatever the truth is for us about that vote. For those who voted for it, including me, if we believe we were wrong--and I believe I was--I think it's important to be honest about that and to say it. But I think that's an individual decision to be made by those who were responsible.
SCHIEFFER: You were up in New Hampshire yesterday, and you told people at a health care forum, "If you don't bring it up, I will,' talking about the war in Iraq.
EDWARDS: Yes.
SCHIEFFER: Is this whole election about Iraq?
EDWARDS: No, I think it's about--I think the dominating issues will be Iraq, health care, energy. I think those are the likely dominating issues. There'll probably also be a lot of discussion about the continued economic disparity in America between those who're doing well and those who aren't. But I think those are the--the most important issues.
SCHIEFFER: You--you had been saying that you are, quote, "the candidate of fundamental change." But again, going back to Iraq and the public debate over it, when I see the United States Senate unable to get a consensus over whether they ought to talk about it, and--and--and debate a nonbinding resolution...
EDWARDS: Yeah.
EDWARDS: I think it is. I think it is as long as the president of the United States is inspiring Americans to take responsibility for their country and to--and to join in the debate, to not just wait for politicians to fight with each other in Washington. I think it's important for the president to make the case both on establishing America's moral leadership in the world and what to do about Iraq, how we transform the way we use energy in this country and get off our addiction to oil and deal with this huge issue of climate change, how we move toward a universal health care system. And I think that case has to be made, not just behind closed doors to politicians in Washington. The case has to be made to the American people, because I think on all those issues, the American people are actually ready for serious transformational change.
SCHIEFFER: Some of your opponents would say that the fundamental changes have been in you and your record, that you've changed your position on a lot of things, not just on Iraq.
EDWARDS: Well, I've--you know, what happens is, for all of us, I hope, is we evolve, we mature. In my case, there was a lot of seasoning that's gone on, both during the last campaign and since that time. I've done a lot of work overseas, for example. And I've learned. I hope we all continue to learn. And I don't think there's been any change in me as a human being, what my fundamental values are. You know, I still want every American to have the kind of chance that I've had, coming from a pretty modest background to having absolutely everything. That's sort of at the heart and soul of why I want to be president. But I think all these pieces--universal health care, changing the way we use energy, dealing with the war in Iraq and elevating the way America's viewed by the rest of the world--are things that I--that I believe deeply.
SCHIEFFER: Well, let's just talk about Iraq, and let's try to get past whether somebody ought to apologize or not. Let's say that you become president and you'll have the opportunity to do everything you want to do about this. What would you do? I mean, isn't there something to what the president says when he says if we just leave there that--that you'll create this haven for terrorists, that they can operate out of there? What's going to happen if your recommendations are followed, I guess, is what I would say.
EDWARDS: Sure. It's a very fair question. I think no one knows what's going to happen. What we're doing is--what I'm doing is using my best judgment under very difficult circumstances. And, as president, the first thing I would do is say to the American people, "We cannot predict with any certainty what will happen.' Now, what I would do if I were president today is draw down 40- to 50,000 troops out of the north and south, continue over time a redeployment--over about a year or so--a redeployment of our combat troops out of Iraq. I'd maintain a presence in Kuwait, probably redeploy some troops to Afghanistan, where we'd need some additional help, maintain a naval presence in the Persian Gulf. And while I was doing that, I would engage the Iranians and the Syrians directly, both of whom have an interest in a stable Iraq, particularly with America leaving Iraq. I will say that I think it's also the responsibility of the president, while that is occurring--or whatever path we're on--to prepare a plan, a strategy, to deal with containment in case this thing does, in fact, go in the wrong direction. Because it could. No matter what course we take, that could happen, and we have to be prepared for that.
SCHIEFFER: When you say you just don't know what--what will happen, can a person run for president making a statement like that, "I don't know what will happen if we leave'?
EDWARDS: It's the truth. It's clearly the truth. I mean, I think the American people know that. I have, I guess, enough faith in our people to think they can accept the truth. I think it's really important for our next president to be viewed as open and honest and decent, to re-establish the trust relationship between Americans and their president. And, by the way, I think it's also going to be crucial for that relationship to be re-established between the president of the United States and the rest of the world.
SCHIEFFER: What happened? How did we get to where we are?
EDWARDS: Oh, I think that there are a lot of different things that happened. What's happened in Iraq has obviously been a bleeding sore for America. But I think, beyond that, what we've seen over the last six or seven years is that raw power alone does not make you a world leader. You actually have to have the moral authority to lead, and, in order for that to be true, people have to see America as a force for good, not a country that they perceive--for right or wrong--to be a bully that's only interested in its own selfish short-term interests. So that means the world--we have to change. We have to tell the truth about Iraq, we have to--we have to start leaving Iraq, but we have to also demonstrate, I think, that we're willing to do things that are beyond our own selfish short-term interests, to lead on things like climate change, the genocide in Sudan--in Darfur, the spread of HIV/AIDS, I mean, things that don't on the surface appear to be in our short-term interest, but are crucial for America to be able to lead. And for America to be able to lead goes to the heart of whether we live in a stable or chaotic world.
SCHIEFFER: Are you going to have to raise taxes to pay for your health care plan?
EDWARDS: Tax--the tax cuts that George Bush gave to people who make over $200,000 a year will have to go away to pay for my health care plan. My universal health care plan costs 90- to $120 billion a year. I do not believe, having spent a lot of time on this, that you can achieve universal health care without--without finding a revenue source, and that's my revenue source.
SCHIEFFER: Just on the straight politics, you, some people say, are the one Fmr. Sen. EDWARDS: Oh, I think it's a bunch of silliness. I was in New Hampshire yesterday, I met probably over 1,000 New Hampshire primary voters, and, in the course of having a bunch of house parties, and you'd be shocked to hear, the only people who asked me about this were reporters. I didn't have a single New Hampshire voter ask me about this. What they're asking about is what are we going to do about Iraq, what are we going to do about Iran, what are we going to do about health care, the thing's you'd expect them to be concerned about.
SCHIEFFER: Why would you tell people they should vote for you instead of one of those two?
EDWARDS: Well, I think I've been through this. I have the seasoning, and--I hope--the seasoning and depth and maturity that's required to do the job. And second, I think it's time to move past these incremental steps, these baby steps, and have real and serious transformational change on some of the issues that we've talked about today, and those are the things that I'm--I'm for.
SCHIEFFER: All right. Well, Senator, we want to thank you, and I hope we'll see you again down the campaign trail...
EDWARDS: Thanks for having me, Bob.
SCHIEFFER: ...as well. Good luck to you.
EDWARDS: Happy birthday to you, by the way.

Remarks in Manchester, New Hampshire

March 15, 2007

A little more than three years ago, I gave a speech here in New Hampshire I called "In Defense of Optimism." Some of you probably wonder if I could give a similar speech today. After all, a lot has happened since then – and a lot of it hasn't been good – the escalation of the war in Iraq, the aftermath of Katrina, health care costs rising, incomes staying flat, mounting evidence of global warming. I could go on.
But as a matter of fact, I am still optimistic – maybe even more so than I was then. I am still optimistic that America can be a country where anyone who works hard is able to get ahead and create a good life for their family. I am optimistic that we can restore America's moral authority. The challenges may be larger, and we may have even more work to do to build a country that lives up to our ideals and our potential. But we can do it.
I am optimistic we can do these things because my own life says it is possible. I am optimistic we can do these things because everything I love about America and our entrepreneurial spirit and sense of decency says it's possible. But most of all, I am optimistic because of you and the millions of people like you. You don't have to look very far or dig very deep to find people determined to make the changes we need. Millions of people are impatient to take control of their own lives and to take the responsibility to get our country back on track. Millions of people who know we can't just wait for the next president to come in and fix all of our problems or for government to do what needs to be done.
Millions of people who know that America is so much more than just a place – America is an idea. And the idea of America – real, fundamental equality – equality of opportunity, equality of culture, equality of respect – equality for all – matters more than ever. Our job is to make the idea of America real for all Americans, and to rekindle that idea around the world.
So I want to take a few minutes today to talk about some of the challenges we face. But I want to spend most of my time talking about the opportunities before us if we have the courage to do what it takes.
Because we have not yet realized the promise of America; we still struggle to live up to the idea. There are still two Americas here at home, one for the powerful and another one for everyone else. And there are two Americas in the world, the America that we aspire to and has been a light to the world, and the one you've seen too often on the news lately.
Here at home, the country with the most advanced health care in the world, we have more Americans without health care – 47 million – not fewer.
In the richest country in the history of the globe, we have more millionaires and more billionaires that ever – but we also have more Americans living in poverty – 37 million people unable to fulfill their basic needs of food and shelter, no matter how many jobs they work – not less.
As someone who grew up in the segregated South it hurts me to say that more than 50 years after the Brown decision, we still have two school systems – one for people who live in the right neighborhoods and one for everyone else. And the truth is that opportunity is too often denied to people because of the color of their skin, their ethnic background, their gender, or their sexual preference.
And you all know that we are not leading the world in a way that lives up to the idea of America – or is good for us here at home.
What we used to call foreign policy has such a profound effect on our everyday lives that there really is no such thing as purely foreign policy anymore. Trade policies affect jobs and wages here and throughout the world. Energy policy affects climate change here and all over the world, and it impacts domestic and foreign security. Poverty is an issue for us here – I could talk about that all day long – but poverty is also an issue directly related to the rise of terrorism and our place in the world economy. A well-known politician from a neighboring state used to say that all politics is local. Today, all policy is local.
We are not going to solve these problems with the usual approaches. These challenges are too big, too connected, and too complicated to be answered with the same old politics of incrementalism. Meeting them requires more than just a new president—it requires an entirely new approach.
To build the America we believe in requires fundamental, transformational change. Not change for the sake of change, but change for the sake of getting to where we know the country and the world can be, should be, and needs to be. Not incremental, baby-step changes, but invigorating, uplifting, challenging, daring, boundary-pushing changes that address the root causes and understand the complexity of our challenges.
So if we are going to lead from this point in the 21st century, we must lead with a bold and confident step – confident in the greatness of the American idea, and bold in our plans to make it real.
To lead the world in addressing the challenges of our century, America must restore our moral authority.
Restoring our moral authority isn't just about feeling good about ourselves. When the world looks to America for leadership, we are stronger and safer, and so is the rest of the world.
Restoring our moral authority means leading by example, and making clear that hard challenges don't frighten us, but call us to action.
To me, there is no better opportunity to make this clear than the enormous challenge of helping the 37 million Americans who live in poverty.
Maybe you've heard the phrase "it's expensive to be poor." Well, it's also expensive for America to have so many poor.
We all pay a price when young people who could someday find the cure for AIDS or make a fuel cell work are sitting on a stoop because they didn't get the education they need.
And don't think for a second that addressing poverty is charity – addressing poverty makes our workforce stronger and our economy stronger.
That is why I've set a national goal of eliminating poverty in the next 30 years – and laid out a detailed plan to do it by creating what I call a "Working Society," building on what we've learned to create solutions for the future.
In a Working Society, we will reward work with a higher minimum wage, stronger labor laws, and tax credits for working families. We will offer affordable housing near good jobs and good schools, and create a million stepping-stone jobs for people who cannot find work on their own. We will help workers save for the future with new work bonds and homeownership tax credits. And we will all take responsibility for the problem of poverty and not just leave it to government.
By building a Working Society, we won't just try the old solutions and the old politics. Instead, we will work, as a nation, to change fundamentally the culture of poverty itself and create the conditions that allow people to lift themselves up into the middle class.
Rebuilding our middle class for the 21st century also means getting at the root of one of the main obstacles to middle class prosperity -- the cost of health care.
Americans spend more than $2 trillion per year on heath care –- more than any other country on earth.
Despite this incredible expenditure, more than 47 million Americans don't have any health insurance at all.
That's not just morally wrong. It undercuts our personal security and our competitiveness in the global marketplace.
That's why I've introduced a true universal health care plan to cover every man, woman and child in America – by the end of my first term as President. I'm proud to be the first and only candidate to do so.
We cannot wait to transform our health care system. My plan sets up health care markets around the country to give people a choice of good health care plans, including a choice between private and government plans. It provides access to preventive care. It creates efficiencies that don't exist today by dramatically lowering administrative costs. Under my plan, if you don't have health care, you will. If you have health care, your costs will go down.
It may seem complicated in its details, but I see health care as a simple matter of right and wrong. I believe every single one of us has equal worth, and we should not treat anybody as better than anybody else. Every American – rich or poor, no matter which America we live in – has the right to health care. My plan delivers it.
Our domestic problems are intertwined with our global challenges, and nowhere is this truer than at the nexus of global warming and energy independence.
Global warming is a problem that is here, now, and not going away. The United States must lead – lead smart, lead courageously, and lead by example.
It is time to ask the American people to be patriotic about something other than war. We need investments in renewable energy – more efficient cars and trucks – and a national cap on carbon emissions.
By taking personal responsibility for our energy use, we can all reduce our impact on the environment in big ways and small. This week, I announced that we're going to do exactly that in our campaign – our campaign is going to be carbon neutral.
Tackling global warming through responsibility and conservation helps reduce our reliance on foreign oil. And reducing our reliance on foreign oil strengthens our national security. But we won't stop there.
By creating a new energy economy – by transforming our energy infrastructure and investing in research, development and deployment of alternative energy technologies – we can not only address global warming and energy independence, we can create more than a million new jobs in America, and lay the foundation for a secure middle class and a manufacturing base for America in the 21st century.
Our education system, too, needs fundamental change. As I said a few minutes ago, more than 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education, our education system remains shockingly unequal. There are nearly 1,000 high schools where more than half of the students won't graduate. Minority 12th-graders read at the same level as white 9th-graders.
Our education system shortchanges the skills our children need for the future – math and science, creativity and critical thinking. Every day you can read reports about how we're falling behind in math and science – our 9th-graders are 18th in the world in science education. We need to fundamentally change the discussion about education in our country, to move beyond a focus on testing and get to the issue of educating our children for the challenges of the 21st century.
We need a serious, sustained effort to turn around failing schools. We should invest in our teachers – the most important part of any school. We need to do more to recruit them, train them, and pay them, particularly in math and science and other places where there are teacher shortages.
Finally, it has been more than a century since we made high school universal, but high school graduates from well-off families are five times more likely to enroll in college. Those who do go to college pick up larger and larger debts. I have a plan called College for Everyone that will pay for the first year of college for anyone willing to work part-time. And this is one of the hallmarks of the fundamental changes we need, we as Democrats. Work and personal responsibility are good things – and we should be encouraging both.
When we're serious about moral leadership at home, we have the standing to assert moral leadership in the world.
And I believe we can begin by leading in areas that – at first glance – might not seem directly related to our self-interest. I'm talking about global poverty, primary education. But I believe if you look closely, it's clear that these areas are in fact directly related to our present and future national security.
We know that terrorists thrive in failed states, and in states torn apart by internal conflict and poverty.
And we know that in many African and Muslim countries today, extreme poverty and civil wars have gutted government educational systems.
So what's taking their place? The answer is troubling – but filled with opportunity if we have the courage to seize it.
A great portion of a generation is being educated in madrassas run by militant extremists rather than in public schools. And as a result, thousands and thousands of young people who might once have aspired to be educated in America are being taught to hate America.
When you understand that, it suddenly becomes clear: global poverty is not just a moral issue for the United States – it is a national security issue for the United States. If we tackle it, we will be doing a good and moral thing by helping to improve the lives of billions of people around the world who live on less than $2 per day – but we will also begin to create a world in which the ideologies of radical terrorism are overwhelmed by the ideologies of education, democracy, and opportunity. If we tackle it, we have the chance to change a generation of potential enemies into a generation of friends. Now that would be transformational.
But the challenge is great – generational struggles require generational solutions – so we must meet the challenge with an audacious plan.
As President I would implement a four-point plan to tackle global poverty – and improve the national security of the United States:
First, we would launch a sweeping effort to support primary education in the developing world.
More than 100 million young children have no school at all, denied even a primary education to learn how to read and write. Education is particularly important for young girls; as just one example of the ripple effects, educated mothers have lower rates of infant mortality and are 50 percent more likely to have their children immunized.
As president, I will lead a worldwide effort to extend primary education to millions of children in the developing world by fully funding the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education by 2015. The U.S. will do its part by bringing education to 23 million children in poor countries, and we will ask our allies to step up and do the rest. It's not just good for our security; it's good for theirs.
Second, we will support preventive health care in the developing world.
Women and children bear the burden of poverty and disease in the developing world. Women in our poorest countries have a 10% chance of dying during childbirth. More than 10 million children die each year from preventable diseases. Many of these diseases are preventable with clean water and basic sanitation or affordable immunizations.
As president, I will convene a worldwide summit on low-cost investments in clean drinking water and sanitation. Under my plan, the U.S. will increase its investment in clean water six-fold.
Third, we can get to the root of global poverty by increasing opportunity, political opportunity and economic opportunity. Democratic rights allow poor citizens to force their countries to create more progressive laws, fight oppression and demand economic stability. Economic initiatives like microfinance and micro-insurance can spark entrepreneurship, allowing people to transform their own lives.
And fourth, I would appoint an individual in the White House, reporting directly to me, with the rank of a Cabinet member, to oversee all of our efforts to fight global poverty. Despite its importance to our national security, the United States still lacks a comprehensive strategy to fight global poverty. We need to embrace the vision of John F. Kennedy, who recognized that "the Nation's interest and the cause of political freedom require" American efforts to lift up the world's poor.
Our current effort has plenty of bureaucracy – over 50 separate U.S agencies are involved in the delivery of foreign assistance. What it lacks is efficiency and accountability. As President, I'll change that.
Accomplishing these goals – ending poverty in America and transforming our approach to poverty around the world, creating a new energy economy, bringing health care to every American, and building an educational system that helps to build and support the middle class of the 21st century– will not be easy.
And attempting them will require a change in our politics.
We can no longer accept having the course of our country dictated by a relatively few people who push onto the rest of us policies that suit their particular interests. We need leaders who insist that all voices are heard, leaders who will take the role Harry Truman defined so clearly: a president who is the lobbyist for all the people who don't have, don't want, and can't afford one.
But this is not just about the leaders. It is also about you taking responsibility for your own country, for your own government, for your own community, for your own family. I was only in the Senate for 6 years, but that was more than enough time to learn firsthand what I feared and what you know: if you see a problem, you can't wait for the government to fix it.
We are at one of those rare moments in history – a time when two paths are clear before us.
On one side is the path we have been on.
It is a path in which we argue over fuel standards while global warming gets worse; where the Senate passes non binding resolutions on the war in Iraq while the war escalates; where the middle class shrinks and disappears while tax cuts for the wealthiest set in; a path where the two Americas is still there and still wrong.
On the other side is that future which we have all long imagined - a future in which America's moral leadership once again makes us strong and secure.
A future in which the gulf between the haves and have-nots is fading because we are actively working to lift our fellow human beings up from poverty. Where every American has health care. Where America leads the world in creating a new global economy powered by clean energy. Where women around the world enjoy the same opportunities as men. A future in which we recognize that our security is not just measured by our military might, but by our ability and determination to build a more peaceful, more prosperous, more stable world.
I believe that future is ours for the taking. We can make it real. We know that. We – the American people – have changed the world before.
Nearly 70 years ago, another generation of Americans faced a world darkened by insecurity.
The storm clouds of fascism and totalitarianism were gathering over Europe and Asia. We were struggling to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. And it was easy to think then that our problems at home were too big for us to try to tackle the problems mounting abroad.
Yet that generation of Americans saw in the challenges of their day not a cause for despair, but a call to greatness.
And they answered it. Not meekly, not uncertainly. But proudly, confidently, and with conviction. Because they had what we have – the idea of America. It's right here.
And in answering that call, not only secured freedom for the people of Europe and Asia – they laid the foundation for a new American economy that produced the greatest expansion of the middle class and the sharpest reduction of poverty in the history of the world.
They turned the 20th century into the American century.
Now it is our turn – to see the challenges we face with an unblinking eye and once again to answer the call.
Proudly, confidently, and with conviction.
It is our responsibility. As Abraham Lincoln once called us, we are still the "last best hope of earth." If America does not lead, who will?
I believe we are up to the task. I am certain of it.
After all, I am an optimist.

Responses to Questions on Iraq at the MoveOn Virtual Town Hall

April 10, 2007

Question 1 - From MoveOn Member Anita Todras, a mortgage loan officer from Coconut Creek, Florida:
In your opinion, what is the best and fastest way to get out of Iraq?
Response
Well thank you. First of all, let me say for the past 9 months, MoveOn members have accomplished amazing things for the progressive movement.
Last year you helped elect a new Congress. And thanks to your relentless grassroots pressure, you've actually helped shift the national debate about ending the war in Iraq from a question of "if," to a question of "how soon." Thank you.
As you probably know, I voted for this war. I was wrong and I take responsibility for that.
Every day this war drags on, it's worse for Iraq, worse for our troops— and worse for our country. We don't need more debate; we don't need symbolic resolutions; and we don't need abstract goals—what we need are binding requirements. And we can't wait until the next president takes office in 2009.
Here's what I believe ought to happen:
Simply put: Congress should use its funding authority to force President Bush to end the war and start immediately bringing American troops home from Iraq.
I've been advocating for Congress to use its funding authority since I voted against the first 87 billion dollar supplemental back in 2003. That funding authority is still the most powerful check we have—if Congress is willing to use it.
I'd propose we begin by capping funding levels at 100,000 troops to stop Bush's escalation and force an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops, which should come out of the north and the south of Iraq.
During that time, we should not allow Bush to deploy any replacement troops to Iraq that do not meet real readiness standards and that have not been properly trained and equipped.
Our withdrawal will help us to directly engage the Iranians and the Syrians to help stabilize Iraq.
The withdrawal of all combat troops should be complete in about a year.
So that's the outline of my plan for what ought to happen. But we should not be talking hypothetically, because we have already reached a critical moment, and what we do right now will make all the difference.
Thanks in part to your hard work, both houses of Congress have recently passed funding bills that set a time table for withdrawal. President Bush has promised to veto that funding, calculating that he can use the bully pulpit to intimidate Congress and get them to back down.
But this is not the time for political calculation, this is the time for political courage. This is not a game of chicken. This is not about making friends or keeping Joe Lieberman happy. This is about life and death—this about war. We are done letting George Bush manipulate the rhetoric of patriotism, only to use our troops as political pawns. If Bush vetoes funding for the troops, he's the only one standing in the way of the resources they need. Nobody else.
Congress must stand firm. They must not write George Bush another blank check without a timeline for withdrawal—period. If Bush vetoes the funding bill, Congress should send another funding bill to him with a binding plan to bring the troops home. And if he vetoes it again, they should do it again.
The American people are overwhelmingly in favor of ending this war. If our side stands firm, if we show courage now, we can finally bring our troops back home and bring this war to an end.
Thank you.
Question 2 - From MoveOn member C. Davey Utter, a retired NBC broadcaster from Venice, California:
What are you going to do about prosecuting war profiteering in Iraq?
Response
Well let me say first I will end war profiteering in Iraq.
What the Bush administration has done is they've signed no-bid contracts with Halliburton and Bechtel to complete billions of dollars of work in Iraq. Not only does this war profiteering waste taxpayer dollars; it undermines the credibility of America's reconstruction efforts in the eyes of the world.
We need to do everything in our power to get rid of fraud and abuse in Iraq. We need to hold powerful corporations like Halliburton accountable for no-bid contracts they've secured through cronyism.
None of you will be surprised to hear that I believe in using the U.S. judicial system to hold powerful corporations like Halliburton responsible for their wrongdoing—I've done it for a long time.
For all new Iraq contracts, we should impose a cap on profits from Iraqi reconstruction. Contractors should be permitted to earn only a reasonable profit on their Iraq contracts, based on the average profits of comparable, competitively bid government contracts. This is a version of the excess profits tax that was imposed during the First and Second World Wars. As President Franklin Roosevelt explained, in a time of war, "the few [should] not gain from the sacrifices of the many."
We should also bar corporations, senior executives, lobbyists and directors from making donations to presidential candidates and political parties for at least a year before or after bidding on a major government contract
Finally, we ought to break the link between government procurement and private sector contracting jobs. Private sector executives seeking government contracts would not be able to take official contracting jobs for 12 months, and similarly, those with responsibility for contracting would not be able to go to firms seeking contracts for 12 months.
Question 3
The Iraq bill recently passed by the House included a version of Rep. John Murtha's proposal forcing the President to certify that troops going to Iraq meet the Pentagon's standards for sufficient training, proper equipment, and overall readiness to fight. Do you support this approach and do you think it should be in the conference committee's final version of the Iraq bill?
Response
Yes.
Representative Murtha's bill echoed the policy that I actually announced in February of this year, I believe in it strongly.
In my policy, I would prohibit funding to deploy any new troops or any replacement troops to Iraq that do not meet real readiness standards and that have not been properly trained and equipped, so that American tax dollars are used to train and equip our troops, and not used to escalate this war.
Requiring the President to make sure that the troops are prepared is actually the best way to stand by our troops and it's also the best way to force this President to change his policy.
The members of the conference committee have to stand strong on this requirement. They should stand up to this President's veto threat and they ought to pass this legislation and stand behind it.
Closing Statement
I spoke earlier about the need for political courage and the need for political courage to trump political calculation.
We know George Bush and Karl Rove will deploy the full fury of their PR machine to blame Democrats for Bush's choice—Bush's choice—to veto funding for the troops.
There are many people in Washington that are going to be tempted to cry uncle and say they'll say we're going to let Bush win another round in this fight.
So where will Congress find the courage to stand firm?
I'll tell you where they'll find it. They'll find in your letters. They'll find it in your calls. They will find it in your voice.
Forty years ago, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a sermon speaking out against the war in Vietnam. He said, "There comes a time in all of our lives when silence is a betrayal."
That has never been more true than it is today. It's true because in the weeks and months to come our voice has extraordinary power to really change things—and that means we have an absolute responsibility to use that power to the fullest.
So that's what I'm committing to—using every opportunity I have in this campaign to speak out for immediate action to end this war. And it's what you're doing—through you work with MoveOn and in your communities.
Together, I believe we will succeed. And it is a great honor for me to join you in that effort.
Thank you all very much.

Excerpts of Remarks at the National Action Network Convention

April 18, 2007

Tonight, I want to talk about intolerance and inequality and the insidious way they feed on each other, hurting not only the people and groups they target, but all of us and the future of our country.
"We've obviously heard a lot about this lately thanks to the repugnant remarks of one broadcaster on the radio and television last week.
"I find it astonishing that there was even a debate over whether Don Imus' comments crossed the line. And I know I don't have to tell anybody here: Don Imus' comments didn't just cross the line. They defined the line that divides this country like the blade of a knife.
"There can be no debate over how much bigotry is too much bigotry. Any bigotry is too much.
"There can be no question of how much intolerance this country can tolerate; we have already tolerated its effects for far too long.
"And let's be crystal clear: Intolerance affects everything, starting with our economy and ending with our ability to lead at a time of massive global change and new threats to our security.
"I think some people really believe that we have put these things behind us; that the civil rights movement took care of all that and everyone is on a level playing field now.
"I think some people really believe that all you have to do to succeed in this country is pull yourself up by your bootstraps and work hard.
"Well, I can tell you, I have traveled all over this country and I have been in the places where people's bootstraps are worn to a thread from all the pulling they've been doing. Places where all the hard work in the world hasn't helped to pull them out of poverty—because the system discriminates and opportunity isn't equal. But if we come together and are honest about it, we can change that and build an America that gives every American an equal chance.
"There is no question in my mind that intolerance is a direct cause of one of our greatest and most threatening problems: the growing disparity between rich and poor, between haves and have nots, between working people and all those powerful forces who do not have their best interests in mind. Because guess what? The people that are usually the targets of intolerance and bigotry are too often the same people who suffer from lack of opportunity, the same people who are left behind. And as long as intolerance pervades our culture, it's far too easy for politicians in Washington to ignore the big changes we need to make in order to end poverty once and for all.
"I don't just talk about these issues here—racial intolerance, the two Americas that still exists—I talk about them everywhere I go, because it's silence that allows them to survive and even thrive. And I hope everyone running for president will do the same, because we have an obligation and the opportunity to help end the silence.
"It's a shame we have to wait for the Don Imus' of the world to provoke a national conversation through bigotry—but we should jump at the chance to have this conversation, not just to look at whatever bigotry lies in our own hearts, but to finally engage on a problem that isn't going anywhere unless we do something about it. And our strength as a nation depends on it."

Remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City: "A Strong Military for a New Century"

May 23, 2007

It is wonderful to be back here at the Council. Thank you for having me.
Last year, I had the great pleasure of co-chairing a Council Task Force with Jack Kemp on the future of the U.S.-Russia relationship. For me, that experience served as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when people of divergent views, bound by a common belief in America's responsibilities as a global leader, can come together to grapple with difficult national security challenges.
Our main conclusions are just as relevant today: that Russia's direction is critically important to America's national security—from non-proliferation and energy security to the spread of HIV/AIDS. And as our report's title made clear, Russia has been headed in the wrong direction, whether in its de-democratization or by bullying its neighbors.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to concentrate sufficient energy on critical issues like getting our relationship with Russia right. Instead, we've been distracted by larger problems created by this president's military and national security policy.
The core of this presidency has been a political doctrine that George Bush calls the "Global War on Terror." He has used this doctrine like a sledgehammer to justify the worst abuses and biggest mistakes of his administration, from Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, to the war in Iraq. The worst thing about the Global War on Terror approach is that it has backfired—our military has been strained to the breaking point and the threat from terrorism has grown.
We need a post-Bush, post-9/11, post-Iraq American military that is mission-focused on protecting Americans from 21st century threats, not misused for discredited ideological pursuits. We need to recognize that we have far more powerful weapons available to us than just bombs, and we need to bring them to bear. We need to reengage the world with the full weight of our moral leadership.
What we need is not more slogans but a comprehensive strategy to deal with the complex challenge of both delivering justice and being just. Not hard power. Not soft power. Smart power.
Nowhere are the problems of this Administration's policies more tragically evident than in Iraq. Iraq's problems are deep and dangerous, but they cannot be solved by the U.S. military alone. My plan calls on Congress to use its funding power to stop the surge and force an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 combat troops from Iraq, followed by an orderly and complete withdrawal of all combat troops in about a year.
The president has played political brinksmanship over the war in Iraq time and time again. He refuses to acknowledge the futility of his approach, disregards the clear message sent by the American people last fall, and falsely claims that the only way for Congress to support the troops is to prolong the war. That's just not true. Congress can support the troops and end the war, which is exactly what the bill they sent the president last month would have done. When the president vetoed that bill, it was the president alone who was blocking support for the troops. Nobody else.
Any compromise that funds the war through the end of the fiscal year isn't a compromise at all, it's a capitulation. As I have said repeatedly, Congress should send the president the same bill he vetoed again and again until he realizes he has no choice but to start bringing our troops home.
We need to get out of Iraq on our own timetable, not when we are forced to do so by events. As a recent Council report put it, the U.S. "has already achieved all that it is likely to achieve in Iraq... [and] staying in Iraq can only drive up the price of these gains in blood, treasure, and strategic position."
Iraq has done tremendous damage to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, our military, and to our moral authority to lead. It has also completely consumed our country's foreign policy debate. In Congress and the White House, the focus has been on when to get out, how to get out, and how quickly. Too little consideration has been given to what happens after we get out—and that is the very least we owe to the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their families, who have sacrificed so much.
I believe that once we are out of Iraq, the U.S. must retain sufficient forces in the region to prevent a genocide, deter a regional spillover of the civil war, and prevent an Al Qaeda safe haven. We will most likely need to retain Quick Reaction Forces in Kuwait and in the Persian Gulf. We will also need some presence in Baghdad, inside the Green Zone, to protect the American Embassy and other personnel. Finally, we will need a diplomatic offensive to engage the rest of the world in Iraq's future—including Middle Eastern nations and our allies in Europe.
As everyone in this room knows, the Iraq War has made it far more difficult to deal with other global challenges—whether it's the worsening situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban is resurgent... the nuclear ambitions of states like North Korea and Iran... the crises in Darfur and Northern Uganda... the effort to help bring peace between Israel and its neighbors... the growing economic and security threats from global warming... the plight of the over a billion people who live on less than a dollar a day... or the vast implications of the political and economic rise of states like India and China and the negative trends in Russia.
Throughout this campaign, I have spoken about what we need to do to deal with these huge challenges. In the future, I will continue to chart a course for America to regain the global stature and legitimacy that we'll need to lead and shape the world our children and grandchildren will inherit.
But that course begins with an understanding of power and its purposes in all its forms—political, economic, moral and, yes, military power. The great Dean Acheson once said that "prestige is the shadow cast by power." If that is so, we risk squandering our prestige—as the current Administration has done—if we misuse and misdirect our tremendous power.
I will also talk more specifically about what I intend to do, as commander-in-chief, to lead our great military and restore the contract we have with those who proudly wear the uniform to defend our country and make the world a safe and better place.
Leading the military out of the wreckage left by the poor civilian leadership of this administration will be the single most important duty of the next commander-in-chief. The next commander-in-chief faces several important questions for the future:
How will we rebuild our military force, which most everyone agrees has been severely stressed, if not broken, by the debacle in Iraq?
What lessons have we learned about how the military should be used?
And what is the right role for our military as we seek to restore our moral leadership in the world?
The answers to these questions are what I would like to talk about today.
I can think of no better time to have this discussion than in the days leading up to Memorial Day. This is a day far more meaningful than ballgames and barbeques. It is a time when we honor those who have sacrificed to protect our freedom.
Memorial Day has always had special meaning for our family. My wife Elizabeth grew up on military bases around the world, as the daughter of a Navy aviator. From the U.S.S. Quincy, Elizabeth's father Vincent took part in the first bombing runs of Japan during World War II. Later, after the war, Elizabeth and her parents returned to live in Japan, where her father was stationed.
World War II was not simply a moment of military glory, a moment of triumph for the citizen soldier. It was much more than that. The generation that won World War II is not called The Greatest Generation because of the victory they earned on the battlefield, but because of what they did with that victory, of what they gave to us and the world. Military power without purpose is ultimately self-defeating. Our active engagement in the world after World War II is an example of why we need a strong military. It reveals the relationship between the strength of our military and the power of American ideals.
Think about the choices our wise leaders made in 1945. It would have been easy enough for America to glance at the devastation and just as quickly look the other way. We had saved the world from Nazism and fascism. We were wealthy and we were safe. Many thought it was time we went home.
But Americans like President Harry Truman and General George Marshall saw the truth: that it would require not only America's military might, but our ingenuity, our allies, and our generosity to rebuild Europe and keep it safe from tyrants who would prey on poverty and resentment. Our leaders resisted the imperial temptation to force our will by virtue of our unmatched strength. Instead, they built bonds of trust founded on restraint, the rule of law, and good faith. They were magnanimous out of strength, not weakness.
General Marshall—one of this country's greatest military leaders—was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership in rebuilding Europe and promoting peace in the world.
In his Nobel acceptance speech, General Marshall said that military power was "too narrow a basis on which to build a dependable, long-enduring peace." As the Marshall Plan demonstrated, the military is only a means to an end; it is only one instrument of our power. It must work alongside—and reinforce—America's moral leadership.
We saw the power of this relationship during the Cold War, when America deterred the Soviet Union from its quest for world domination. We saw it when we established the United Nations and NATO, which have done so much for peace and human rights. After the Cold War, we saw it in Bosnia, where we helped broker a lasting peace. And we saw it again in Kosovo, where we joined our NATO allies to stop a brutal war criminal from perpetrating another campaign of ethnic cleansing.
This is the America where I grew up as a young boy—a strong nation whose moral promise seemed to fill the hearts of almost everyone I knew. We believed that America, like a beacon, could light up even the darkest corners of the world.
As we all saw six years ago, on September 11, America's greatness alone does not protect us from very real threats.
At that moment, the president could have sent a message of swift justice but also moral leadership. He could have told us where destroying Al Qaeda fit into the broader challenges America faces in the new century. He could have asked all Americans to sacrifice in this new struggle, inviting a hopeful new era of citizenship as the ultimate answer to the terrorists' cynical, evil attack.
But he didn't. Instead, he adopted the most short-sighted, ideological policies available. His strategy has put severe strain on our military... tarnished our moral standing in the eyes of the world... and emboldened our enemies.
It is now clear that George Bush's misnamed "war on terror" has backfired—and is now part of the problem.
The war on terror is a slogan designed only for politics, not a strategy to make America safe. It's a bumper sticker, not a plan. It has damaged our alliances and weakened our standing in the world. As a political "frame," it's been used to justify everything from the Iraq War to Guantanamo to illegal spying on the American people. It's even been used by this White House as a partisan weapon to bludgeon their political opponents. Whether by manipulating threat levels leading up to elections, or by deeming opponents "weak on terror," they have shown no hesitation whatsoever about using fear to divide.
But the worst thing about this slogan is that it hasn't worked. The so-called "war" has created even more terrorism—as we have seen so tragically in Iraq. The State Department itself recently released a study showing that worldwide terrorism has increased 25% in 2006, including a 40% surge in civilian fatalities.
By framing this as a "war," we have walked right into the trap that terrorists have set—that we are engaged in some kind of clash of civilizations and a war against Islam.
The "war" metaphor has also failed because it exaggerates the role of only one instrument of American power—the military. This has occurred in part because the military is so effective at what it does. Yet if you think all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail.
There's an emerging consensus inside the armed forces that we must move beyond the idea of a war on terror. The Commander of the U.S. Military's Central Command recently stated that he would no longer use the "long war" framework. Top military leaders like retired General Anthony Zinni have rejected the term. These leaders know we need substance, not slogans—leadership, not labels.
The question is, what should replace the war on terror? Since the end of the Cold War, folks here at CFR and elsewhere have been engaged in an effort to be the next George Kennan and define the era. As all of you know, we need a new strategy for rebuilding a strong military for a new century.
Any new strategy must include new preventive measures to win the long-term struggle and fuel hope and opportunity. This includes strong and creative diplomacy, and also new efforts to lead the fight against global poverty. I've proposed a plan to lead an international effort to educate every child in the world. As president, I would increase foreign assistance by $5 billion a year to make millions of people safer, healthier, and more democratic, and by creating a cabinet-level post to lead this effort.
Any new strategy must improve how we gather intelligence. From my years on the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know how difficult this can be. We must always seek to protect our national security by aggressively gathering intelligence in accordance with proven methods.
Yet we cannot do so by abandoning human rights and the rule of law. As two former generals recently wrote in the Washington Post, "If we forfeit our values by signaling that they are negotiable... we drive... undecideds into the arms of the enemy." And we must avoid actions that will give terrorists or even other nations an excuse to abandon international law. As president, I will close Guantanamo Bay, restore habeas corpus, and ban torture. Measures like these will help America once again achieve its historic moral stature—and lead the world toward democracy and peace.
And finally, a new strategy must have a clear idea of how to rebuild the U.S. military.
For the last four years, the Administration has not only mismanaged the war in Iraq. It has mismanaged the military itself.
We all know the historic irony here. The president and his team held themselves out as stewards of the military. During his campaign in 2000, then-Governor Bush went to The Citadel in South Carolina and said our military power should be used, and I quote, "wisely, remembering the costs of war." His team came into office with decades of experience. They promised that, quote, "help was on the way." They made bold pronouncements about new military doctrines like "transformation" and an "end to nation-building." They held themselves out as saviors, called themselves Vulcans, and cast their opponents as amateurs who should bow down before their slogans and gestures. They even disregarded the advice of highly-decorated military officers themselves.
The results have been a disaster. This Administration's policies have been particularly hard on our military men and women and their families. President Bush could have called on all Americans to sacrifice. But the only ones who have been at war—the only ones asked to sacrifice—have been our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and their families. And that's wrong.
I am here today to announce a new pledge to America's servicemen and women, their families, and our veterans. We will stand by you just as you have stood by us. As president, I will implement a defense policy based on five major principles:
Ensuring that our military policy is planned and executed to fulfill essential national security missions, not some ideological fancy;
Repairing the tremendous damage done to civil-military relations;
Rooting out cronyism and waste and increasing efficiency in the Pentagon;
Rebalancing our force structure for the challenges of the new century, including improving our capabilities to help weak or failing states;
And taking a broader view of security throughout our government.
With these steps, we can begin to rebuild an American military for a new century.
First, we must clarify the mission of a post-Bush, post-9/11, post-Iraq American military for the 21st century.
We must be clear about when it is appropriate for a commander-in-chief to use force. As president, I will only use offensive force after all other options including diplomacy have been exhausted, and after we have made efforts to bring as many countries as possible to our side. However, there are times when force is justified: to protect our vital national interests... to respond to acts of aggression by other nations and non-state actors... to protect treaty allies and alliance commitments... to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons... and to prevent or stop genocide.
Yet we must remember the complementary relationship between military force and diplomacy. Too often during the past six years, this Administration's diplomatic efforts have left the U.S. with two unacceptable options: do nothing or use force. We must do better than that. We should always seek to solve problems peacefully, preferably working with others. Yet one of the oldest rules of statecraft is that diplomacy is most effective when backed by a strong military. That does not mean, however, that every problem needs a military answer; far from it.
Our military has three important missions: deterring and responding to aggressors, making sure that weak and failing states do not threaten our interests, and maintaining our strategic advantage against major competitors.
The first mission is deterring or responding to those who wish to do us harm. I want to make one thing absolutely clear: any American president must be able to act with swiftness and strength against anyone who will do us harm. But by elevating this right to a doctrine of "preventive war," this Administration has only isolated us further. Our goal must be to defeat Islamic extremists and limit their reach, not help them recruit and become stronger.
A second mission is to ensure that the problems of weak and failing states do not create dangers for the United States. We face substantial security threats from states that fall apart. These situations are not only dangerous for these countries' civilian populations; they create regional instability and can strengthen terrorist groups that, in turn, directly threaten the United States.
A third mission is maintaining our strategic advantage against major competitor states that could do us harm and otherwise threaten our interests.
In all of these missions, we must continue to strengthen our great partnerships—whether bilateral relationships with friends from Great Britain to Israel to Japan, or through institutions like NATO, which have done so much good for America and the world. While the U.S. does not need permission to protect its interests, we must realize that our strength lies in standing together with the world, not apart.
Next, we must also re-establish a strong connection with military leadership. The past few years have brought the biggest crisis in civil-military relations in a generation. The mismanagement of the Pentagon has been so severe that many of our most decorated retired officers are speaking out. Our constitutional design is clear, and our military leadership clearly must follow a civilian command. But this does not mean that civilians should be able to ram through their pet military projects.
George Bush's civilian leadership at the Pentagon repeatedly ignored the counsel of their more experienced military colleagues. They disregarded wise generals like Ric Shinseki, who advised that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to secure the peace in Iraq.
As president, I will repair this breach. I will institute regular, one-on-one meetings with my top military leadership, so their analysis and advice will not be filtered, and so I will have the best information about what's best for our troops on the ground.
I will also reinstate a basic doctrine that has been demolished by the Bush Administration. Under my Administration, military professionals will have primary responsibility in matters of tactics and operations, while civilian leadership will have authority in all matters of broad strategy and political decisions. As president, I will exercise command, and I will delegate the decision to use force to no one. But I will also remove any civilian or military officer who stifles debate or simply tells me what I want to hear.
The Administration's mismanagement of the military has not only breached the faith at the highest levels—it has led to a very dangerous situation for our troops, their families, and our nation.
The military that is fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan is very different from any that's gone to battle before. Today, active-duty servicemen and women are, on average, 27 years old. Guard and Reserve members are, on average, 33 years old. 60% of those deployed have left families at home, and about 50% of those killed in action have left a spouse or child behind. Alarmingly high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder are being reported.
These troops are exhausted and overworked, and we have been forced to dig deeper and deeper to find ground forces for Iraq and Afghanistan. This leaves us ill-prepared for the future. Today, every available combat active-duty Army combat brigade has been to Iraq or Afghanistan for at least one 12-month tour. We are sending some troops back to Iraq with less than a year's rest. To make matters worse, the Secretary of Defense just extended tours from 12 to 15 months, which is unconscionable.
And recruiting has suffered. The Army has been meeting its recruiting targets, but only by lowering its standards. Recruits from the least-skilled category have increased 800% over the past two years. And the Army granted nearly twice as many waivers for felonies and other shortcomings in 2006 as in 2003.
Finally, it is clear that Guard and Reserve members will always play an active and valuable role in the total force of the United States. Yet they have been subjected to repeated and lengthy deployments that do not fit their job description. They also need to be available to respond to disasters domestically.
And as the disgraceful conditions at Walter Reed demonstrated, this Administration has failed our servicemen and women not only in Iraq, but here at home. I will never allow our wounded to be housed in dilapidated, rodent-infested facilities. On the contrary, as I will be announcing in remarks later this week, I will make a new pledge to our veterans, our servicemen and women, and our military families—that our benefits, support services, and readjustment programs properly meet their needs. We owe them no less.
The problem of our force structure is not best dealt with by a numbers game. It is tempting for politicians to try and "out-bid" each other on the number of troops they would add. Some politicians have fallen right in line behind President Bush's recent proposal to add 92,000 troops between now and 2012, with little rationale given for exactly why we need this many troops—particularly with a likely withdrawal from Iraq.
The numbers game only gets us into the same problems as the president's approach. We must be more thoughtful about what the troops will actually be used for. Any troops we add today would take a number of years to recruit and train, and so will not help us today in Iraq.
We might need a substantial increase of troops in the Army, Marine Corps, and Special Forces for four reasons: to rebuild from Iraq; to bolster deterrence; to decrease our heavy reliance on Guard and Reserve members in military operations; and to deploy in Afghanistan and any other trouble spots that could develop.
While such proposals are worth close examination, they do not take into account our withdrawal from Iraq—which I believe must occur in about a year. We need to avoid throwing numbers around for political benefit and instead take a broader view. As president, I will carefully assess the post-Iraq threat environment and consult with military commanders to determine the exact number of troops we need and where.
I will also double the budget for recruiting, and I will raise the standards for the recruiting pool, so we issue far fewer waivers than we do today under the president's policy.
I will put substantial additional resources into maintenance of our equipment and to reset the force. We must spend what it takes to reset our force after Iraq. We have seen a rapid depletion in our military equipment. Over 1,000 vehicles, including tanks and helicopters, have been lost in Iraq, and our equipment is being used at a rate of five to six times its peacetime use.
This inadequacy is especially clear when we look at the demands that have been placed on our Guard and Reserve members. They have been sent to battle without the best equipment. Some units slated to return to Iraq recently reported that they still have outdated equipment. This is unacceptable.
The military budget itself also needs substantial reforms. Today, dozens of agencies perform overlapping tasks, and there is no central, overall accounting of all security activities performed by all relevant agencies.
I will create a National Security Budget that will include all security activities by the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, and our homeland security, intelligence, and foreign affairs agencies. This would allow more oversight and would also allow us to more carefully tailor our expenditures to our missions. Today, literally dozens of agencies have overlapping responsibilities, missions, tasks and programs. We don't link these efforts together nearly enough. We have nuclear proliferation programs in the Defense, State, and the Energy departments. We also have more than fifteen different security assistance programs, running out of both the State Department and the Defense Department.
As president, I will send to Congress a National Security Budget that will grow out of a review of our military, our diplomacy, our foreign assistance programs, our intelligence, our global energy, and our homeland security activities. This budget will provide one government-wide strategy for countering nuclear proliferation; a unified strategy for fighting terrorists; a unified strategy for providing security assistance to our allies; and clear guidance for our agencies on how they should set their budget priorities to make these policies work.
The military has gone a long way in making sure that it's capable and prepared to fight humanitarian crises, as we saw when it provided aid to the victims of the Pacific Ocean tsunami. But this aid is often imbalanced. We've got one agency on steroids—the Pentagon—while the civilian agencies are on life support. As president, I will help rebalance the delivery of civilian services throughout the federal government.
Civilians with training and experience need to be involved in stabilizing states with weak governments, and providing humanitarian assistance where disasters have struck. We need bankers to set up financial systems, political scientists to implement election systems, and civil engineers to design water and power systems. As president, I will create a "Marshall Corps," modeled on the military Reserves, of up to 10,000 expert professionals who will help stabilize weak societies, and who will work on humanitarian missions.
I will also take additional steps to put stabilization first throughout the government. I will put a senior official in the Pentagon to implement these programs. I will harmonize the State Department and Pentagon's overlapping efforts at diplomacy and stabilization better from the White House. And I will implement new stabilization programs at war colleges and staff colleges.
Just as we need to get our national security budget in order, we must also reform our Pentagon budget. The Bush Administration has funneled an enormous amount of taxpayer money to private military contractors, many run by their political cronies. It's no surprise that we have seen rampant overruns in the cost of many weapons programs.
I will respond to the overruns and cronyism strongly and directly. We need a modern-day equivalent of Harry Truman's famous Truman Committee, which traveled the country in the 1940's to find billions of dollars of waste in military spending. As president, I will direct my Secretary of Defense to launch a comprehensive, tough review of fraud, waste, and abuse—and put an end to it. One example is missile defense and offensive space-based weapons, which are costly and unlikely to work.
We also need fundamental reform of our privatization policies. Almost half of Defense Department contracts are now awarded on a noncompetitive basis, giving companies like Halliburton with millions of dollars. To end this, I will direct my Secretary of Defense to overhaul the rules governing privatization, to punish mismanagement, and to reform DOD bonus policies to reward performance.
Finally, I will challenge the military to continue to modernize for a new century. We need to ensure that the U.S. military is the most modern and capable fighting force on the planet. Modernization will also have other benefits. "Greening the military" will increase innovation, save millions of dollars, reduce reliance on vulnerable supply lines, and help America lead the fight against global warming.
We also must do what we can to prevent these problems before they start. This is why I believe it is so important to address issues like global poverty. The reforms I announced two months ago would help stabilize at-risk nations and spread the dream of freedom across the globe—and enhance respect and admiration for America.
Today we need great principles, moral courage, and, above all, a vision—of a tomorrow that is better than today, of a world where the power of example is mightier than the sword.
We need a strong military for a new century, and we need one based on hope, not fear. As Robert F. Kennedy once wrote, "Our answer is the world's hope." Our answer is the world's hope. We will need imagination and courage to imagine great possibilities, to create a world where terrorism belongs to the past. We must, at the same time, rely on our heritage: a time when we were admired by the world, where we shared, with generosity and good faith, our ideals of truth, justice, and equality.
Like a beacon, America can once again provide a clear light for the world—dissolving the fog of injustice, illuminating the path to a new century.
This is the America where I grew up—and it is the America that Elizabeth and I want again to share not only with our own children, but with the children of America, and of the world.
Thank you so much for being here with me today, and God bless America.

Remarks at Cooper Union in New York City: "Building One America"

June 21, 2007

Thank you, Governor Cuomo, for introducing me and for inviting me to share some thoughts with all of you today.
I want to use our time together to continue a conversation about the economic life of our country: those served by it and those left out in the cold; the fundamental values our economy elevates and the ones it violates.
More than that, I want to talk about what we have to do to put our economy back in line with those fundamental values вЂ“ and to put our government back in the service of America's best interests, not the special interests.
It is fitting to continue this conversation here at Cooper Union вЂ“ a school founded by a man who couldn't afford to go to college, but who succeeded and made sure that others would have chances he never did.
Peter Cooper's story is the story of America. A place of optimism and upward mobility, a place where people work hard and sacrifice because they know it will lead to a better life for themselves and their children. And a place where we recognize that we are all in it together.
I know that story well, because it's my story, too. My father had to borrow $50 to bring me and my mother home from the hospital. Now I enjoy all the blessings of America.
Governor Cuomo knows it, because it's his story, too. His father came here without a penny in his pocket or a word of English and he raised his son to work hard and to stand up for the rights of working people.
I'm willing to bet that most of you or your parents or grandparents can tell similar stories.
We call it the American Dream: The right to succeed on the strength of your own merits вЂ“ and the responsibility to help others to do the same.
Nobody gets to pull the ladder up behind them, once they've gotten to the top, and everybody has a chance to make the climb. It's a simple principle of fairness and opportunity, first and always, even in a complex world.
That's the soul of the American Dream. It is what draws people from around the world to our shores; it is what has sustained the optimism of the American people; and it is what has helped build the wealthiest nation in history.
But if you go out and talk to people around this country, they'll tell you, they still believe in the American Dream вЂ“ they just think it's out of reach.
It's hard to call it the American Dream when fewer than a third of Americans thinks life will be better for their children than it is for them.
It's understandable that they feel that way. For the last 20 years, about half of America's economic growth has gone to the top 1 percent.
Today, the top 300,000 Americans now make more than the bottom 150 million put together.
Productivity is up but median income is down. People are making more, while they're making less. Men in their 30s today earn less in real dollars than the men did 30 years ago. More and more women have gone to work, and now married couples with children are working an average of 10 hours a week more than their parents did. Working families with breadwinners in their 40s are almost three times more likely to fall in to poverty than they were a generation ago.
What does all this mean in real terms? It means that our system rewards wealth, not work.
The gap between CEOs and the average worker is out of sight вЂ“ today, the average CEO makes 400 times what the average worker makes.
Our tax system has been rewritten by George Bush to favor the wealthy and shift the burden to working families. That is simply wrong вЂ“ and even those who benefit the most from our current system know that it is wrong.
Warren Buffett once complained that his receptionist loses more of her income in payroll taxes than he does. He called it "class welfare," and he meant welfare for the rich.
Nobody understands these divisions better than the man who introduced me today -- the man who dared to differ with Ronald Reagan's rosy vision of a "shining city on the hill" and who told a legendary "tale of two cities," where the rich and powerful are insulated from the needs of the vast majority of Americans.
Governor Cuomo's words ring as true today as they did in 1984 вЂ¦ or in 2004.
Because there are still two cities. There are still Two Americas.
One America that lives by the paycheck calendar; another that never has to look at the calendar before writing a check.
One America that's afraid it won't be able to leave its children a better life; another whose children are already set for life.
One America вЂ“ middle-class America вЂ“ long forgotten by Washington; and another America вЂ“ narrow-interest America вЂ“ whose every wish is Washington's command.
It's no coincidence that our economy is only working for a few when Washington is only working for a few.
Since 1996, the number of Washington lobbyists has tripled to 36,000. That's 20 times more people than live in my hometown of Robbins, North Carolina. It's 60 lobbyists for every member of Congress. Sixty. And I can tell you from experience, a lot of them are more powerful than the members.
So what happens?
Big insurance and pharmaceutical companies are writing our health care policies to ensure their own profits, not their customers' well being, while 45 million Americans go without health insurance and premiums skyrocket for everyone.
Big oil companies and electric utilities are writing our nation's energy policies. No surprise, they are blocking the development of clean renewable energies we so desperately need, both to protect the environment and to stimulate a new wave of economic growth.
Big financial interests are writing our economic policies вЂ“ and while their profits are setting records, record numbers of families are going bankrupt and losing their homes.
Sallie Mae and other banks are blocking efforts to make college more affordable and student debts smaller. Cable and telecommunications companies are blocking efforts to make high-speed Internet universal and affordable. Accounting software companies are blocking efforts to make it easier for you to do your taxes.
Is it any wonder that so many hard-working, law-abiding middle class Americans feel as if the economic system is stacked against them?
And that's the problem of Two Americas. It's not that some people are doing well вЂ“ Lord knows, that is what we all want. It's that too many people don't even have a chance. It's that the system that should be helping more people to succeed increasingly protects those who already have -- and it's doing it at the expense of everyone else.
There are a lot of people, especially people in Washington, who don't want me to talk about the Two Americas. And if you think they don't want me to talk about middle class Americans, you can bet they don't want me to talk about the 37 million Americans who are living in poverty here in the wealthiest nation on earth.
People tell me, poverty isn't good politics. But what is politics if not the public forum for our highest ideals?
They tell me there are better ways to win votes than to talk about poor people. But this isn't about winning votes: it's about winning back the American Dream for everyone willing to work hard to achieve it.
I'm not surprised, frankly, that people who rigged the system to begin with want to keep it that way forever, forget who gets left behind in the bargain. But the last time I checked, you're not supposed to check your values at the door when you run for president.
And you should not be president if you do not acknowledge the divisions that threaten our economy, our society and our soul.
Abraham Lincoln вЂ“ who once spoke here at Cooper Union вЂ“ famously said that a house divided against itself cannot stand. That is as true in our Two Americas as it was in his.
I have learned something in the last four years, though. It's not enough to talk about the Two Americas. We also need to talk about what we need to do to build One America -- and to do that, I believe we have to build One American Economy.
We should start with the Wild West of the credit industry, where some abusive and predatory lenders are robbing families blind. It's time for a new sheriff in town.
Debt has become the central fact of middle-class existence. Thirty years ago, families saved around 8 percent of their income; today, the family savings rate is negative вЂ“ so families are going more deeply into debt. "Debt collector" is one of the fastest-growing jobs.
We can't afford all this debt, either. There were 1.2 million foreclosures in 2006 -- a 40 percent jump -- and millions more are expected.
Lenders deliberately build in tricks and traps for families. There are all kinds of fees, teaser rates, penalty rates, cross-default clauses. Terms are disguised instead of being disclosed.
As Elizabeth Warren has pointed out, you can't buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of burning your house down вЂ“ consumer protections prevent it. But you can easily get a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out into the street вЂ“ and the lender doesn't even have to disclose the risk.
Our leaders in Washington stand by and watch. Of course, the financial industry is one of the top three givers to political campaigns, so the math just isn't that hard.
It's time we did more than say "buyer beware" while millions of families go broke every year. We should put in place the same consumer protections for financial products that we have for everything else Americans can buy. And when I'm president, I'll do just that.
First, I will create a Family Savings and Credit Commission to make sure that financial services treat families safely.
Right now, there's no sheriff in town. Interest rates were effectively deregulated 20 years ago. States cannot effectively regulate banks because most are based in other states. Federal regulators put bank "soundness" вЂ“ profitability вЂ“ far ahead of consumer protection.
My Family Savings and Credit Commission will change this. It will deal with all financial services -- credit cards, mortgages, car loans, check-cashers, payday loans, investment accounts, and more. It will ban the most abusive terms and make sure consumers understand the others.
Second, I will also pass strong national laws protecting us against the worst abuses in credit markets вЂ“ predatory mortgages вЂ“ abusive credit card terms вЂ“ and payday loans with interest rates of 300 percent or higher.
Finally, I will help create alternatives to abusive lenders. I will help working families build up a cushion by matching their savings and bringing bank accounts to the 56 million without them. And I will support non-profit groups offering affordable, short-term loans. We need a new era of responsible lenders who see families as long-term investments, not quick bucks.
All across the economy, we need to do the same thing вЂ“ take on the special interests and put Washington back on the side of regular families.
We need to take on insurance and drug companies to reform health care, bringing down costs and covering the 45 million uninsured.
The oil and power companies may not like it, but we need to invest in renewable energies and use energy far more efficiently.
And we need to do more to reward the hard work of regular families.
I grew up in a mill town where work was often in short supply, and it was understood that work was the key to upward mobility. It wasn't a chore вЂ“ what I've heard called "a Monday-to-Friday kind of dying." It was a ladder to a better life.
It still is вЂ“ and Americans' hard work is the driving force of our nation's prosperity.
Why then do we do so little to reward the average work of regular families?
It's time the working people of this country knew the system was working for them, not just for their bosses.
We need to reform our tax code. Our current system favors the unearned income of people already doing incredibly well instead of rewarding the work of families trying to get ahead. It has all kinds of loopholes and shelters that lawyers can twist for their wealthy clients. It forces millions of families to hire help to figure out how much they owe. That's just not right.
And we need to strengthen our labor laws. Unions made manufacturing jobs the foundation of the middle class and they can do the same for the millions of new service jobs in the labor market. But businesses routinely вЂ“ and illegally -- block organizing drives by harassing and firing service workers. We need fair laws that let workers form a union if they choose.
These are just some of the things I believe we need to do to build One America вЂ“ and which I will do as president. So you're going to hear me talking a lot more about them.
Not because it's good politics.
Not because it'll win me some more votes.
But because I believe we cannot go on as Two Americas -- one favored, the other forgotten -- if we plan to stay productive, competitive and secure.
Because I believe the backbone of the American economy is the hard work, determination, and ingenuity of the middle class.
And because I believe that the way a strong nation becomes stronger is by giving all its citizens a chance to prosper.
I know that together we can build One America вЂ“ a place where everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream.
A place where our government cares more about people, wages and jobs than it does about profits, corporate prices and campaign contributions.
A place where patriotism means more than supporting a war; it means supporting one another.
That's the One America I want to help lead. And I look forward to working with all of you to build it.
I thank you for taking the time to listen to me today. And now, I'd be happy to take some questions.

Remarks in Des Moines, Iowa

July 26, 2007

Last week, I traveled nearly 2,000 miles to shine a light on some of the great injustices inflicted every day on millions of our fellow citizens. I met health care workers without health care; entire neighborhoods torn apart by predatory lending; and a man who went 50 years of his life without being able to speak because he couldn't afford a $3,000 surgery. This wasn't during the Great Depression. This wasn't in a foreign country. It was here. Now. In America.
I carry these stories and thousands of others just like them everywhere I go. They are a constant reminder of what I'm fighting for and the challenges before us. They're part of a fundamental unfairness that is at the heart of our economy and our society.
This fundamental unfairness is also at the heart of the Two Americas - one for those on top, the big corporations and a few very fortunate families, and one for everyone else.
We have One America that lives by the paycheck calendar; another that never has to look at the calendar before writing a check.
One America that's afraid it won't be able to leave its children a better life; another whose children are already set for life.
One America - middle-class America - long forgotten by Washington; and another America - narrow-interest America - whose every wish is Washington's command.
If you don't think there are Two Americas, let me share with you three facts.
First, the typical CEO makes more by the end of lunch than an average wage worker makes all year - in fact, the income gap is wider than at any time since before the Depression.
Second, the top 300,000 income earners in America now make more than the bottom 150 million combined.
And third, in the past 10 years, the number of lobbyists in Washington has tripled to 36,000. That means there are sixty registered lobbyists for each member of Congress and 20 times more lobbyists than people in my hometown of Robbins, North Carolina.
That's all you need to know to know that Washington is the problem, not the solution. Something's wrong when we have 37 million Americans living in poverty and this kind of income disparity. When 45 million Americans can't get health care, but corporations can get whatever they want from Congress. That may be George Bush's America, but that doesn't mean it's right.
The crowd in charge now hasn't done anything to fix this. The truth is, Washington under George Bush and the Republicans has gone out of their way to make it worse, deliberately circling the wagons around success to ensure that those who have it get even more, instead of creating opportunity to give everyone an equal chance. But that doesn't mean it started when they came into office. Men in their 30s today earn less in real dollars than their fathers did 30 years ago. For an entire generation, regular workers haven't seen a raise. With this reality staring them in the face, it's not surprising that less than a third of Americans now believe the next generation will be better off.
It's time for us to put our economy back in line with our values. It's time to end the president's war on work. And it's time to restore fairness to a tax code that has been driven badly out of whack by the wrongheaded rules of the Washington establishment - more wealth for the wealthy and more power for the powerful. In America, when the middle-class makes money from hard work they shouldn't pay higher taxes than when the rich make money from money.
It's time for us to fight back for the American Dream that says we have opportunity for all and special privileges for none. That success is based on how hard you work, not how much influence you have. That a child's future does not depend on his or her parents' wealth.
*****
None of this happened by accident. Washington is broken. The system is rigged. Cronyism and corporate interests prevail over fairness and the best interests of the American people. Washington puts Wall Street before Main Street. Pharmaceutical companies before patients. Agricultural conglomerates before family farmers. If you want to think about all this in a very simple way, it's that Washington values wealth over work. And it's no surprise - the people with wealth and corporate power are the same people who keep politicians in power. They scratch Washington's back and Washington scratches theirs.
But it doesn't have to be this way. I still believe passionately in the American Dream because I've lived it myself. I came from a family with very little - my father had to borrow $50 to bring me home from the hospital. Now I want for no material thing. I know that we can fix the mess we are in. I know that we can replace Two Americas with One America. We can end these divisions by recommitting ourselves to a government of, by and for the people, but it's not going to be easy.
There are powerful forces that will resist us. These are the same powerful forces I have fought against all my adult life. But I have defeated them before and we will defeat them together because no matter how powerful special interest America thinks it is, there is no one more powerful than the American people and together we can build One America and restore the American Dream we all believe in.
But let me tell you one thing - it's not going to be easy and it's going to take all of us together. Because the people with power aren't going to give it up without a fight. And we can't sit down with them and make a deal. We can't triangulate our way to big change; we can't compromise our way to big change - we need to lead the way to big change. And that starts with me being specific, clear and honest about what I'm going to do.
Fixing the economy is a critical part of putting our country back on track. We won't be able to do this by thinking small or taking baby steps. We're going to have to take giant steps. I want to talk to you about my plans to build an economy that rewards all work and creates opportunities for every American.
To build and rebuild this economy we need to:
Reform our tax system to reward work instead of only wealth.
Negotiate and enforce smarter trade agreements that benefit workers and consumers.
Demand corporate responsibility and ensure that corporations treat workers fairly.
*****
Today, I'm going to focus on our tax code, which is the way we represent our values as a nation in our economy. Our tax code has shifted most of the burden onto the backs of working Americans. There is simply no end to the special tax breaks available to big corporations and wealthy individuals who can afford lawyers and lobbyists.
This is all wrong. It undermines our core values of work and fairness. And, as we've learned in the last nearly seven years, it slows down our economy. The great engine of growth in America isn't the special interests or the money managers: it is the teachers and factory workers and engineers who quietly contribute every day.
I will rewrite our tax code to make sure it is fair and that hard-working families, like those here in Iowa, can succeedвЂ”and so that America can succeed.
This means that poor and middle class families who work hard, save, and do right by their families will pay less. It also means that those at the very top, who have benefited from special break after special break during the Bush Administration, will again pay their fair share.
First today, I'm going to talk about three new tax cuts that will honor values that make our country great: saving, work, and family.
Starting off, we need to encourage families to build assets, so that they each have a nest egg to buy a home, send their kids to college, and retire with dignity. Yet because our tax code gives the biggest savings breaks to the people at the top, most families today don't have the necessary incentives to save.
I'm going to turn that around. I will help millions of American families build a better life by providing each of them a dollar-for-dollar match on up to $500 a year of their savings. We'll call them Get Ahead Accounts, and they'll give millions of families the chance to do just that.
In my case, that chance to go to college meant everything. No young person should be denied that chance because of lack of money, and piling more and more loans onto students is not the answer. That's why I've proposed a national вЂњCollege for EveryoneвЂќ initiative based on the program we started in a rural county in North Carolina, which will help pay for the first year of college for any student who agrees to work part-time and stay out of trouble. In North Carolina, students who never thought they would have the chance to go to college are now getting ready to start this fall. To help families save for college, I'll also let families deposit their child tax credits into college savings accounts.
We are also going to do more to honor work and working families in our tax code. I'll help low-income workers get ahead by creating Work Bonds that match their savings and by letting everyone open a modest savings account tax-free. We'll improve and expand our most important tax breaks for working families - the Earned Income Credit - by cutting the marriage penalty that still hits low-income families and by stopping single workers from being taxed deeper into poverty. Finally, we will expand the child care tax credit so that it covers half of the average child care costs, and expand it to make it much more valuable for millions of working families.
Together, these Get Ahead Accounts, Work Bonds, expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, and expanded child care credit will put America's working poor and middle class back where they belong -- at the heart of our priorities.
While these four significant improvements in the fundamental fairness of our individual tax system will clearly come at a cost to the Treasury, I will pay for these benefits for the lower earning and middle class taxpayers by closing the loopholes and abuses which are now benefiting only the wealthiest in our society.
The place to start is unearned income: capital gains and dividends. Study after study has shown that low capital gains rates applied to the wealth of the wealthiest don't add anything to our economy. They just add to our deficits and take away resources we very much need elsewhere.
As president, I will repeal the Bush tax cuts for families earning more than $200,000 a year. I will also raise the top capital gains rate to 28 percent, while protecting the savings and investments of regular families. A 28 percent capital gains tax rate will help make sure that the wealthiest of Americans pay their fair share of taxes.
If we truly believe in a tax code that values work instead of wealth, then we cannot completely eliminate the estate tax. As president, I will eliminate estate taxes for the middle class, for small business owners, and for family farmers, but I will keep these taxes on the few hundred thousand extremely wealthy families with very large estates above $4 million in value.
If we want a truly fair tax system, then we also have to end the injustices in our system that allow many wealthy people and corporations to avoid taxes altogether. As president, I will declare war on offshore tax havens.
Finally, we need to end the special breaks for insiders. The wealthy shouldn't be given hand outs while working people struggle to get a leg up. We need to close loopholes like the one that lets hedge fund and private equity managers treat most of their income as capital gains.
These several actions, when taken together, will better respect the workers of America, restore fundamental tax fairness, and bring opportunity and advantage to everyone across America, including here in Iowa. The higher capital gains rate on the highest income brackets will pay for the new tax benefits I've proposed today. All of the steps I have proposed will raise well over $50 billion a year to be reinvested in health care, education, and other critical priorities. Investing in Americans and in America unleashed the potential of generations and made this country great, but we lost our way when we sacrificed our nation to the private wealth accumulation of a few.
It's time to stop promoting the wealth of the wealthy and to start making sure that every American who works hard has the chance to move up the economic ladder. With these steps, our tax code will be fairer and our economy stronger.
*****
Today, we've talked about how we need to change out tax code, and in the coming days, I'll be talking about trade and corporate responsibility. Let me just say a word about each today.
Trade is something I don't have to read about in a book or listen to economists spin theories about. I've seen the effects of bad trade deals up close. I saw what happened when the mill that my dad worked in all his life, and that I worked in myself when I was young, closed and the jobs moved away.
When this happened, it was not just devastating to our community economically. Those weren't just jobs that moved away. It was devastating to the pride and dignity of the people who worked hard every day trying to make a better life for their kids. Unfortunately, it's a story that is still happening all over America. The labor of the American people has made our country great and we need to honor that labor in our trade policies. I will soon be outlining details about how we can do that.
Jobs aren't the only things we've lost in this generation. A generation ago, corporate America generally viewed their responsibilities as being equally split among their shareholders, employees, communities and the nation. Companies that had a strong sense of obligation to the country gave American workers the tools to out produce the rest of the world. Companies prospered and so did our workers and the economy.
Soon, I'll also be talking about specific things we can do to get corporations back in line with our values.
*****
How we structure our tax code and how we treat our workers says everything about the kind of society we are.
Are we a country where the few decide the fate of the many?
Are we a country where CEOs and executives have a lower tax rate than their workers and most of the nation's taxpayers?
Are we a country that only values greed, profits and cronyism?
This is not our America. We are better than this. The United State of America is better than this.
Washington thinks the American people don't care about the Two Americas.
Is this true? Do we care?
The American people care. I know they care. As I've traveled the country, I've seen that they care.
If we want to live in a moral and just and fair America - an America where everyone is equal, an America where everyone pays their fair share, an America that values hard work - if we want to live in this America, then I need you.
I have decided what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I'm going to fight every day for the millions of Americans whose voices are ignored by Washington. My question to you, and the question I would ask you to ask yourselves, is what are you going to do?
How much are you willing to do?
How much do you love America?
Because if we want to build One America; if we want to put our economy back in line with our values; if we want to make Americans believe in the Dream again, then we need you. We need you to speak out. We need you to take action.
The great movements in this country didn't start in the Oval Office, they started with the American people. I believe we can build One America, and I know that together we will.
Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.

Remarks in Cedar Rapids, Iowa

August 6, 2007

Good morning. It's good to be back in Iowa with all of you today. I was recently here to talk about the fundamental unfairness at the heart of our economy today and what we need to do to fix it. I focused then on our tax code and how we can reform it to honor work, not just wealth. And in the coming weeks I will address the issue of corporate responsibility.
Today, I want to talk to you about one of the most important economic issues facing America - trade, especially its effect on jobs.
Over the past few years, I've traveled across this country and met with so many honest, hard working Americans, including many right here in Iowa, who've been left behind by our economy.
During one of my trips a couple of years ago, I met Doug Bishop. For years, Doug worked at the Maytag plant in Newton. He worked hard for Maytag day in and day out. And then Maytag decided to cut costs by cutting Doug's job.
Doug was lucky. After eight months out of work, he's back on his feet now, a leader in his community. But many other people in Newton - and across America - haven't been so lucky. They're as eager to get back to work as Doug was, but they're still struggling.
These people did everything our country asked of them. Everything. They had jobs, they worked hard at them, and they provided for their families - and in return, they got the rug pulled out from under them. Who was looking out for these workers in Newton? Who was looking out for their families?
Not Maytag. And certainly not anyone in Washington, D.C.
It hasn't always been this way. Workers for generations were at the heart of our country. Hard-working men and women have made America the strongest, most prosperous nation in the history of the world. But today, Washington has turned its back on our workers and their futures.
More than ever, workers face an uncertain world where they feel like no one in Washington is doing what they can to help them.
They're right. Washington isn't looking out for them. Washington is too busy looking out for big business and protecting irresponsible corporations.
Trade has become a bad word for working Americans for a simple reason - our trade policies have been bad for working Americans. Washington looks at every trade deal and asks one question, and only one question - is it good for corporate profits?
They don't look at what it will do to workers, to families, to wages, to jobs, or even to the economy. When it comes to trade, the only thing that matters in Washington is the big business bottom line.
And most of big business is only looking out for its profits, not its people. Instead, they should be paying attention to a simple truth - corporations can be successful and responsible at the same time.
We need new trade policies in America that put workers, wages and families first. Not fourth, not third, not second. First. What we need is trade without trade-offs. Trade without trade-offs for workers. Trade without trade-offs for jobs. Trade without trade-offs for the environment.
We need trade without trade-offs for America.
Corporations, and the executives who lead them, need to realize that creating American jobs is not only the responsible thing to do, it's the patriotic thing to do.
But that's certainly not what is happening today. America is bleeding jobs.
Since President Bush took office, 5 million jobs have been lost to trade, including many here in Iowa, and 15 million more jobs may move offshore within the next decade. And don't let anyone tell you it's just low-skilled jobs that we'll lose - it's also many of our country's high quality service and technology jobs - jobs that require advanced education such as in computer programming, radiology, call centers, and financial analysis.
But it doesn't begin or end with just the jobs being outsourced to China, India and elsewhere. The negative effects from globalization are ripping through the economy.
Globalization has helped stunt the growth in wages for American workers. Workers in America must now compete every day with workers overseas earning miserably low wages with no benefits. And what's even worse, big multinational corporations now use the excuse that they have to ship ever more good-paying American jobs overseas in order to compete with the very low wage jobs they themselves created there. In the last few years, wages have fallen for nearly every educational group, all the way up to masters degrees - and corporate profits have nearly doubled.
Rather than create income gains for all, the gains from globalization are mostly flowing to the most fortunate Americans. Globalization is a major reason why income inequality is at its worst since before the Great Depression.
It shouldn't be this way. And when I'm president, I'm going to tell the lobbyists pulling the strings in Washington and the big corporations that hire them the same thing - their time is over. The system is rigged against regular Americans to guarantee more power for the powerful and more wealth for the wealthy. Well, I'm going to cut the rigging down and end the game.
Washington's values are all wrong, but the American people's values are exactly right. We believe in hard work, fairness and opportunity. Just like we always have. And we're going to restore those values to our economy and our government.
I know the American people want change, real change. Washington isn't working for them. Our economy isn't working for them. But by uniting together, we can fix this. We can make sure that working and middle class families again have the opportunities to which they're entitled.
While CEOs have been sitting in their boardrooms and while lobbyists and Washington insiders having been dining in their steakhouses, I have been on the ground. Meeting workers. Walking picket lines. I've walked past far too many manufacturing plants with locks on their gates and weeds in their yards. I've heard firsthand from workers how they're one crisis away - one pink slip, one trip to the emergency room - from going over a cliff. But I've also seen firsthand their determination to fight - for their families and for our values.
We'll need courage and conviction and backbone to go up against these powerful lobbyists and insiders. Half measures and baby steps won't level the playing field. Triangulation and compromise won't fix anything. It won't be easy, but together - you and me and everyone who is sick of listening to Washington say one thing and do another - we can stand up and change this country for the better.
*****
And we certainly need change, especially in our trade policies. For years now, Washington has been passing trade deal after trade deal that works great for multinational corporations, but not for working Americans.
For example, NAFTA and the WTO provide unique rights for foreign companies whose profits are allegedly hurt by environmental and health regulations. These foreign companies have used them to demand compensation for laws against toxins, mad cow disease, and gambling - they have even sued the Canadian postal service for being a monopoly. Domestic companies would get laughed out of court if they tried this, but foreign investors can assert these special rights in secretive panels that operate outside our system of laws.
When economists say that trade helps our economy overall, we need to be honest about the fact that it does not help everyone. The true measure of our economy isn't found only in the size of our GDP or the level of corporate profits - it's whether middle class families are doing better or worse.
A sure sign that our trade and economic policies are seriously out of whack is our trade deficit. Our nation's imports have increased by a staggering 50 percent in the past 15 years, and instead of a trade balance, the United States now has the largest trade deficit in the history of the globe - and it just keeps growing. Last year, our current account deficit was more than $850 billion, which is a staggering 6.5 percent of our nation's entire GDP, and our trade deficit with China alone was $233 billion. That means that we are consuming billions of dollars more in imported goods than we produce - and we are borrowing heavily to pay for them.
Behind all these numbers and statistics are the faces of millions of Americans forgotten in our trade deals. Well, I can tell you that I will never forget them. I saw what happened when the mill that my dad worked in all his life, and that I worked in myself when I was young, closed and the jobs went somewhere else. It wasn't just devastating to our community economically -- it was devastating to the pride and dignity of the people who worked hard every day trying to make a better life for their kids.
Let me tell you, if a CEO thinks the right thing to do is to ship American jobs overseas, to destroy families and communities, then I challenge him to go and look those workers in the eye and have the guts to tell them to their face that they can't compete. I've stood with these workers all across America - and let me tell you, they can compete, because they are the best workers in the world.
The trade policies of President Bush have devastated towns and communities all across America. But let's be clear about something - this isn't just his doing. For far too long, presidents from both parties have entered into trade agreements, agreements like NAFTA, promising that they would create millions of new jobs and enrich communities. Instead, too many of these agreements have cost us jobs and devastated many of our towns.
NAFTA was written by insiders in all three countries, and it served their interests - not the interests of regular workers. It included unprecedented rights for corporate investors, but no labor or environmental protections in its core text. And over the past 15 years, we have seen growing income inequality in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
Well enough is enough. Americans have paid the price long enough. We need to change our fundamental approach to trade. We need to make American values the foundation of our trade deals, and we need to put workers back at their core.
*****
Let me tell you, no one is asking for any guarantees. America has the most open economy in the world, and no one is suggesting that we put up tariffs or go back to protectionism. Any politician who promises to bring back the jobs we've lost isn't telling the truth - no one can bring back those jobs. But with a level playing field, American workers can compete with anybody on earth. And I'm absolutely not suggesting an end to trade.
I am calling instead for an end to lip service. Our leaders in Washington say many of the right things. They even say that they will make sure the gains from trade are shared with everyone. But when push comes to shove, the trade gets pushed forward and the sharing gets shoved off.
We can and we must change this. I believe we need to follow three principles to make sure globalization works for everyone.
First, trade deals must benefit workers, not just big multinational corporations. Today, our trade agreements are negotiated behind closed doors. The multinationals get their say, but when one goes to Congress it gets an up or down vote - no amendments are allowed. No wonder that corporations get unique protections, while workers don't benefit. That's wrong.
Imagine trade policies that actually put American workers first. We need fair rules for workers, and we need strong protections for labor and the environment and against currency manipulation. If a deal is good for middle-class families, it's good for America; if it's not, it's not.
Second, our trade policies should also lift up workers around the world. This struggle over fair trade is about more that just what's at stake for America's workers - it's also about what's at stake for workers in every country. Making sure that workers around the globe are treated fairly and share in trade gains is the right thing to do morally, it's the right thing to do economically, and it will make us much safer and more secure. That's what strong labor standards are all about. Making sure that workers have the right to organize and earn a fair wage will not only prevent a "race to the bottom" on labor rights - it will also help build a global middle class that shares in the gains from trade and creates markets for U.S. exports.
Third, we need to address more than just our trade policies in order to restore fairness and opportunity to workers. I talked earlier about some of the adverse effects of globalization - stagnant wages and rising inequality. To help regular Americans get ahead and stay ahead, we need to make sure our children get a quality education and have the chance to go to college. We need to raise the minimum wage, strengthen unions, and help families build assets. And the most important thing we can do to provide security to our workers is to guarantee universal health care in this country. I am proud to be the first major candidate to come out with a plan for universal health care.
We also need to invest resources to ensure that our country keeps its competitive edge in the world. We need to create the jobs of the future right here in America and make sure our workers have the skills they need to fill them. We need to make the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit permanent, invest in life sciences and biomedical research, strengthen math and science education, and create a new energy economy.
There are so many things we can do to put our economy back on the side of the working men and women who make this country great. Our trade policies have a huge impact on whether regular Americans - in Iowa and across the country -- have the chance to get ahead in our economy or whether they are left behind.
We need a new era in trade policy. We need "smart trade" policies that American workers can say yes to - trade policies that do more than pay lip service to their needs and that actually make sure prosperity is shared. Trade policies that are as innovative as the American people. And when I'm president, those are the trade policies we will have.
And let me be clear: we will make sure that these policies are in place before we pass a single new trade deal.
In my first year in office, I will spend time working with Congress to get our trade policies straight -- policies which ensure that Americans workers finally begin to see benefits from the global economy. And then, when we negotiate new trade deals it won't just be big multinational corporations whose interests are served - it will also be the interests of American workers, America's communities, and our global environment.
*****
First, I will be a tough negotiator on new trade deals. There are good trade deals and there are bad trade deals, and when I am president it will be crystal clear that we have a president who knows the difference. It is not enough for a trade deal to be popular on Wall Street or show up in economic statistics. My main measure is just this one - after considering the impact on jobs, wages and prices, will most families be better off? When I'm president, our trade agreements will give workers fair and level playing fields. All our trade partners must meet basic labor standards, such as prohibiting sweatshops and child labor and protecting the right of workers to join unions. These conditions should be the floor, not the ceiling. And they should not be in side agreements, but at the core of the agreements. I will tie unilateral trade preferences and bilateral trade agreements to progress on labor rights. As president, I will also push the World Trade Organization to begin to address labor standards. And I will build on the precedent of the Cambodia textiles agreement, which rewarded progress on labor rights with greater market access. New trade agreements must also include strong rules on environmental protection and against currency manipulation. As the world's biggest customer, our trade deals can be vital tools to ensure that progress is made in stopping global warming. They can also be tools to ensure that poor environmental practices do not create unfair competitive advantages. Second, I will insist that our trade deals be fairly and fully administered. For free trade to be fair, it must be based on rules, and then those rules must be followed. But right now, many major U.S. trading partners are breaking the rules without any consequences.
As president, I will seek to restore America's moral leadership of the world, and our trade policies with these countries can help. But we are going to be tough in our negotiations because the overriding obligation of the president of the United States is to put America's workers, economy and national interests first.
Right now, China, India and certain other nations are each, to one degree or another, combining miserably low wages and poor environmental practices with tax breaks, subsidies, tariffs, low-cost loans, and currency manipulation to advance their trade at the expense of ours. All of this is costing Americans high-quality jobs and threatening millions more.
When I am president, restoring fair and balanced trade with China will be a particular priority. Its massive manipulation of the yuan has continued for years, giving it an unfair advantage against U.S. manufacturers, and its labor and intellectual property protections are grossly inadequate. As a result of the massive trade deficits we run with China - the largest ever between any two countries, more than $230 billion last year alone - China now owns $1 trillion in U.S. assets, giving it great leverage over our economy and our security. This is not acceptable. We need to persuade China's authoritarian government to commit to the rules that govern the conduct of responsible nations. Our trade policies are a great opportunity for increased leverage over China. And, when I'm president I will make it crystal clear that doing business with China should not come at the expense of American jobs or our economy - there must and will be balance between our nations when we trade.
As for our good friend India, which has achieved remarkable economic growth in recent years, we still must work hard to get it to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of its trade agreements with the U.S. and to further achieve our shared values, while all the while improving the lives of its millions of citizens.
I know following the letter of any law, let alone trade law, isn't a priority for the Bush administration, but it will be for mine. In the Edwards Administration, the top prosecutors at the Department of Justice will be responsible for enforcing our trade agreements. Right now, the trade negotiators charged with enforcing agreements seem to think their job is done when an agreement is signed. Signing a trade deal should be the beginning of the process, not the end. And I will insist that we finally begin to prosecute illegal foreign subsidies, currency manipulation, and trade practices.
Fair terms of trade also mean fixing our own tax code so that corporations aren't rewarded for closing plants and shipping jobs to countries like China. Our government should be encouraging businesses to invest here. Yet, one of the starkest examples that our economy works best for big business instead of regular Americans is that we actually give tax incentives to companies to invest overseas. American companies setting up shop in tax havens often pay little or no U.S. tax. This is not only wrong, it's unpatriotic. I will eliminate the tax incentives that encourage companies to invest overseas rather than here at home. These dollars, if invested in new facilities and in retraining workers and rebuilding devastated communities, can fuel a dramatic expansion of our own economy. Third, we need much more investment in helping the workers and communities left behind. When we sign a trade deal, we know which industries and workers will likely be affected by greater competition. We need to restore some honesty to the trade debate and not claim, like too many presidents from both parties have done, that trade will help everyone. This is simply not true.
When I am president, every trade agreement will be subject to not only an economic assessment showing how imports and exports will be affected by the agreement, but also to a "community impact assessment." We need to make sure trade deals produce real benefits that are widely shared, and we need to get a head start on helping any workers and communities who will be hurt by increases in imports or by competition from other countries. Before I ask Congress to approve any new trade agreement, we will have an honest discussion about the real impact of that agreement on towns and communities and workers across our country.
Then we can go into dislocated communities - starting before the jobs are gone - and help them diversify their economies with initiatives modeled on the military base closing commissions, bringing local leaders, employers and unions together to rebuild local economies. We need to be much more aggressive about helping workers and affected communities.
Training is no substitute for good trade policies, but we must help workers gain new skills and get ahead. The problem is that, too often, training programs are completely disconnected from the job market. I will create a broad new Training Works program that ties retraining to real jobs. It will support on-the-job training programs through partnerships among businesses, unions and community colleges. Workers will be trained on-the-job to make sure the jobs actually exist. And to make it worth businesses' while - and to support high-wage jobs - we will pay part of workers' wages while they are being trained.
All types of workers are affected by globalization, and all types of workers should be eligible for help getting back on their feet. But Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, now only helps manufacturing workers at plant closings.
Because most unemployed workers who lose their jobs aren't even covered by unemployment insurance, I will help states modernize their programs. This will give security to 500,000 more jobless workers a year, including more low-wage and part-time workers.
And, as we have seen over the last year, another dark side of trade is the concern over the safety of the foods we eat, the toys our children play with, and even the medicines we take.
Now more than ever, we need to make sure that our trade rules protect American consumers.
Food imports have doubled in the past decade, and Americans now eat three-quarters of a pound of imported food every day. However, less than 1 percent of imported food is inspected.
As president, I will enforce mandatory "country of origin" labeling for food and other consumer products so that Americans will know who is making the products they are buying. The big meat packers have blocked this law for too long. I will give the FDA all the authority and resources it needs to keep tainted food and products out of our country and out of our homes.
We will strengthen enforcement to ensure that safety standards are being met, and we will enforce "zero tolerance" and immediately freeze the specific import of any food, toys, medicines, or other goods that threatens the health of our children and families. We will not let them in until we know they are safe, because the health and welfare of our children are more important than cheap toys.
We must make sure that trade is not only smart and good for America's economy and workers, but safe for American families. Regular families - their safety and their best interests - should come before the interests of multinational corporations. That's what safe and smart trade is about.
You know, some people as they listen to my new smart trade vision for America will accuse me of being a protectionist or anti-trade. They would be wrong. I believe in smart and safe trade, just not trade that helps American multinationals but hurts America.
And, let me tell you, you can protect the interests of American workers and still trade. We can grow our economy, and create good jobs and trade responsibly, fairly and safely. With smart trade policies, we can make sure American workers compete on level playing fields. With smart trade policies, we can create a new future where even more workers and their families have a chance to achieve the American Dream.
I know we can make trade and our economy work for regular workers, but real change must first begin with ending - once and for all - the influence lobbyists have on trade policies and on our government. It's time Washington worked for the American people, not for lobbyists and insiders. It's time that the president stood up and fought for American workers. It's time to have a president that always - always - puts the interests of the American people first.
So today, I'm again calling on all federal officeholders and candidates from all political parties to join me in putting an end to the money game in Washington by simply refusing to accept any form of campaign donation from federal lobbyists going forward. It's really just that simple. We need to send a message to all of the lobbyists in Washington: Your money is no good here, and we're not going to take it anymore. We don't need you, we've got the American people on our side.
*****
What I've just said today isn't going to be popular with the special interest groups, lobbyists or Washington insiders. But this isn't about being well-liked. This is about doing what's right.
They're going to try to distract you and me from the issues that matter - issues like health care, poverty, jobs and economic fairness.
And it's these insiders in Washington who are going to attack us to try to keep people like me from speaking out, but they won't succeed. Because I'm going to fight with every breath I have. Because this isn't about me or them - it's about you, your family, your children, and how those who run for president are going to fight for real change to create a better America where all of us can go as far as our hard work and God-given talents will take us.
That's the kind of president I will be.
As Harry Truman said, "The ultimate test of any presidential decision is вЂnot whether it's popular at the time, but whether it's rightвЂ¦If it's right, make it, and let the popular part take care of itself.'"
We know we don't have to live in an America where hard-working men and women are struggling to get by. Where we pass trade deal after trade deal that rip apart communities. Where good people like those who worked at Maytag do right by their country and are still left out in the cold.
That's not our America. Our America says if you work hard, you'll have the chance to get ahead and leave your kids a better life. That's the One America we're fighting for. That's our America. And together, I know we can make our One America a reality because the real power of America isn't in Washington, it's with the American people. It's with all of you.
And that is why when I'm president, real change is coming.
Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.

Remarks in Hanover, New Hampshire: "To Build One America, End the Game"

August 23, 2007

This election is unlike any we have faced before. The stakes are higher. And the challenges we face as a nation are greater than at any time in memory.
We as a nation must choose whether to do what America has always done in times like these -- change direction and move boldly into the future for the sake of our children, if not for ourselves, or wander in the same stale direction we have traveled in our recent past.
The choice we must make is as important as it is clear.
It is a choice between looking back and looking forward.
A choice between the way we've always done it and the way we could do it if we dared.
A choice between corporate power and the power of democracy.
Between a corrupt and corroded system and a government that works for us again.
It is caution versus courage. Old versus new. Calculation versus principle.
It is the establishment elites versus the American people.
It is a choice between the failed compromises of the past and the bright possibilities of our future. Between resigning ourselves to Two Americas or fighting for the One America we all believe in.
As always, at these moments, the choice we make is not for us, but for our children and our great country. And this time, like no other time, the consequences for our children are truly profound.
Will we halt global warming, protect our environment and humanity from the cataclysmic consequences of inaction and leave our children a livable world rich in the resources that were left to us?
Will we prevail against terrorism by stopping those who would harm us and winning over the minds of those who have yet to take sides so that instead of an ever more dangerous and war-torn world, our children live in a nation that is safe, strong and once again viewed throughout the world as a truly moral leader?
Will corporate greed be all we value as we move further into the global economy, or will we put workers and families first, so that all jobs pay fair wages, every American has health care and corporate profits work for democracy and not the other way around?
Will we face our future as individuals, each of us asking, "What's in it for me?" Or will we return to the central value that makes our nation great? That we are all in this together and each of has a responsibility to the common good.
The choices we make will determine not just the quality of life our children will inherit, but the fate of the world we leave behind.
To succeed for our children where we have too often failed for ourselves, we must choose a new course. Those wedded to the policies of the 70s, 80s, or 90s are wedded to the past -- ideas and policies that are tired, shop worn and obsolete. We will find no answers there.
But small thinking and outdated answers aren't the only problems with a vision for the future that is rooted in nostalgia. The trouble with nostalgia is that you tend to remember what you liked and forget what you didn't. It's not just that the answers of the past aren't up to the job today, it's that the system that produced them was corrupt -- and still is. It's controlled by big corporations, the lobbyists they hire to protect their bottom line and the politicians who curry their favor and carry their water. And it's perpetuated by a media that too often fawns over the establishment, but fails to seriously cover the challenges we face or the solutions being proposed. This is the game of American politics and in this game, the interests of regular Americans don't stand a chance.
Real change starts with being honest -- the system in Washington is rigged and our government is broken. It's rigged by greedy corporate powers to protect corporate profits. It's rigged by the very wealthy to ensure they become even wealthier. At the end of the day, it's rigged by all those who benefit from the established order of things. For them, more of the same means more money and more power. They'll do anything they can to keep things just the way they are -- not for the country, but for themselves.
Politicians who care more about their careers than their constituents go along to get elected. They make easy promises to voters instead of challenging them to take responsibility for our country. And then they compromise even those promises to keep the lobbyists happy and the contributions coming.
Instead of serving the people and the nation, too many play the parlor game of Washington -- trading favors and campaign money, influencing votes and compromising legislation. It's a game that never ends, but every American knows -- it's time to end the game.
And it's time for the Democratic Party -- the party of the people -- to end it.
The choice for our party could not be more clear. We cannot replace a group of corporate Republicans with a group of corporate Democrats, just swapping the Washington insiders of one party for the Washington insiders of the other.
The American people deserve to know that their presidency is not for sale, the Lincoln Bedroom is not for rent, and lobbyist money can no longer influence policy in the House or the Senate.
It's time to end the game. It's time to tell the big corporations and the lobbyists who have been running things for too long that their time is over. It's time to challenge politicians to put the American people's interests ahead of their own calculated political interests, to look the lobbyists in the eye and just say no.
And it's time for the American people to take responsibility for our government -- for in our democracy it is truly ours. If we have come to mistrust and question it, it is because we were not vigilant against the forces that have taken it from us. That their game has played on for so long is the fault of each of us -- ending the game and returning government of the people to the people is the responsibility of all of us.
But cleaning up Washington isn't enough. If we are going to meet the challenges we face and prevail over them, two principles must guide us -- yes, we must end the Washington game, but we must also think as big as the challenges we face. Our ideas must be bold enough to succeed and our government must be free to enact them without compromising principle or sacrificing results.
One without the other isn't good enough. All the big ideas in the world won't make a difference if they have to go through this broken system that remains controlled by big business and their lobbyists. And if we fix the system, but aren't honest with the American people about the scope of our challenges and what's required of each of us to meet them, then we'll be left with the baby steps and incremental measures that are Washington's poor excuse for progress.
As Bobby Kennedy said, "If we fail to dare, if we do not try, the next generation will harvest the fruit of our indifference; a world we did not want, a world we did not choose, but a world we could have made better by caring more for the results of our labors."
But if we do both -- if we have the courage to offer real change and the determination to change Washington -- then we will be build the One America we dream of, where every man, woman and child is blessed with the same, great opportunity and held to the same, just rules.
For more than 20 years, Democrats have talked about universal health care. And for more than 20 years, we've gotten nowhere, because lobbyists for the big insurance companies, drug companies and HMOs spent millions to block real reform. Instead, they've grudgingly allowed incremental measures that do nothing but tinker around the edges -- or worse, they've hijacked reform to improve their own bottom line. So today, more Americans go without health care than ever before. Instead of prescription drug reform that brought down the cost of drugs, the lobbyists for the big drug companies got us a prescription drug bill that boosts drug company profits but doesn't cut patient costs.
I have a bold plan to finally guarantee true universal health care for every single American and cut health care costs for everyone. My plan will require everyone -- business, government and individuals -- to contribute something to reach universal coverage. And I am honest about the cost: $90 to $120 billion a year, and I'll pay for it by repealing the Bush tax cuts for families above $200,000. If we end the game in Washington, we can finally have a health care system that treats the health of all our people with equal worth.
Dependence on foreign oil is smothering our economy and choking our environment. Everybody knows it -- politicians from both parties have been calling for energy independence for 30 years. So what did the oilmen in the White House do? They handed the keys to the corridors of government over to the lobbyists for the big oil companies and let them literally write the energy bill. Now, gas prices are through the roof, carbon emissions are unchecked, and global warming is likely getting worse.
When I am president, we will cap greenhouse gas pollution and ratchet it down every year. We will avoid mistakes like nuclear power and liquid coal. We will invest in clean renewable energies generated in America and create a new era in efficient cars, made by union members here at home.
And look at our economic policies -- from top to bottom, they're a twisted reflection of American values. Instead of expanding opportunity for all and preventing special privileges for any, they hoard opportunity and protect special privileges for the very few at the very top.
Trade policy is all about corporate profits for big multinationals and not at all about lifting workers' wages or creating American jobs. The tax code provides breaks for hedge fund managers -- amazingly, even Democrats backed down from asking them to pay their fair share when Wall Street lobbyists put the pressure on. By the time a decade of corporate opposition to a minimal increase in the minimum wage is overcome, even its own supporters admit that the increase isn't enough -- so another decade of corporate opposition begins anew, and workers lose again.
It's time we put our economy back in line with our values. Let's restore fairness to our tax code by insisting on a simple principle -- nobody in the middle class should pay higher taxes on the money they make from hard work than the wealthiest pay on the money they make from their investments. Let's restore opportunity and responsibility to our trade policy by requiring that every new trade deal puts workers and wages first. Let's reward work by strengthening unions, raising the minimum wage, cutting taxes on working families and with a national commitment to end poverty within a generation.
And let's support our troops and end this war in Iraq. We should immediately withdraw 40-50,000 combat troops immediately and have the rest out in about a year. And when President Bush refuses to act, Congress should use its funding power to force him to act.
None of this will be easy, but all of it is possible.
I know. I've been doing it my entire life.
I am the son of Wallace and Bobbie Edwards. My father had to borrow $50 to bring me and my mother home from the hospital. I am here today because, like all the people my father worked with in the mill, my parents got up every day believing in the promise of America, and they worked hard -- no matter what obstacles were thrown against them -- to give me the chance for a better life.
That's the promise at the heart of the American Dream. What matters to our generation is of little consequence -- in America what has always mattered most is the consequences for our children and their children after them. And no amount of power or money gives anyone the right to break that promise with our future.
I have stood with ordinary Americans at the most difficult times in their lives, when all the power of corporate America was arrayed against them. I have walked into courtrooms alone to face an army of corporate lawyers with all the money in the world. I have walked off the Senate elevator and been besieged by an army of corporate lobbyists. And I have beaten them over and over again.
But let me tell you one thing I have learned from my experience -- you cannot deal with them on their terms. You cannot play by their rules, sit at their table, or give them a seat at yours. They will not give up their power -- you have to take it from them.
We cannot triangulate our way to real change. We cannot compromise our way to real change. But we can lead to real change. And we can start today.
Nearly ten years ago, I made the decision that I would never take a dime from a Washington lobbyist -- I wasn't going to work for them, and I didn't want their money.
Because in the courtroom, when you present your case to the jury, you can offer facts and evidence, you can argue your heart out -- and I have -- but the one thing you can't do, is pay the jury. We call that a bribe. But in Washington when an oil lobbyist gives money to office holders to influence our energy policy, they call it politics. That's exactly what's wrong with this system.
Money flies like lightning between corporations, lobbyists, and politicians. We need full public financing to reform the system once and for all. But we don't need to wait to reform our party. Two weeks ago, I called on all Democrats to reject contributions from federal lobbyists. To tell them -- we know that you give money to influence politicians on behalf of your corporate clients. Well, we're not going to take it anymore. Your money's no good here.
I repeat that challenge today. Let's show America exactly whose side we're on. We can reform our party and truly be the party of the people. And we can expose for all time who the Republicans in Washington are really working for.
There are 60 lobbyists in Washington for every member of Congress. The big corporations don't need another president that looks out for them -- they've got all the power they need. I want to be the people's president.
A few weeks, ago I met a man named James Lowe in Wise, Virginia. James spent the first fifty years of his life without a voice -- literally without a voice -- because he didn't have health care. All he needed was a simple operation to fix a cleft palate. That a man in the richest country in the world could go unable to speak for 50 years because he couldn't pay for a $3,000 operation is something that should outrage every American. We are better than that. America is better that that.
It's a stark reminder of our broken political system that leaves millions of Americans without a voice in their government -- a government that is supposed to work for them.
But it doesn't have to be that way. And we can change it together.
We must think big and end the game.
It's not about being ready to grab the reigns of establishment Washington and stand on the side of corporate elites. If it is, there are plenty who will do a better job than me at protecting the status quo, and preserving the policies and politics of the past.
It's about being ready to lift our country up, reform our party, and remake our government in line with the values of our people. It's about real change and a new vision that meets the challenges of the future and inspires the American people to work together for the common good.
We're all angry at what George Bush has done to our country. But with courage and conviction, with an unblinking eye on the future we believe in and an unbending knee on the road to get there, not only can we undo the damage, we can transform the world. No matter what life has thrown at us, Elizabeth and I have always chosen to be optimistic about the future -- and determined to make a difference as we strive toward it everyday.
I carry the promise of America in my heart, where my parents placed it. Because of them, I believe in people, hard work and the American Dream. I believe the future belongs to us if we only dare to seize it. And I believe to seize it, we must blaze a new path, firmly grounded in the values that first made America great. We must cast aside the established ways of Washington and replace them with the timeless values of the American people. We must end the game controlled by a privileged few and restore the promise that America owes to us all.
On that new path lies One America, where possibility is unbound and opportunity is the birthright of every American. Where the voices of the people are heard again in the halls of government, and government heeds their call. One America, where every individual takes responsibility for our common good, and the chance to reach one's God-given potential is every individual's common right.
I am the son of Wallace and Bobbie Edwards.
And I believe in the promise of America.

Interview Including Elizabeth Edwards with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' "Face the Nation"

August 26, 2007

SCHIEFFER: And good morning again. We are here with Senator and Mrs. Edwards, together. She is playing a major role in this campaign.
Mrs. Edwards, your book is now out in paperback. You have added a new chapter detailing how you found out that your cancer had come back, and that it was here to stay just as John Edwards was starting his campaign. So I have to ask you at the beginning, how are you feeling, and how's your health these days?
Ms. EDWARDS: Actually, I feel great. I have--still have no symptoms, which is a very good sign. My protocol is easy to work around a campaign schedule, and the medications I take don't tire me. Honestly, if you didn't know I had cancer, you wouldn't know I had cancer.
EDWARDS: Actually, she seems to feel great. She's energetic and out there campaigning and speaking her mind. So I'm proud of her.
SCHIEFFER: Well, that's for sure. And we want to talk to you about that, and the role you're playing in this campaign in just a bit. But first I want to talk to Senator Edwards about some of the most current things that are happening.
Iraq and terrorism continue to hang over this campaign and over American life.
EDWARDS: Mm.
SCHIEFFER: And last week Senator Clinton said that--she raised the possibility of a terrorist attack, and said, should that happen, it would give the Republicans an advantage, and it would--and she said she would be the best person, if that happened, to be in charge of that situation, as it were. You came down pretty hard on her. You said she was making a political calculation about terrorism. Why did you say that, Senator?
EDWARDS: Well, there are a couple things that we just disagree about, with all respect to Senator Clinton, who's a--who's a great candidate for president. First is, I don't agree that the Republicans would have an advantage. I would never cede that. I think we are--and this is another issue that we disagree about--I think we're less safe, not more safe. We have fewer allies, and, according to Bush's own State Department, there are more terrorists in the world. So I think we are not safer than we were when George Bush took office, or just prior to September 11th.
And the second issue is, I think when you're talking about something as serious as an attack on the United States of America, particularly if you're a presidential candidate or a president, the focus should not be on politics and on votes, the focus should be on what's going to have to be done to unite America to keep the American people safe. So that's what I was talking about.
SCHIEFFER: In the news this morning, Prime Minister Maliki said this morning that Democrats in the United States who have been calling for his resignation, he said they are treating America as if-or treating Iraq as if it was somehow one of America's villages, as he put it, and he said it is time to start talking about Iraq with more respect. Any thoughts on that?
EDWARDS: Yeah, I think that Maliki should quit worrying about Democrats and the presidential campaign in America and start worrying about what he needs to do in his own country. I mean, everyone knows that, at the end of the day, the Iraq Study Group has said, and most of us have said at this point, there can be no military solution in Iraq. There has to be a political solution. There has to be some compromise between Maliki and the Shia-led government and the Sunni leadership. Otherwise there'll never be stability and security in Iraq. And Maliki, who has been, clearly, a weak leader, needs to be focused on that job.
SCHIEFFER: Do you think he ought to step aside?
EDWARDS: I think that's something for them to decide, not for us to decide. But, at the end of the day, the real test is, are they moving toward a political compromise. Because there cannot be stability in Iraq without it.
SCHIEFFER: Do you think they are?
EDWARDS: No. I think--I can't--if there's any difference, I can't see it. And I know that we're going--Petraeus is going to come forward with his report in September, and I think the--that-at least from my perspective--the test in that report should not just be what's happening with the military and what's happening with the situation with violence on the ground, the question is, has, during this surge, has there been any change in the political situation. And how long are we going to be willing to keep troops on the ground at this level if there's no serious movement toward a political compromise. I think that should be the test for this report that's coming.
SCHIEFFER: Well, when the Senate and the House come back into session at the end of the summer here, the first thing they're going to have to deal with is what to do about Iraq, funding the war.
EDWARDS: Yes.
SCHIEFFER: You're seeing even some Democrats, like Senator Clinton, to go back to Senator Clinton, saying it looks like that maybe the surge is working in the sense that there is less violence there. What do you think the Senate should do here, Senator? I know you have said that you'd like to immediately draw down about 40,000 troops there...
EDWARDS: Yes.
SCHIEFFER: ...and then work from there and eventually get all of them out.
EDWARDS: Yes.
SCHIEFFER: Do you think that's in any way a possibility, or is the president going to be able to ride this out?
EDWARDS: Well, I think there's actually a mandate from America, regardless of what I think. I think America said very clearly in the November 2006 elections that they wanted a very different course in Iraq, and I think the Congress has a responsibility under that mandate, and I think they should stand their ground. I think they should not submit a single funding bill to the president for the war that doesn't have a timetable for withdrawal. And I think they should use whatever legislative tool is available to them, including filibuster.
SCHIEFFER: Including a filibuster?
EDWARDS: Including a filibuster. To do everything--this is not politics. This is about life and death. We have men and women dying in Iraq, and they're dying in part because of what we--what we talked about a few minutes ago. Because the Sunnis...(unintelligible).
SCHIEFFER: Well, you know, Senator Warner, the--perhaps the most influential and respected voice on national security on the Republican side, said last week that it is time to start bringing home at least--he said pick a number, but at least 5,000. And he says no timetable; he doesn't think that's wise to set a timetable, but he did say it's time to start the withdrawal . What about that? Do you think that--you think they should go beyond that?
EDWARDS: I think we should go beyond that, but I'm glad to see that Senator Warner, having just apparently come back from Iraq, is seeing what most of America is seeing, which is the real test here is we have to shift the responsibility to the Iraqis. They have got to feel the heat. And they've got to start moving on political compromise. It's that simple. And the threshold question is, how do you shift that responsibility, how do you intensify pressure on them. And we can't do that until we start taking troops out of Iraq, which I think is exactly what Senator Warner's saying. I'd go far beyond what he suggests, but the truth of the matter is, we have to start taking troops out of Iraq.
SCHIEFFER: In February, you were on FACE THE NATION, and I asked you what would happen if the administration took your advice, did exactly what you say we ought to do. What did you think would happen, and you said, "I don't know.' And I remember asking you at the time, "Can you run for president and say you don't know what would happen if the administration does what you say that it should do?"
EDWARDS: I don't think anybody who suggests to America--and America has been misled and misled about this war, and they're sick of it. They want the truth. The truth is there are no good choices and no one can predict with any kind of accuracy exactly what's going to happen in Iraq. So, if I were president of the United States today, I would do what you suggested earlier, but I would also be very open and forthright with the American people, that we cannot predict what's going to happen. We're going to maximize the chances of success, we're going to do this in an orderly and responsible way, but there's no way to know with certainty what will happen.
SCHIEFFER: But even if it meant a--some sort of a regional conflict that broke out that brought other people in the Middle East into it, you say we have to take that risk to get our people out of there?
EDWARDS: I think we--I think we actually maximize the chances for success by starting to draw down troops in Iraq. I think that what it does is it shifts the responsibility to them, and there's at least some opportunity for them to reach some compromise. I think we should, in combination with doing that, we should engage the Iranians and the Syrians who have a clear interest in a stable Iraq, particularly if America's no longer occupying Iraq. We do have to, I believe, Bob, prepare for the other possibilities. I mean, I would maintain a presence in the region--we have an obvious interest in the region.
SCHIEFFER: Mm-hmm.
EDWARDS: We probably need to be beef up our presence in Afghanistan, we need a naval presence in the Persian Gulf, probably need a rapid deployment force in Kuwait. Maybe should stage some troops in--station some troops in Jordan if we could get staging authority from the Jordanian government.
SCHIEFFER: All right, we'll come back and talk about this some more, and Elizabeth Edwards' role in this campaign when we come back in one minute.
(Announcements)
SCHIEFFER: And we're back with John and Elizabeth Edwards.
Mrs. Edwards, I want to talk to you a little bit about the role that seems to be developing for you in this campaign, and it is most unusual. Some people are calling you the attacker in chief. Others say that we've never had a candidate's wife who's been put in charge of the tough stuff. Usually they are--they are brought into the campaign to talk about the softer side. But yet, you called Senator Obama "holier than thou.' You have said Senator Clinton is not doing a good job on presenting health care. When someone asked why Senator Obama and Senator Clinton were getting so much publicity, you said, "Look, John is not black and he is not a woman, and there's nothing we can do about that.' Do you feel, as a woman, that you can say things in the campaign that perhaps Senator Edwards cannot say?
Ms. EDWARDS: None of this is calculated in any way. I have always been really forthright. I think if I have any value in the campaign--everyone knows I support my husband, obviously.
SCHIEFFER: Mm-hmm.
EDWARDS: Shocking news.
Ms. EDWARDS: But my value is that people trust me, they trust me to say what's on my mind and to be direct. And I answer questions. I answer questions about why it is John uses the Internet so heavily. I think it's partly because the mainstream media is involved with an obviously interesting story between a man of African-American heritage and a woman candidate. These are--that's an interesting story. If he wants to get his policies across, he needs to find someplace other than mainstream media--today excepted--to get that message across. And it wasn't meant in any way to be derogatory of--even of the press. (Unintelligible).
SCHIEFFER: Well, do you think--do you think in some way that the whole dynamic of this campaign has changed because we do have a woman who's leading in the polls now, Senator Clinton? Has that changed the way you campaign?
Ms. EDWARDS: I don't think it does. First of all, I think you have to campaign with blinders on in a certain respect. My idea is--my purpose, I think, is to talk about John's policies. He gives me an incredible buffet from which to speak. You know, the first person on health care, the first person on environmental, the only person with a rural policy, you know, a really aggressive position with respect to Iraq. I've got a lot of things I can talk about out there, and honestly, I--except when asked, I don't--I don't references the differences between John's vote on dedicated funding for Iraq and Senator Obama's, or John's health care program and Senator Clinton's. I don't--I don't volunteer these, but when asked, I try to be trustworthy.
SCHIEFFER: Well, I know--I remember--I remember one time that Ann Coulter, the Republican activist and author...
Ms. EDWARDS: Mm-hmm.
SCHIEFFER: ...was tearing his hide off on, what, Chris Matthews' show. And you just picked up the phone and called, and said, "Hey."
Ms. EDWARDS: Well--but that has to do with, I think--I mean, as a mother, honestly, at-sometimes I've been pretty disturbed about the trend in the political dialogue. If we're arguing about policy, and I'm saying "somebody's health care policy doesn't do this, and somebody--and John's does do--does do what's missing,' that's different than calling--than name calling. And that denigrates the whole process. Turns people off, we have less people voting, and it's really important to get those people engaged because we can't--this is the wrong way for us to go.
SCHIEFFER: Let me talk to both of you about what you--if you should become president, what you envision the role of the first lady to be. I remember when Senator Clinton decided to run for the Senate, I think she had a news conference, or she said someplace, "I'm going to have to put my first lady duties aside now, because I'm going to go run for the Senate.' Well, anybody who looks at the Constitution knows that the first lady has no duties assigned.
EDWARDS: That's right.
SCHIEFFER: I mean, it isn't an elective office in any way. What role would Elizabeth play in your administration if you were elected, Senator?
EDWARDS: Well, she's the person I trust most in the world, so I mean, I would care--we talk about everything. We talk about everything personal to us, our family, our responsibilities to our kids. And we talk about my views and her views on national policy. On most things we agree, on some things we don't agree. But...
SCHIEFFER: Gay marriage, for example.
EDWARDS: That is an example. And I think that there--I want--but I care what she says, and I want to hear what she says. So she would be somebody that I would talk to, and would...(unintelligible).
SCHIEFFER: But would you put her in charge of something? I remember Bill Clinton was campaigning, he talked about "two for one.' I have also known, over years of covering Capitol Hill, members of Congress who've made their wives chiefs of staff.
EDWARDS: Yeah.
SCHIEFFER: In my mind, it never worked, because you're putting somebody in a position that you can't fire. Would she...
EDWARDS: That's true, actually.
SCHIEFFER: Would she ever be in charge of a program, or would she be in charge of initiatives?
Would you want to, Elizabeth?
EDWARDS: Well, I'll let her speak to it. Let me say one thing about it...
Ms. EDWARDS: OK.
EDWARDS: ...before she does. I think that the way we do things, and the way we interact, it's so natural that I would not want to change that. I think titles and specific charges is not the way that we do things together. And I think, because of that, it doesn't make sense. Now, there may be things that she has a particular interest in, and I'll let her speak for herself on that. But I think what she has done during the course of the campaign--being honest, being forthright, being strong--I personally respect, and I applaud her for it. And she will continue to do that, as she has the entire 30 years that we've been married. And I expect her to continue.
SCHIEFFER: Well, I mean, for example, if I were covering the White House, and you did something as president, what if I called up Elizabeth Edwards and said, "What's going on here?' Would she be speaking out, or would she be answering questions...
EDWARDS: Let her say it.
Ms. EDWARDS: Unh-unh. Unh-unh.
SCHIEFFER: ...from the press? What about that?
Ms. EDWARDS: No. I mean, John--I presently respect the way things are done, and John has people who speak for him. And I'm really supposed to be just a mirror for people see him. And what I have to say about it, honestly, is not very important. People will be voting for John. The extent to which I can shed a light on who he is as a person, that's great. I never practiced law with him, partly for some of the reasons that you--that you mentioned. And--but it doesn't mean that he didn't talk to me about his cases; he always did. I think that the first lady gets a megaphone. She doesn't get a job, she gets a megaphone to talk about the things she cares about. I care about veterans' issues--my dad is a veteran--military families--I was raised in one. I care about afterschool programs; we've started one. Care a great deal about what happens with respect to breast cancer and treatment and research. So the--I mean, I have a lot. And that doesn't even mention a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old at home.
SCHIEFFER: But you're not campaigning for a Cabinet office?
Ms. EDWARDS: I am absolutely--not only--I will not accept, nor will I...
SCHIEFFER: All right, all right. We'll take a break here, and we'll come back and talk about life on the campaign trail.
(Announcements)
SCHIEFFER: And we're back now with Elizabeth and John Edwards.
Very quickly, we were talking during the break about how you find out about some of the differences you have, and you said you found out her position on gay marriage when you read it in the paper.
EDWARDS: Actually, that's not exactly right. One of my staff told me that she had just said it in San Francisco. But Elizabeth reminds me, she said--probably said it in front of me, I just wasn't listening.
SCHIEFFER: This happens in various marriages.
Ms. EDWARDS: It does happen. In a--in a 30-year marriage, it does happen now and again.
SCHIEFFER: Your book is absolutely wonderful...
Ms. EDWARDS: Thank you.
SCHIEFFER: ...and it is so--it's a loving love story.
Ms. EDWARDS: Yes.
SCHIEFFER: Beautifully told, it seems to me. You all had your 30th wedding anniversary. I continue to go back to this business of finding out that you had cancer. Do you have any regrets about deciding to just go ahead and live your life as you've done on this campaign?
Ms. EDWARDS: Of course, you don't get to do it both ways, but choosing to fight for the things that we've fought for for a very long time is enormously important to me. It allows me--and John, honestly--to focus on something other than my condition. We get to focus on the fact that other people need health care. You know, we each have stories that we learn along the road that make us realize that, in fact, despite this diagnosis we're actually very lucky. And--because we see people who have diagnoses as terrible as these, but they don't have--they have no health care. So, those people drive us every day and make us glad that we're fighting this fight. I mean, I don't think anybody else has a truly universal health care. They're going to leave some men and some women out, and if they have my condition, it's heartbreaking to think that they don't get the answers to their--to the problems they face in their lives.
SCHIEFFER: I'm told that you are preparing some sort of guide for your children?
Ms. EDWARDS: I actually wrote...
SCHIEFFER: Can you--can you talk about that?
Ms. EDWARDS: ...I wrote that in the 1980s after "Terms of Endearment" came out. I wrote a letter to my children. I thought it was a very good idea, in case you had a sudden death, that you would tell your children things you thought were important that you might not yet have told them. My older children, I've--we've had children in the '70s, '80s, '90s and '00s, so my '70s and '80s children were very young when I wrote this letter. I haven't changed it, honestly, since I first wrote it. It talks about--it talks about religion and the kind of person you marry. I hope they all marry someone as wonderful as John has been to me. And they have--it's just the little things that you might have wished on your deathbed that you had a chance to say.
SCHIEFFER: In your book, you write about that when you found out about this and you announced your plans, some people said to both of you, "You're in denial about cancer.' You said you're not.
Ms. EDWARDS: We're not.
SCHIEFFER: Would you talk a little about that?
Ms. EDWARDS: Well, I think John said this in the press conference, that we're not in denial. We understand the seriousness of this diagnosis. We understand that this disease will probably kill me one day. We're cheering on all the researchers out there, hoping they--all their NIH grants get funded so that--and I have to stay alive long enough for that to happen. But just because you accept that you've got the disease doesn't mean that you have to accept the end of your life yet. You need to keep fighting, as John has decided to do and I have decided to do, for the things that are important to you for the people that matter to you--who matter to you.
EDWARDS: I would do--Bob, I would do anything for her, just to be clear about this. And I--and I said that to her the day--that long day in the hospital room where we got the bad news. But both of us believe that what we're doing is important and this is the cause of our lives, and that's why--that's why we continue.
SCHIEFFER: Well, I want to thank both of you for being with us this morning, and I wish you the very, very best.
Ms. EDWARDS: Thank you, Bob.

Remarks at Pace University in New York City: "A New Strategy Against Terrorism"

September 7, 2007

Thank you for having me here today. Thank you.
On a beautiful, bright September day almost six years ago, a group of 19 men stepped onto four airplanes, intending to kill as many people as they could, intending to terrorize America. Just a few blocks from here, the hijackers crashed their terrible ideology into the American dream.
Nearly 3,000 Americans died on that horrible day in New York City, in Arlington, Virginia, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. They were bankers and busboys, secretaries and firemen, and they were all our brothers and sisters.
Their sacrifice is a harsh and lasting reminder of what must become one of the great goals of our generation—the need to protect our citizens from these horrors, to root out and shut down terrorist cells wherever they fester, to remove the poverty and instability that give radicalism a toehold, and to make terrorism utterly unacceptable among nations everywhere, for all time.
In August of 2001, while George Bush was in Crawford ignoring memos about the threat from Al Qaeda, I authored an op-ed in which I named terrorism as the most vital national security challenge our country would face in the coming years. I still believe that today.
The world stood united behind America after 9/11. But instead of leading a truly visionary campaign against global terrorism, our president led America down a garden path. He used the attacks to justify a preconceived war against a nation he now admits had no ties to Al Qaeda. He then offered belligerence and hostility to the world community, and we have been rewarded in kind.
President Bush, like the Republicans following him today and even some Democrats, was stuck in the past, and he still is. He had no grasp of the new threats we faced, so he failed to offer a vision to keep us safe in a world that had changed. Saddam Hussein was the threat he knew, so Iraq was the war he waged.
We needed new thinking and a bold vision to protect the world for our children; instead, George Bush literally gave us his father's war—but without his father's allies or his father's sense of decency. What's more and what's worse, the so-called "war on terror" he used as his excuse for war in Iraq became his excuse for trampling our Constitution and, most perversely, for ignoring the demands of the actual struggle against terrorism. Because in George Bush's reality, disagreement is called weak, challenge is suspect, and opposition downright unpatriotic.
Six years later, the devastating consequences of the Bush "war on terror" doctrine are so clear that his own Administration has had to admit them.
A recent National Intelligence Estimate found that Al Qaeda is now as strong as it was before 9/11. In a recent survey of America's most respected foreign policy experts, the vast majority said the world is becoming more dangerous for Americans and the United States. The State Department recently released a study showing that terrorism has increased worldwide 25 percent in 2006, including a 40 percent surge in civilian fatalities.
And as everyone here knows, Osama bin Laden is still at large. Six years ago, President Bush declared that he wanted bin Laden "dead or alive." This is his starkest failure. Apparently, bin Laden plans to address America on the anniversary of 9/11. But I don't need to wait and hear what this murderer has to say. My position is clear. I can make you this solemn promise: as president, I will never rest until we have hunted bin Laden down and served him justice.
George Bush's approach to terrorism has not only failed to make the world safer. It has demolished the foundation of America's foreign policy: our relationships with other countries. In the first Gulf War, our allies shared the cost of troops, casualties, and funding. But in the current Iraq War, the Bush approach left us largely on our own, bearing almost all of the burden.
Tragically for America and the world, George Bush's "war on terror" approach walked directly into the trap the terrorists set for us. Islamic extremists wanted to frame the conflict with the U.S. as a war of civilizations, and the Bush Administration, stuck in a Cold War mentality, happily complied.
There is now only one key question we must ask ourselves: are we any closer to getting rid of terrorism than we were six years ago? And the terrible answer is no, we're further away. Today, terrorism is worse in Iraq, and it's worse around the world. So what does all this mean? It means the results are in on George Bush's so-called "global war on terror" and it's not just a failure, it's a double-edged failure.
The Bush approach hasn't only made the terror problem worse. The Administration has rigidly stuck to outdated approaches that are ineffective against the modern terrorist threat. We need a counterterrorism policy that will actually counter terrorism. That matches 21st century threats with 21st century tactics. That replaces Cold War thinking designed to defeat a single, implacable enemy with new world thinking that can defeat a multi-national, diverse, and often hidden foe—not just now, but for the long-term. That's strong, fast, and hard enough to stop terrorists cold, but also smart, honest, and prescient enough to draw people away from terrorism in the first place.
And to do all of this, we must do one thing. We've got to throw away the failed George Bush policies of the past, and move in a bold new direction.
Instead of Cold War institutions designed to win traditional wars and protect traditional borders, we need new institutions designed to share intelligence, cooperate across borders, and take out small, hostile groups.
Instead of a foreign policy of convenience that readily does business with whoever is available and regularly turns a blind eye when our allies behave wrongly or fail to cooperate, we need a new foreign policy of conviction that requires cooperation in exchange for our support, whether it's arms sales, trade, or foreign aid.
Instead of an exclusively short-term focus on the enemy we know, we need a long-term strategy to win the minds of those who are not yet our enemies, by offering education, democracy, and opportunity in place of radicalism, hatred and fear.
Most of all, instead of a reckless, solo pursuit of an ideological agenda that abandons our moral authority and disregards our allies, we need to reengage with the world and reassert our moral leadership.
In a few short days, we will all take time to remember 9/11. This year, we should all make the anniversary not only a time of mourning, but of reflection on the very real choices we face.
We learned on 9/11 the consequences of not dealing with the threat of terrorism. You will have a very real choice to make in this election, and the choice will have consequences. You and your children will have to live with the decisions we make in the next four years.
There is no doubt that some progress has been made. We should thank the professionals who have uncovered plots like the one on John F. Kennedy Airport. Our federal government has been substantially rearranged, and many problems corrected.
But we should not let our enthusiasm for short-term victories cloud the long-term reality. The fact is that George Bush has used 20th century tools to attack 21st century problems. The Bush approach has failed not only because of the shameless political manipulations and reckless decisions of the president and his aides. It has failed because the president is using an antiquated set of weapons against a modern target, and he's misfiring.
Some politicians, like Rudolph Giuliani, Mitt Romney, and John McCain have responded to the shortcomings and backfires of the Administration's approach by essentially doubling-down. They have closed their eyes to the facts and asked us to accept, on faith, more of the Bush approach. Some running for the Democratic nomination have even argued that the Bush-Cheney approach has made us safer. It has not.
For the sake of our nation's security, for the sake of building a safer America, we must take a new direction.
We need a bold new approach—one that is smart, tough, and targeted. This will require us to look beyond the structures of World War II and the Cold War to new tools that will allow us to target terrorism more precisely. It will require sustained U.S. leadership—but the kind that leverages the power of partnerships, rather than going it alone. It will mean raising the level of cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies—while preserving civil liberties and the rule of law.
We saw the promise of a new multilateral approach just a couple of days ago in Germany. The terrorists the German authorities caught were plotting massive attacks on American interests. They had been trained in Pakistan, had a network in Turkey, and were captured through German and American intelligence. We must be able to coordinate similar operations throughout the world—in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and anywhere terrorists would attack.
Now more than ever, the world is ready for a new direction from America. The world is ready to work together against terrorism. But right now, the community of nations lacks any global institution to coordinate counter-terrorist intelligence and security operations. The international institutions of the last century were designed for World War II and the Cold War. Institutions like the United Nations, NATO, and Interpol have taken steps to adapt to the twenty-first century challenge of terrorism, and they serve valuable purposes. And they remain essential to fulfilling our interests. But they cannot be the complete and final answer to shutting down global terrorism.
It's the right time for a bold new direction.
As president, I will launch a comprehensive new counterterrorism policy that will be defined by two principles—strength and cooperation.
The centerpiece of this policy will be a new multilateral organization called the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Treaty Organization (CITO).
Every nation has an interest in shutting down terrorism. CITO will create connections between a wide range of nations on terrorism and intelligence, including countries on all continents, including Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. New connections between previously separate nations will be forged, creating new possibilities.
CITO will allow members to voluntarily share financial, police, customs and immigration intelligence. Together, nations will be able to track the way terrorists travel, communicate, recruit, train, and finance their operations. And they will be able to take action, through international teams of intelligence and national security professionals who will launch targeted missions to root out and shut down terrorist cells.
The new organization will also create a historic new coalition. Those nations who join will, by working together, show the world the power of cooperation. Those nations who join will also be required to commit to tough criteria about the steps they will take to root out extremists, particularly those who cross borders. Those nations who refuse to join will be called out before the world.
It's important to note that CITO is not a panacea, nor will it be perfect. But it would represent the first step in a new direction. As President John F. Kennedy observed when he signed the treaty that first limited the testing of nuclear weapons, we must begin with the common recognition of a common danger. President Kennedy said then, "A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step." Today, this new anti-terrorism organization would be such a first step.
Organizations are only as strong as the people who help make them run, and so we must also improve the quality of our human intelligence—agents better able to understand local culture and make local connections in countries with active terrorist cells. As president, I will lead efforts to improve human intelligence through 1,000 new annual scholarships to improve language skills for students who pursue careers in intelligence and diplomacy.
A terrorist should not be able to escape detection in Europe or the Middle East if a foreign agency could have caught him with the help of American technology and advice. Within six months of taking office, I will direct the Secretary of State, working with the Attorney General and other national security officials, to launch comprehensive strategies to support agencies in other countries.
There is no more urgent task than preventing terrorists from acquiring a nuclear weapon or another weapon of mass destruction. And we will all be better off when the world is free of nuclear weapons.
Diplomacy is key to progress against nuclear weapons. The recent agreement with North Korea to shut down their nuclear programs in exchange for the release of frozen assets is long overdue, but encouraging. It is telling that the few successes of the Bush Administration come from the diplomacy it has derided.
As president, I will create a Global Nuclear Compact to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would support peaceful nuclear programs, improve security for existing stocks of nuclear materials, and ensure more frequent verification that materials are not being diverted and facilities are not being misused. And I will lead an international effort to rid the world of nuclear weapons.
Our chemical plants are also targets for terrorists. A successful attack on any of these targets would be devastating. Because of industry pressure, new watered-down security rules imposed by the Bush Administration may actually weaken security at many chemical plants. I support implementing tough new safety standards at plants vulnerable to terrorist attacks.
We must also work hard here at home to ensure that extremist ideologies do not take hold in our own Muslim communities—and we must do so in a way that respects diversity and civil liberties and avoids practices like racial profiling against both Arabs and Muslims. We must encourage American Muslim participation in public life. I will put new resources toward engaging American Muslims, empowering local mosques to counter extremist ideas, and working hand-in-hand with Muslim communities to identify and isolate threats.
Finally, we must achieve energy independence. If we reduce our reliance on oil from instable parts of the world, Middle Eastern regimes will finally diversify their economies and modernize their societies. And fighting global climate change will reduce global disruptions that could lead to tends of millions of refugees and create massive new breeding grounds for desperation and radicalism.
There are those who are hard-core proponents of terror, and I have spoken here about how we must deal with them.
Yet we also should have a broader, deeper goal—to prevent terrorism from taking root in the first place. Millions of people around the world are sitting on the fence. On the one side are bin Laden and Al Qaeda, and on the other side is America. The question is which way they will go. If they perceive America as a bully, it will drive them in the other direction. If, on the other hand, they see us as the light, the country they want to be like, the country that's creating hope and opportunity, it will pull them to us like a magnet.
We have to be that light again. We need to do everything we can to prevent this generation of potential friends from becoming a generation of enemies.
Several months ago, I proposed a sweeping effort to eliminate the poverty and instability that create the conditions for extremism, including increasing our funding for global primary education to $3 billion a year, expanded microfinance programs, ramping up our support for sanitation and preventive health care in developing nations, and dramatically increasing our promotion of constitutional democracies and the rule of law across the developing world.
And during my first year in office, I will establish a "Marshall Corps," patterned after the military reserves, that will include at least 10,000 civilian experts. Its members will be deployed abroad to serve on reconstruction, stabilization, and humanitarian missions.
Rethinking our approach to terrorism also means rethinking our approach country by country, cell by cell. And in each place where terrorism has taken root, there is a lot more we can do.
We must begin with one of the greatest generators of terrorism in the world today: Iraq. George Bush's failed management of the war in Iraq has made the problem of terrorism worse. The war provided Al Qaeda with a powerful tool for recruiting terrorists. It gave them a battlefield for training. It gave them an attractive target, in American troops. And it diverted the resources of the U.S. military, weakening our force structure in the process.
Even though the presence of U.S. troops has served as an attractive target for terrorists, our eventual withdrawal will not remove the threat. As president, I will redeploy troops into Quick Reaction Forces outside of Iraq, to perform targeted missions against Al Qaeda cells and to prevent a genocide or regional spillover of a civil war.
We can neglect the crisis in Afghanistan no longer. The Taliban is re-taking territory in southern Afghanistan and kidnapping foreigners. As president, I will work with the other members of NATO to ensure that our forces and rules of engagement are robust enough to defeat the Taliban and protect the democratic government in Afghanistan. As part of this effort, I will commit additional American Special Forces to root out and shut down Taliban cells.
Terrorists also take advantage when states don't do enough to stop them. We ought to use our tremendous tools—whether diplomacy, arms sales, trade, or foreign aid—to get states to shut down terrorism. In Pakistan, the recent National Intelligence Estimate found that Al Qaeda has established a safe haven in the northwest tribal areas. We have given the Musharraf government billions of dollars of aid in the last several years, yet they have done far too little to get control over these areas. As president, I will condition future American aid on progress by Pakistan, including strengthening the reach of police forces and working more effectively with tribal leaders and their members to ensure their acceptance of the government. But I want to be clear about one thing: if we have actionable intelligence about imminent terrorist activity and the Pakistan government refuses to act, we will.
And Saudi Arabia is a country we have given too much in return for too little. We must require the Saudis to do more to stop the flow of terrorists to Iraq. As president, I will condition future arms packages on Saudi Arabia's actions against terrorists.
Finally, you may be asking yourself why I am delivering this speech at a college, instead of a think tank—why I am talking to a room full of young people, instead of a room full policy experts.
The answer is simple.
I have spoken of the need to counter 21st century threats with 21st century strategies. To do that, we need 21st century minds. And that means we need you.
Your country needs you. You may not agree with the decisions that got us to where we are today. You may not agree with the policies George Bush is currently pursuing. Everyone in this room knows that I certainly do not.
But we are in this struggle. We are in it together—and America needs you now more than ever.
While the Bush administration used this struggle to divide us, I am asking you to rise to the challenges we face today. To sacrifice. To make a meaningful contribution to our national effort.
It's time to be patriotic about something other than war.
Your country needs your help. Your country needs you to contribute to this effort in ways big and small.
You can dedicate your life to this cause by joining our armed forces or an intelligence agency, to help establish and execute the plan I have laid out here today.
You can join the Marshall Corps that I have proposed, to represent America abroad and help alleviate the poverty that provides the breeding ground for terror.
You can take the lead in bridging the cultural divide by learning to speak Arabic or another foreign language.
You can work or volunteer for an NGO that fights global poverty.
Or you can write and talk to your elected representatives to keep them honest and make sure they are supporting smart policies that will help us end the war in Iraq.
It is these sacrifices that will help restore America's greatness. We must lead the world toward the future, and we must take up the mantle of moral leadership that served us so well in the last century.
The campaign against terrorism will demand toughness and creativity. It will take place in the shadows, in difficult terrain like the hills of Pakistan and the fields of Afghanistan, and in the hearts and minds of millions.
We have a choice today, and it rests in your hands. You are the generation who will help decide whether America will stick with the failed policies of the past, or whether we will aim for the horizon.
Every generation of Americans has faced grave challenges. We have overcome great foes in the past, and we will do so again—in the last century, we closed the chapters on Nazism, Fascism, and Communism through courage, bold new ideas, and strength.
Today, we stand on the shoulders of the generations who faced those challenges in their own time, and who rose to meet them.
Just as they rose to meet the enemies they faced, we must rise to meet ours.
And just as they did, we rise to meet them as Americans.
So challenge your leaders—hold them accountable for creating a safer world. And challenge yourselves—hold yourself accountable for creating a better nation. That is what it means to be American. To reach, to keep on reaching, to never, ever stop reaching for the best that any nation can ever be.
Do we have the vision to imagine a better world? Of course we do. Do we have the strength to protect our people? Of course we do. And do we have the guts to say, we know that this struggle is not just about our future, it is about your future, wherever you live, whoever you are? Of course we do.
Robert F. Kennedy once said that each time we stand up for an idea, we send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and that, together, those ripples can build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.
You can create that current, and you can start today. This is America, after all. We are more than a place. We are an idea. An idea that has changed the world and will change it again and again. We are freedom, equality and respect. A beacon once lit that can never be put out.
We are America, and the future is ours if we have the courage to make it so.
Thank you, and God Bless America.

Interview with Tim Russert on NBC News' "Meet the Press"

October 7, 2007

RUSSERT: ...Senator John Edwards, welcome.
EDWARDS: Thank you, Tim.
RUSSERT: A week ago Wednesday in the New Hampshire debate, Democrats woke up the next morning, I think somewhat surprised that the three top candidates, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards, all said that they could not pledge that all American troops would be out of Iraq by the end of their first term in 2013. Another one of your opponents, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, issued this statement about you. He says, "Edwards says" "he would get all of the combat troops out of Iraq, but he would leave behind thousands of non-combat troops in the middle of a civil war." This "is not ending the war... Leaving behind thousands of non-combat troops contradicts Army doctrine and common sense. It is simply irresponsible. ... History teaches us that putting undermanned forces in the middle of sectarian conflict, whether in Somalia, Lebanon or anywhere" "is a recipe for disaster. John Edwards would change the mission. I," Richardson, "will end the war."
Is he correct?
EDWARDS: No, of course he's not correct. They will–unless we're going to close the embassy in Baghdad and have the only American embassy in the world that we provide no protection for, there'd have to be some troops in Baghdad for purposes of protecting the embassy. Now, what I've also said that is also ignored in that statement is that we do need to maintain quick reaction forces just outside of Iraq.
Now, there are some real differences between myself and Senator Clinton on this issue. I am not for maintaining troops–combat troops–inside Iraq, for a lot of reasons. I think number one, they'll have a target on their forehead while they're there. Number two, it continues the perception that America is occupying Iraq. What I would do instead is outside of Iraq, probably in Kuwait, maintain a quick reaction force. And that quick reaction force would be focused on the possibility of al-Qaeda operations, not terrorism at large. The problem with what I hear with Senator Clinton saying, and I've heard others say is when you talk about maintaining troops, combat troops inside Iraq, based there, and they're focused on anti-terrorism activity within Iraq, that's very similar to what President Bush says. It's very hard to understand what–where that ends, where the limits are.
I do think we need to end this war in Iraq. I'm for getting our combat troops out of Iraq. I'm going to be responsible and protect the embassy like we do everywhere else in the world, but we will maintain a quick reaction force just outside of Iraq in Kuwait, so that if there are al-Qaeda–let me be very specific, not general terrorist activity. I mean, terrorist activity can include any sort of action against civilians and against the state. I'm talking specifically about public enemy number one, al-Qaeda, that's responsible for a small percentage of the insurgent activity in Iraq.
RUSSERT: But as I hear you, you would have significant combat troops outside of Iraq but on the border prepared to go into Iraq for combat duty?
EDWARDS: But I want to be really clear about something, Tim. I'm saying something very different than what Senator Clinton's saying. Senator Clinton has said she will maintain troops inside Iraq, and that they will engage in combat operation, combat missions, I think is her term, inside Iraq. I will not do that. To me, that is a continuation of the war, and this war needs to be brought to an end. I do think that America, like we would anywhere else in the world, is focused on al-Qaeda, focused on public enemy number one, and we have to be ready to respond if they're planning attacks inside Iraq, attacks against us or our embassy inside Iraq, or attacks outside of Iraq. We have to be prepared to respond to that, and that's why I'd keep a quick reaction force in Kuwait. But I would not, as Senator Clinton would, keep combat troops inside Iraq and continue combat missions in Iraq.
I want to be able to say next fall, when I'm the Democratic nominee, and I'm standing with the Republican candidate, that Americans have a very clear choice. They can choose a Republican who wants to continue the war or a Democrat who wants to end the war. We can't just be a little bit better than them. We have to be very clear that voters have choices in this election.
RUSSERT: And Senator, your evolution on the war in Iraq is quite extraordinary. You were an original co-sponsor back in October of 2002, voting for the war. When you were running for vice president, October of 2004, even though we had not found weapons of mass destruction, you still said your vote was the right course to pursue. And in February of this year, you were on MEET THE PRESS, I asked you if you would cut off funding for the war in Iraq, and you said no. You now are in favor of cutting off funding, aren't you?
EDWARDS: No, sir. No. I'm saying the same thing now I said in February. What I have said all throughout the course of this campaign is what we need to do and what the Congress needs to do is they need to force George Bush's hand. I think the American people sent an absolutely clear mandate in November of 2006 that they expect the Congress to stand strong, to be firm. And the way for the Congress to do that is to ensure that every funding bill that goes to this president actually has a timetable for withdrawal. And if Bush vetoes that, they should send another bill for the timetable for withdrawal and they should stand their ground. There's a difference between doing that, Tim, and just cutting off funding for the troops.
RUSSERT: So you would not cut off funding, and if funding ran out because George Bush kept vetoing the funding measures, what would you do?
EDWARDS: If I were president, I would've already been bringing the troops out. If George Bush is still president, then he'll be in the position of either having to sign the legislation, which means he'll have to meet the timetable for withdrawal, or the money will dry up and he'll have to start withdrawing troops out of Iraq. Either way, the Congress has done exactly what the American people asked them to do in November of 2006, which is what they should do.
RUSSERT: There's been an interesting discussion about John Edwards. Here's how U.S. News & World Report wrote it, "The Evolution of John Edwards." And they say this:
Edward is–"Edwards has changed considerably from the happy-face centrist who refrained from attack politics in '04. His appeal today is based in large part on his sharp-edged anti war stand. ... This cycle, Edwards hopes to ride a wave of liberal anger and generalized dissatisfaction."
And then this from the Associated Press: "Analysis: Is Edwards Real or a Phony?"
"Edwards ... ran as a moderate Democrat for the Senate in 1998 and the White House in 2004, calling universal healthcare policies irresponsible," "impractical. Now he's more liberal, shifting to the left along with Internet-fed forces within the Democratic Party, and vows to give healthcare to all."
Have you shifted your views for political expediency, or has been there, has been there, has there been a profound, philosophical change within you?
EDWARDS: I'm exactly the same person that I was in 2004. I run for president for exactly the same reason. You know, I run for president, Tim, on behalf of the, my father, who worked in a mill all his life, the men and the women who worked in the mill with him, the men and women I grew up with who lost their jobs when that mill closed. Providing that kind of chance and opportunity to everybody is at the core of, is the core of why I'm running for president of the United States. That has never changed, and it is exactly the same today.
I do believe that there's been some changes both in America and in the world. The war in Iraq is much worse than it was in 2003 and 2004, and it's continued. Our healthcare situation is dysfunctional. It does not work. And I am convinced that the only solution to this is true, universal healthcare.
Global warming is now, by anybody's measure, a crisis. A crisis that America has to deal with and has to respond to. We have five million more people who've fallen into poverty while George Bush has been in office. And we're becoming a country made up of just a few rich people and everybody else. What I believe, and I believe it to my soul, is that these problems cannot be solved with small incremental change. They can't be solved with caution. We need big, bold ideas. We need a president who's willing to take on a system that stops those bold ideas from going into place and that's exactly what I intend to do as president.
RUSSERT: A new poll out in Des Moines today shows you second place to Hillary Clinton. But half the voters in Iowa believe that there may be a contradiction between your lifestyle and that it undermines your credibility. This is voters from Iowa saying this. One of the things that's been discussed is this: "Hedge Fund Ties Help Edwards Campaign." "Two years ago, former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, gearing up for his second run at the Democratic presidential nomination, gave a speech decrying the 'two different economies in the country: one for wealthy insiders and then one for everybody else.'
"Four months later, he began working for the kind of firm that to many Wall Street critics embodies the economy of wealthy insiders - a hedge fund. Edwards became a consultant for Fortress Investment Group. ..."
"It was an unusual choice of employment for Edwards, who for years has decried offshore tax shelters as part of his broader campaign to reduce inequality. While Fortress was incorporated in Delaware, its hedge funds were incorporated in the Cayman Islands, enabling its partners and foreign investors to defer or avoid paying U.S. taxes."
Why would you associate yourself with a hedge fund like that, when you're decrying the existence of two Americas?
EDWARDS: I think this is a perfectly fair question. And let me answer it. First of all, I was the first candidate, Democrat or Republican, to lay out an aggressive plan to get rid of the tax breaks that are available, including the offshoring that you just spoke about, that are available to hedge fund managers. They're not right, they're not fair, and they don't–are not available to ordinary Americans like the ones I spoke about just a few minutes ago.
Number two. If you look at what I have spent my life doing, including the time since the last election–which is exactly you're focused on right now–I did a whole variety of things. Number one, I ran a poverty center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which I started; I traveled the country, helping raise the minimum wage in six different states; I was personally involved in 20--with 23 unions in organizing campaigns, organizing thousands of workers into unions. My wife, Elizabeth, and I started a college-for-everyone program, for kids who are willing to work when they were in school to be able to go to college; I personally did humanitarian work in Africa.
These are the things that I spent my time doing, and I don't apologize for them. I'm proud of what I've spent my life doing. I–my whole life and the arc of my life has been about one single thing, which is to try to make sure that everybody in this country has the same kind of chance that and opportunity that I've had. And that's why I want to be president of the United States.
RUSSERT: But working for a hedge fund that has foreclosed on mortgages in Louisiana, is that the kind of image that you want to put forward in a presidential campaign?
EDWARDS: Well, when I–first of all, when I found out that there were foreclosures going on in Louisiana, in New Orleans, which is specifically what you're asking about, I responded immediately. Called the people at Fortress, told them that they needed to take action. I thereafter took any investments that I had in those–in that operation out. On top of that, we have started a fund, a home rescue fund, with a local community activist group in New Orleans to actually provide help to people who are having their homes foreclosed on in New Orleans. My point is really not complicated. If you look at where I have spent my time, and what my life has been about, instead of isolating one thing in a short period of time, it is very clear what my life has been about. I have spent my life fighting for the kind of people I grew up with, for the poor, for the disenfranchised, and I will do it as long as I'm living. I will do it when I'm president, and I will do it when I'm an ex-president.
RUSSERT: The exchanges between the Edwards campaign and the Clinton campaign have gotten quite pointed in recent days. I want to ask you about this one. "Edwards plays the Bubba card." "The official name of this campaign swing is 'economic fairness for the North Country,' but [Edwards campaign consultant David 'Mudcat' Saunders] ... and the boys call it 'let's help John Edwards screw those who screwed us tour,' Mudcat says. Us being rural America."
"And who would that be?"
"'Who screwed us?'" Saunders "asks, voice rising in incredulity. 'The Clintons screwed us.'"
How did the Clintons screw us?
EDWARDS: Well, Mudcat has, has a way of saying things that I wouldn't say exactly the way he does. What I would say is that the system in Washington where corporations, big corporations and their lobbyists have entirely too much influence, has resulted in rural Americans, ordinary Americans being left behind. And my view is that we have to have–we have to change that system to bring about the substantiative change for real people to have the opportunities that they need.
Now, I think the system's rigged. I don't think status quo works, and I think we have to be willing to take it on. And I've said repeatedly, and this is similar to what Mudcat just said, I believe we cannot replace a group of corporate Republicans with a group of corporate Democrats. We have to actually return the power in the government to ordinary Americans. And that–and the reason that matters is not in the abstract, you know. Lobbyists, the way the system works in Washington, that's all process. But the reason it matters is because it's–those things stand as an impediment to universal healthcare, to attacking global warming, to addressing economic inequality in this, in this country. It, it–they stand as an impediment to stopping the kind of private contracting of Blackwater that we've seen in, in Iraq. All that has to change in order for us to be able to help the very people that, that I'm talking about, and Mudcat's talking about.
RUSSERT: Let me ask you something else that Mudcat said, and ask you if it's your view. "The toxic coattails of Hillary Clinton could not only cost us an absolute certainty at the White House, but it also could cost us the U.S. House of Representatives. ... Not only do we lose the White House, but the collateral damage from Hillary Clinton at the top of the ticket could cost us Congress." Do you agree?
EDWARDS: Here's what I think. I am the candidate running for president on the Democratic side who's actually won an election in a red state running against the Jessie Helms political machine. I know what you have to do to win in battleground states, and to win in tough, tough congressional districts, and what you have to do to put out your message that works in those kind of places. People–I understand people who vote in those places, and they connect and relate to me. So I do believe when I am the Democratic nominee for president that there is no place in America that I can't go and campaign and help our congressional candidates and help our Senate candidates.
I think at the end of the day it's for voters to determine what impact Senator Clinton would have. But I think there are clear choices between the two of us. I've been elected in a red state, I believe that, at least based on the empirical data that's out there, indicates that I am the strongest candidate on the Democratic side in these battleground areas, in these battleground states. And I think that does matter for a very simple reason, because I am strongly in favor, as president, of pushing a, a progressive agenda. If we want big ideas, if we want to change the system, if we want the kind of things I've talked about universal healthcare, attacking global warming in a serious, serious way, dealing with income, all those things, if we want to do those things, we need to strengthen our numbers, the Democratic numbers, in the House and the Senate. And I am completely convinced that I can do that.
RUSSERT: But Senator, do you believe, like your top–one of your top advisers said, that Hillary Clinton would lose the presidency and very well lose the Congress for the Democrats?
EDWARDS: I honestly don't know the answer to that. I mean, I think there's a lot of conflict out there about that question. That's a question Senator Clinton should have to answer. I think voters are going to have to make that determination. But I think I–right now, that's an unknown.
RUSSERT: But other people, including your wife, Elizabeth, have made these kinds of suggestions. It's the elephant in the room. Let me read what Elizabeth said. "I do not"...
EDWARDS: Sure.
RUSSERT: ..."think the hatred against Hillary Clinton is justified. I don't know where it comes from. I don't begin to understand it. But you can't pretend it doesn't exist, and it will energize the Republican base. Their nominee won't energize them, Bush won't, but Hillary as the nominee will. It's hard for John to talk about, but it's the reality." Why is it hard for you to talk about?
EDWARDS: No, I think–what you just said is different from what you asked me just a minute ago. What you said about Elizabeth's statement I think is true. I hear a lot of those things when I'm out on the campaign trail. People–I, I don't want to ignore the first part of what she said. She's not saying it's fair, she's just saying that it is out there in America. And I hear the same things over and over and over. What I think is impossible to predict is how that plays itself out during the course of a presidential campaign.
I've lived through a presidential campaign. What I know is that voters have a very clear choice. Democratic voters have a very clear choice between Senator Clinton, with both all the good and bad that comes with her, and John Edwards, who has actually won in a red state and who can compete every single place in America. And we cannot lose this election. This is not about me, it's not about Senator Clinton. It doesn't matter what happens to us, personally. Our lives are going to be fine. The question is, what's going to happen to 47 million Americans who have no healthcare coverage. What's going to happen to women who are diagnosed with breast cancer like Elizabeth and have a 30 to 50 percent greater chance of dying because they have no healthcare coverage. What's going to happen to families who are sending their children to serve in Iraq and possibly die in Iraq.
We cannot lose this election. There is too much at stake. And I think it's important for Democratic primary voters to know simply that they have choices. I'm not saying anything bad about Senator Clinton. She's a good candidate. But there are clear choices between Senator Clinton and myself, and I want voters to know that.
RUSSERT: Senator Clinton and Senator Obama have both out raised you in terms of campaign finance and fund-raising. You have now opted for public financing. The DailyKos Web site has said this makes you a very dangerous candidate because between the time that primaries are over and the conventions start, you'll only have about $40 million to spend to ward off Republican attacks. That–and this is one of the reasons why you should not be the nominee, because you'd be in such a weakened position.
EDWARDS: Do you want me to respond?
RUSSERT: Please.
EDWARDS: I–this is going to be an election, Tim, it's not going to be an auction. You know, we're not going to determine who can raise the most money and thereby who should be president of the United States. It's an amazing thing to me that when you do something that you believe is right, same thing I did in 2003 and 2004, that this is the response. What I know is true, I know that when we get to after February 5 and it's pretty clear who the Democratic nominee for president's going to be, that there needs to be absolutely clear divisions between me as the Democratic nominee and the Republicans.
And I am completely convinced if I have, and I believe I will, beaten two celebrity candidates who will probably have spent over $200 million during the course of the nomination process, I can certainly beat a Republican who's carrying George Bush's baggage. And the way I will do it is not on the basis of money, but on the basis of what America needs, on the basis of principle stand, on the basis of big and bold ideas. I want people to see clear differences between me and them, them being the Republicans in this case. They will be awash in corporate money. You can take that to the bank. I will not.
RUSSERT: Senator John Edwards, as always, we thank you for your views and be safe on the campaign trail.
EDWARDS: Tim, thank you so much.

Remarks in Keene, New Hampshire

October 13, 2007

Thank you. Good to see all of you.
There's been a lot of talk up here in New Hampshire about change lately. But change is just a word when it's not backed up by real action. Anybody can say it. It's what you do that shows whether you really mean it.
To actually create change, we should start by telling the truth.
Here's the truth: the system in Washington is broken. Money is corrupting our democracy. Lobbyists and the special interests they represent are pouring millions of dollars into the system, and stopping the change we need dead in its tracks.
Our founding fathers intended our government to do the will of the people. But today, it's doing the will of the special interests instead.
The cynics say that it will always be this way. They say that the kind of big, bold change we need today can't be achieved, and we just shouldn't try.
But you can't listen to them. We've done it before, and we can do it again. Throughout our history, there have been times when good people have had to take the power back from the powerful interests. This is one of those times.
A century ago, the system was broken, too. Powerful business interests established control over the biggest sectors of the American economy. Men like Rockefeller and Carnegie colluded to control prices, eliminate competition, and manipulate the free market in the name of their own narrow interests.
Then as now, the American people knew the system was broken. And they had the same choice that we have today: accept it, or demand change.
We all know what happened. They demanded change, and elected a leader named Theodore Roosevelt to deliver it.
Because of Roosevelt's leadership, the coming decades were known as the вЂњAmerican Century,вЂќ and in it we built the biggest, strongest, most prosperous middle class in history.
Today, once again, powerful special interests have established control over our democracy. But what we face today is not a monopoly of control over our economy вЂ“ it is a monopoly of influence over our government.
We can fix this broken system, as generations before us fixed the problems they faced in their time. But we need a leader who won't accept the corruption in Washington. We need a leader strong enough to say вЂњNoвЂќ to money from lobbyists and special interests. We need a leader who will fight for the big change we need to see.
To clean up our government, you have to do two things. You have to be committed to changing the system. And you have to run a campaign that does not take money from lobbyists or special interests вЂ“ so you are not beholden to the people who are corrupting our system by the time you get to Washington.
You can't do one without the other. You have to do both. In this election, more than any other, the candidate who stands with the special interests will lose.
I have fought the special interests my entire life. As a lawyer, I defended hard-working Americans during the toughest times of their lives against the big corporations that were trying to victimize them.
As a United States Senator, I unseated a corrupt Republican incumbent in a red state вЂ“ because the voters knew that I would fight for them, and not the special interests.
Now, I am running for president to end the corrupt system in Washington, and return the power of this government back to the hard-working people of America.
And I am refusing to take money from lobbyists and special interests вЂ“ because if there's one thing I've learned out here on the campaign trail, it's that the American people are looking for more than just talk about change. They are looking for a leader who will back up their words with action.
The American people are sick and tired of business as usual. The status quo and the Washington establishment will not get us the change we need.
When I was in Congress, I saw what business as usual looked like. Sometimes it's blatant вЂ“ like the time current House Minority Leader John Boehner handed out checks from big tobacco companies to lawmakers on the floor of the House of Representatives. Or the time someone offered $100,000 to Congressman Nick Smith's son's campaign in exchange for a vote.
But usually, it's more subtle. The influence peddlers buy seats at the table where decisions are made. They explain their special needs to politicians, in their offices and at cocktail parties. And they surround them with hand-picked experts who will back up their case.
The problem is that one side of the argument usually has all the money and all the manpower. It's like a courtroom where only one side of the case is being argued.
If you want to see how the special interests get their way, just look at the universal health care bill that Senator Clinton tried to get passed in the 1990s. At first, the American people supported her proposal. But then the health insurance companies deployed armies of lobbyists to Capitol Hill to pressure lawmakers. They spent millions of dollars on television ads. And they won.
I believe Senator Clinton deserves credit for her effort. Her plan wasn't perfect, but it included a lot of good ideas. The place where she and I differ is the lessons we've learned since then.
She seems to think that you should still give lobbyists a seat at the table. I think if you give them a seat at the table, they'll eat all the food.
She seems to think you can talk about ending the influence of lobbyists, but still take millions of dollars from them. I believe that if you are serious about ending the influence of lobbyists, you have to stop taking their money.
When I challenged her on this, she responded by defending the system. I don't think you can talk about changing America, and then turn around and defend the broken system in Washington.
And I think if you are going to talk about ending the influence of special interests, you can't turn around and hold a fundraiser where you bring the special interests together with the very lawmakers they are trying to influence.
This is the poster child for what is wrong with politics today. Politicians try to have it both ways: they talk about changing the system, but then conduct business as usual.
The American people need a president who will be straight with them вЂ“ who will be honest about the greatest challenges our government faces. And one of the most important of those is the looming Social Security crisis. First, Senator Clinton said she would just wait for things to get better. Now, she has apparently told some people that she really supports my idea of asking people who make more than $200,000 a year to contribute a little more.
I don't believe open government means popular answers in public and honest candor in private.
Part of the reason the system is broken is that the special interests are winning many fights behind the scenes, before the American people ever hear about them.
Just a few days ago, the hedge fund industry won a behind-the-scenes war to kill a bill that would have plugged a loophole that funnels billions of dollars into the pockets of some of the highest-paid people in America.
The hedge fund industry hired more than 20 lobbying firms вЂ“ corporate Republicans and corporate Democrats. At the same time, they stepped up their campaign contributions, to remind politicians what they would be missing if they didn't play along.
Of course, Congress dropped the bill, and left the loophole wide open. This happens all the time in Washington. Measures that lobbyists oppose just fall off the schedule.
Look at the debate over global warming. Earlier this year, over 2,000 of the world's top client scientists released a report that concluded with at least 90 percent certainty that global warming is happening, and that man-made greenhouse gases are a major cause.
This is the same group that is sharing the Nobel Prize with Vice President Al Gore. But the facts in their report were not the facts that the big oil companies wanted to hear. So a conservative think tank funded by ExxonMobil offered scientists $10,000, plus travel and other expenses, to undermine the facts in the report to politicians on Capitol Hill. It was no wonder that the energy bill that passed Congress did not include a cap on greenhouse gas emissions.
Are you seeing a pattern here? The American people want change. But the special interests see change as a threat to their profits. So they hire lobbyists, step up their campaign contributions вЂ“ and block the change that people want. In Washington, that's the way the game is played.
*****
Well, I say it's time we end this game. This government belongs to the American people. It's time we put the power back in their hands. That is why today, I am proposing the One Democracy Initiative, to end the power of the special interests, restore our democracy, and start building One America.
The first thing we have to do is cut off special interests' ability to influence campaigns with their money, and increase the power of regular people.
Right now, any individual can donate up to $2,300 to a campaign. That means candidates are spending their time glad-handing with the tiny fraction of Americans who can write a $2,300 check. As president, I would rewrite the rules to put small donors in charge by matching the first $100 of donations at a rate of 8-to-1. Under my plan, two $100 checks will be worth the same as one $1,000 check вЂ“ and no one will be allowed to give more than $1,000.
But I will not stop there. With all the money that is flooding into this race, you would think it was an auction, not an election. I have decided to take public financing вЂ“ which will help my campaign raise money from small donors, and make a statement about my independence from big donors.
This is another place where Senator Clinton and I part ways. We have both said we support the public financing of campaigns as the best way to get special interest money out of our elections. I have backed up my words with actions, and challenged her to do the same.
She hasn't yet, but I hope she will. If she is not going to take public financing, I believe the American people deserve to know why she says she believes in the public financing system, but will not participate in it.
Unlike Senator Clinton, I have also never taken a dime from federal lobbyists or political action committees, because I know that money comes with strings attached. I think that should be the rule, not the exception. As president, I will prohibit all candidates and federal office holders from accepting contributions from lobbyists.
All this money is making it extremely difficult for non-wealthy candidates to run. I believe that a high-school teacher here in Keene, or a nurse in Manchester, should have the same opportunity to run for Congress as a lawyer from North Carolina. I believe everyone should have the same chance to run for office as I had.
But today, the cost of even a congressional campaign is climbing into the millions. Unfortunately, our broken system helps create the perception that to run for office, you either need to be very wealthy or willing to be very bought by the special interests.
As president, I will fix this by creating a public financing option for Congressional candidates that would give all candidates equal budgets and equal airtime. That way, regular Americans just like the people in this room can run for office without having to cozy up to big contributors.
*****
We also need to restore confidence in our democracy. In America, everyone's vote should count the same. But after the vote-counting fiascoes of recent years, we need to reassure people that their vote will be counted correctly. As president, I will require that all voting machines, including electronic ones, use paper ballots that can be verified by voters.
We also need to make sure that all of our citizens are able to participate in our democracy, and have the representation they deserve. We need to end the disenfranchisement of residents of Washington, D.C., and give D.C. residents a vote in Congress. We also need to end the disenfranchisement of former prisoners who have served their time. And we need to end the voter suppression and intimidation that has been reported in recent elections.
I believe in the wisdom of the American people, and I think the more power they have in our democracy, the better our country will be. That's why every two years, I will ask one million citizens to come together to tackle our toughest issues in local forums across the nation.
These Citizen Congresses will combine old-fashioned town halls with 21st century technology. They will give regular Americans a chance to speak to each other, and to their elected officials in Washington, without the filters of interest groups and the media.
Like so much of what Washington needs, this idea of grassroots democracy is already working out in the real world, in towns just like this one.
Right here in New Hampshire, the Portsmouth Study Circle has brought hundreds of regular people together for over a decade to work out issues вЂ“ from school redistricting to ending racial profiling to the city's 10-year plan. And the November 5th Coalition is working to raise awareness of local democracy and promote a new generation of citizen-centered work.
*****
That is the promise of our democracy: that everyday, hard-working Americans and their families can come together and exercise their democratic power to change this country for the better.
But to give them that power, we need to do more than just clean up our elections. We also need to break the link between K Street and Capitol Hill.
The bread and butter of wealthy lobbyists are earmarks вЂ“ taking money from the U.S. Treasury and sending it directly to their clients through spending bills. Top lobbyists earn millions this way. I will end that practice with a constitutional version of the line-item veto, where the president can require an up or down vote on any spending item he deems irresponsible or inappropriate
We also need to close the revolving door between Capitol Hill and K Street. I will reinstate the five-year ban on lobbying by former top government officials. President Bill Clinton passed that ban, but then he cancelled it in his last days in office. I will reenact it by statute so no president can rescind it again.
We also need to bar federal lobbyists from setting policy over their former industries. When I'm president, there will be no more foxes guarding the henhouse. If you want to see whether another candidate really stands for change, ask them whether they will do the same.
*****
The way Washington is rushing to do the bidding of special interests these days, you would think that they were the ones that made America great. But they're not. The hard-working men and women of America, like the people in this room, are the ones who made this country great.
I've talked a lot about what I will do as president to fix the broken system in Washington. But you all have a role to play in this, too.
The status quo will only continue if you let it. It will continue if you look the other way while people defend a system we all know is broken. It will continue if you settle for replacing a bunch of corporate Republicans with a bunch of corporate Democrats.
The status quo will continue if you let it вЂ“ but it will change if you demand it.
That is why I am challenging you today: be vigilant. Remember that democracy does not defend itself. Every generation has to fight to fulfill the promise of America вЂ“ of a nation where everyone is equal, and the government responds to the will of the people.
We are the great nation we are today because the generations that went before us stood up and fixed our democracy when it was broken. Today, that responsibility falls on all of us.
My youngest daughter, Emma Claire, is 9 years old. Many of you may have children or grandchildren around that age.
If we join together, starting today, and demand change, think about how different this country could be by the time they are out of high school.
We could be living in an America where every man, woman and child is guaranteed high-quality health care.
An America where we are finally working to halt global warming, develop clean fuels and end our addiction to foreign oil. An America on the road to ending poverty, with the American dream becoming a new reality for millions of hard-working Americans. An America where we have restored our moral leadership in the world.
But to reach that America tomorrow, we need to rise to the challenges we face today. No matter what the cynics say, if we join together and fight for real change, we can restore our democracy, and make our government work again.
So don't settle for more of the same. Don't settle for a broken system that ignores your cries for change.
Demand better. Let's be the generation that restores our democracy. Let's be the generation that returns the power of our government back to the people. Let's be the generation that restores our nation to greatness. Let's be the change we want to see.
This is our government. This is our America. And this is our moment to take it back. Stand with me today. And together, we can change this country.
Thank you, and God bless.

Remarks in Des Moines, Iowa: "Renewing the Social Compact"

October 26, 2007

Thank you, Doug, for that generous introduction. It's good to be here in Iowa with all of you today. And it's such an honor to be introduced by you.
We all need role models, and Doug is one in my book. I think role models are people who wake up every morning, work hard and do the right thing to build a better life for themselves and their family.
That's what Doug has done, and that's what lots of hard-working men and women here in Des Moines and all across this country do every day. In America, that should be enough to get ahead. But today, it's barely enough to squeak by.
That is not the way it's supposed to be. I know, because I've experienced the way it is supposed to be in my own life.
I was born in a small town in South Carolina. When I was born, my parents had to borrow $50 to take me home from the hospital. But when I was growing up, they taught me that if I worked hard and played by the rules, I could be anything I wanted to be. I went to good public schools, where I had teachers who helped me learn to believe in myself. Then I had the chance to go to college, and that has made all the difference in my life.
This didn't happen by accident. It happened because in America, there is a grand social compact вЂ“ anyone who is willing to work hard and do the right thing should have the opportunity to share in our nation's prosperity. In good times, a rising tide will lift all boats; in tough times, it's all hands on deck to set things right.
Over the course of our history, every generation of Americans has helped to expand the reach of that compact, moving us ever closer to the America of our ideals, where opportunity is truly shared by all. But now, instead of expanding further, our social compact is falling apart.
The statistics say our economy is growing, that the economic tide is rising. But if you look around, only the yachts are rising with it. Everyone else is taking on water. Profits are skyrocketing on Wall Street, but Main Street is drowning under waves of cost and debt.
The truth is our economy is only growing at the top. Forty percent of the economic growth over the past 20 years has gone to the top one percent of American families. Middle-class incomes have stagnated for the past seven years. Families are working longer hours, but finding it harder to get by. And for the 37 million Americans living in poverty, things are only getting worse.
But not everyone is struggling. In corporate America, where a broader sense of social responsibility once held sway, a culture of greed has taken over. Instead of treating their employees fairly, being accountable to their shareholders and contributing to America's prosperity, CEOs are acting like their corporations exist primarily to build their own massive fortunes.
In 1960, the average CEO made 41 times what the average worker made. But in 2005, the average CEO made over 400 times the average worker salary. The share of corporate profits going to CEO pay has doubled since the 1990s. Meanwhile, the value of the minimum wage has plummeted 30 percent since 1979.
What does Washington do while corporate profits climb and the wealth of the very wealthiest grows вЂ“ all at the expense of the vast majority of hardworking Americans? It circles the wagons around the people who are already doing the best. Instead of protecting the compact of equal opportunity and shared prosperity, Washington protects corporate profits and hoards prosperity.
That is wrong, it is shameful, and it is bad for our economy to boot. As Franklin Roosevelt said, вЂњWe have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals. We know now that it is bad economics.вЂќ
Unfortunately, this is no accident. Today, our economy is designed to benefit the wealthy and the powerful because it has been manipulated by the wealthy and the powerful.
The system in Washington is badly broken. It used to be that big business hired lobbyists and lawyers to help them get around the rules. That was bad enough вЂ“ but today, they hire them to write the rules. And it works, because the politicians who are supposed to make the rules are indebted to the lobbyists that the corporations hire.
The folks at the top tell us that this is how it's supposed to be in the global economy. They tell us that we should accept the fact that we're losing millions of jobs overseas because it'll make us more efficient. They tell us not to worry that middle-class wages are stagnating while corporate profits soar, because those profits will be reinvested. And they tell us not to be concerned that plants like the on in Newton that Doug worked for are closing, because it's just a reallocation of resources.
You don't need a business degree to know that these things hurt the middle class. And America cannot be getting stronger if its middle class is getting weaker.
Enough is enough. We don't need any more doubletalk. We need straight talk. We don't need any more empty promises. We need to restore one promise вЂ“ the promise of America, and the social compact that built the greatest economy in the world.
Corporations and powerful interests have run roughshod over regular middle-class families here in Iowa and all across America because that social compact has broken down.
As globalization, technology and demographic change have transformed our economy, corporations have adapted to protect their own interests. But Washington has not adapted the social compact to protect the interests of the middle class. Today, we are living in a 21st century economy, but asking our workers to compete with a 20th century set of tools.
We can fix this. We can restore the social compact, just as generations before us have restored it in their time.
But to do that, we have to do two things. First, we need to modernize the compact in the face of today's new economic realities. Instead of relying on a single employer to provide for its workers for life, we need universal health care and universal retirement savings accounts that follow workers from job to job.
Second, to restore the balance of power to the compact, we need to hold corporations accountable for serving the interests of workers and customers, not just corporate insiders, with stronger corporate responsibility laws and consumer protections.
*****
Updating the social compact with the middle class starts with recognizing that times have changed. We are never going back to the 1950s вЂ“ we need a new social compact that works in the 21st century.
The first thing we need to do is to make affordable, high-quality health care a part of that compact. This should have been done sixty years ago, when Harry Truman tried to enact universal health care. He was blocked by short-sighted special interests then, just as Senator Clinton was blocked by special interests when she tried to enact her health care plan in 1993.
I say it's time we stood up to those lobbyists and the special interests they work for. Forty-seven million Americans without health insurance is an abomination, and it needs to end. As president, universal health care will be my number one domestic priority.
We also need to adapt the compact to the new, short-term nature of the modern work environment by providing Americans with pensions they can take with them from job to job.
In the past, it was common for someone to stay with the same company for their entire career. And so it made sense for pensions to be connected to employers. Today, the average worker will probably hold jobs with multiple companies throughout the course of his or her career. So if you depend on your employer for retirement security, you're just one layoff away from a crisis.
As president, I will create a new universal retirement account requiring every business to automatically enroll its workers in at least one plan: a traditional pension, a 401(k), or an IRA. Workers will be able to choose to have their contributions deducted automatically from their paychecks, and they will be able to carry these accounts with them from job to job.
I will also help families save for retirement by creating new вЂњGet AheadвЂќ credits that will match, dollar-for-dollar, up to $500 in savings a year. These credits will double what families are able to put away each year.
We also need to ensure that corporations honor the pension promises they've made to workers. We can't allow fundamentally healthy companies to go into bankruptcy just to avoid keeping their promises to employees, or to emerge from bankruptcy with millions for executives and nothing for workers. As president, I'll give workers a claim for lost pensions, just like lost wages.
*****
To make sure that this compact stays intact, we need to fix the balance of power between big corporations and the American people. The American people created corporations to increase our shared prosperity as a nation. But from the way things are going today, you'd think that the American people were created to serve corporations.
Restoring the balance of power starts with restoring democracy in the workplace.
History has taught us that the best way to fix the unfair treatment of American workers is to strengthen organized labor. Throughout the last century, unions helped build America's strong middle-class. But today, the right to organize is being routinely ignored by businesses who know they will face little or no penalty for doing so.
I believe that if a person can join the Republican or Democratic Party simply by signing his or her name to a card, then any worker in America ought to be able to join a union just as easily.
Restoring the balance of power also means reigning in the culture of corporate greed.
The crisis in corporate governance today is being driven by abuse from insiders. But it has not always been this way. American companies used to have a strong sense of obligation both to their workers and to America's well-being. Henry Ford knew that his company would prosper only if his own workers earned enough to actually buy the Fords they produced.
Of course, there are still some good CEOs out there, one of whom is my great friend and very long-time supporter Jim Sinegal, the founder and CEO of Costco.
Jim was asked why Costco offers better wages and benefits than all of its rivals вЂ“ especially its most direct competitor, Wal-Mart. He said simply, вЂњYou get what you pay for. If you hire good people, pay them good wages and provide good jobs and careers, good things will happen in your business.вЂќ
We need more people like Jim in corporate America today. Because the success of our own economy, as well as our leadership in the global economy, demands that we uphold the values our country stands for: fair rewards for work, sound business and environmental practices, and fairness to all stakeholders.
Whether it's the workers on the factory floor, service workers in a hospital, or people around the globe looking to America as an example, hard-working people everywhere should see that America's corporate culture reflects the core values that our nation was built upon. They should see that America is about creating long-term, sustainable economic value that its citizens can depend on. Because if we can be an example for the world, we can leverage our strength in the global marketplace to ensure fairness and prosperity not just here at home, but in trading nations everywhere.
To start reforming America's corporate culture, we should increase transparency so that the public can see what corporations are doing. As president, I will enact a new law requiring all businesses to disclose a wealth of new and important information in annual reports to their shareholders, the appropriate government regulator, and to the public. I will also give shareholders new rights and responsibilities so that they can call shareholder meetings, remove directors who are doing bad jobs, and have a say on executive pay.
Today, too many companies in America are putting far too much of their earnings into excessive CEO and executive pay, when this money could be going to increased worker salaries, better benefits, and investments in plant and equipment. As president, I will immediately cap untaxed deferred compensation for executives and strengthen shareholder rights to rein in excessive pay.
And decades of de-regulation in Washington have weakened consumer protection laws, leaving Americans vulnerable to malfeasance and abuse by corporations, banks, and lenders.
Responsible regulation is good for American business, the American economy and American families. As president, I will make sure that the things we bring into our homes won't harm our families, by ensuring the safety of imported food and drugs, strengthening toy and other product safety and protecting families from toxic chemicals.
*****
The cynics would have you believe that none of what I've talked about here today is possible. They'd say we can't have leaders who will be straight with you anymore. They'd say that an economy based on shared prosperity has gone the way of the Model T.
Well, I'm here to tell you they're wrong. Our nation has gotten off track before. But every time that has happened, the American people stood up and demanded that it be fixed. They demanded that our leaders make the right decisions. And if their leaders didn't, they elected ones who would.
In America today, we need action measured by conviction, not just words. In this election, you face a choice between honest leadership and say anything politics, between conviction and calculation, between strength and compromise.
Let me tell you something: it takes strength to say вЂњnoвЂќ to the lobbyists and special interests вЂ“ it's much easier to just go along to get along. But I will never compromise my principles for the sake of politics. I've been saying вЂњno dealвЂќ to the big corporations, the special interests, and the lobbyists who work for them my entire life.
John F. Kennedy once said, вЂњThe heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.вЂќ
Isn't that the America we want? I believe it is. And we can have it, because throughout our history, one constant has remained: if the American people stand together, if we fight together and if we vote together, we can change this country.
Because no matter how corrupt Washington gets, it cannot change the fact that the strength of this country does not lie with the politicians in Washington. It does not lie with the lobbyists on K Street, or the special interests they work for. It lies with all of you.
We can change this country. Our time is now. So stand with me today. And together, let's fix this country.
Thank you. God bless you.

Remarks at St. Anselm's College in Manchester, New Hampshire: "The Moral Test of Our Generation"

October 29, 2007

Many of you know that I am the son of a mill worker -- that I rose from modest means and have been blessed in so many ways in life. Elizabeth and I have so much to be grateful for.
And all of you know about some of the challenges we have faced in my family. But there came a time, a few months ago, when Elizabeth and I had to decide, in the quiet of a hospital room, after many hours of tests and getting pretty bad news -- what we were going to do with our lives.
And we made our decision. That we were not going to go quietly into the night -- that we were going to stand and fight for what we believe in.
As Elizabeth and I have campaigned across America, I've come to a better understanding of what that decision really meant -- and why we made it.
Earlier this year, I spoke at Riverside Church in New York, where, forty years ago, Martin Luther King gave a historic speech. I talked about that speech then, and I want to talk about it today. Dr. King was tormented by the way he had kept silent for two years about the Vietnam War.
He was told that if he spoke out he would hurt the civil rights movement and all that he had worked for -- but he could not take it any more -- instead of decrying the silence of others -- he spoke the truth about himself.
"Over the past two years" he said, "I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silence and speak from the burning of my own heart."
I am not holier than thou. I am not perfect by any means. But there are events in life that you learn from, and which remind you what this is really all about. Maybe I have been freed from the system and the fear that holds back politicians because I have learned there are much more important things in life than winning elections at the cost of selling your soul.
Especially right now, when our country requires so much more of us, and needs to hear the truth from its leaders.
And, although I have spent my entire life taking on the big powerful interests and winning -- which is why I have never taken a dime from Washington lobbyists or political action committees -- I too have been guilty of my own silence -- but no more.
It's time to tell the truth. And the truth is the system in Washington is corrupt. It is rigged by the powerful special interests to benefit they very few at the expense of the many. And as a result, the American people have lost faith in our broken system in Washington, and believe it no longer works for ordinary Americans. They're right.
As I look across the political landscape of both parties today -- what I see are politicians too afraid to tell the truth -- good people caught in a bad system that overwhelms their good intentions and requires them to chase millions of dollars in campaign contributions in order to perpetuate their careers and continue their climb to higher office.
This presidential campaign is a perfect example of how our politics is awash with money. I have raised more money up to this point than any Democratic candidate raised last time in the presidential campaign -- $30 million. And, I did it without taking a dime from any Washington lobbyist or any special interest PAC.
I saw the chase for campaign money at any cost by the frontrunner in this race -- and I did not join it -- because the cost to our nation and our children is not worth the hollow victory of any candidate. Being called president while powerful interests really run things is not the same as being free to lead this nation as president of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. If protecting the current established structure in Washington is in your interest, then I am not your candidate. I ran for president four years ago -- yes, in part out of personal ambition -- but also with a deep desire to stand for working people like my father and mother -- who no matter how hard things were for our family, always worked even harder to make things better for us.
But the more Elizabeth and I campaigned this year, the more we talked to the American people, the more we met people just like my father, and hard working people like James Lowe. James is a decent and honest man who had to live for 50 years with no voice in the richest country in the world because he didn't have health care. The more people like him that I met, the more I realized something much bigger was stirring in the American people. And it has stirred in each of us for far too long.
Last month Ken Burns -- who made the great Civil War documentary -- launched his newest epic on World War II on PBS -- and what a story it tells.
At the cost of great suffering, blood and enormous sacrifice, within four years after Pearl Harbor it is incredible what this nation achieved. America built the arsenal of democracy worthy of our great history. We launched the greatest invasion armada in the history of warfare against Hitler's fortress Europe, and, with our allies, we freed a continent of suffering humanity.
At the same time on the other side of the globe we crossed 10,000 miles of ocean and liberated another hemisphere of humanity -- islands and nations freed from the grip of Japanese militarists. While at the same time succeeding in the greatest scientific endeavor ever undertaken -- the Manhattan project -- and topped it off with building the Pentagon, one of the largest buildings in the world in a little over a year.
It is incredible what America has accomplished. Because no matter what extraordinary challenges we have been faced with, we did exactly what America has always done in our history -- we rose to the challenge.
And, now, as I travel across America and listen to people, I hear real concern about what's going on. For the first time in our nation's history, people are worried that we're going to be the first generation of Americans not to pass on a better life to our children.
And it's not the fault of the American people. The American people have not changed. The American people are still the strong, courageous people they have always been. The problem is what our government has become. And, it is up to us to do something about it.
Because Washington may not see it, but we are facing a moral crisis as great as any that has ever challenged us. And, it is this test -- this moral test -- that I have come to understand is at the heart of this campaign.
Just look at what has happened in Iraq. What was the response of the American people to the challenge at hand? Our men and women in uniform have been heroes. They've done everything that's been asked of them and more. But what about our government? Four years after invading Iraq, we cannot even keep the lights on in Baghdad.
When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, the American people were at their best. They donated their time and their money in record numbers. There was an outpouring of support. I took 700 college kids down to help -- young people who gave up their spring break. But what about our government? Three years after hurricane Katrina thousands of our fellow Americans, our brothers and sisters, are still housed in trailers waiting to go home.
There's no better example of the bravery and goodness of the American people than the response to the attacks of 9/11: firefighters and first responders risking and too often giving their lives to save others, charging up the stairs while everyone else was coming down; record bloodbank donations; and the list goes on. But what about our government? Six years after 9/11, at Ground Zero there sits only a black hole that tortures our conscience and scars our hearts.
In every instance we see an American people who are good, decent, compassionate and undeterred. And, American people who are better than the government that is supposed to serve and represent them.
And what has happened to the American "can do" spirit? I will tell you what has happened: all of this is the result of the bitter poisoned fruit of corruption and the bankruptcy of our political leadership.
It is not an accident that the government of the United States cannot function on behalf of its people, because it is no longer our people's government -- and we the people know it.
This corruption did not begin yesterday -- and it did not even begin with George Bush -- it has been building for decades -- until it now threatens literally the life of our democracy.
While the American people personally rose to the occasion with an enormous outpouring of support and donations to both the victims of Katrina and 9/11 -- we all saw our government's neglect. And we saw greed and incompetence at work. Out of more than 700 contracts valued at $500,000 or greater, at least half were given without full competition or, according to news sources, with vague or open ended terms, and many of these contracts went to companies with deep political connections such as a subsidiary of Haliburton, Bechtel Corp., and AshBritt Inc.
And in Iraq -- while our nation's brave sons and daughters put their lives on the line for our country -- we now have mercenaries under their own law while their bosses sit at home raking in millions.
We have squandered millions on building Olympic size swimming pools and buildings that have never been used. We have weapons and ammunition unaccounted for that may now be being used against our own soldiers. We literally have billions wasted or misspent -- while our troops and their families continue to sacrifice. And the politically connected lobby for more. What's their great sacrifice -- higher profits.
It goes on every minute of every day.
Corporate executives at United Airlines and US Airways receive millions in compensation for taking their companies into bankruptcy, while their employees are forced to take cuts in pay.
Companies like Wal-Mart lobby against inspecting containers entering our nation's ports, even though expert after expert agrees that the likeliest way for a dirty bomb to enter the United States is through a container, because they believe their profits are more important than our safety. What has become of America when America's largest company lobbies against protecting America?
Trade deals cost of millions of jobs. What do we get in return? Millions of dangerous Chinese toys in our children's cribs laden with lead. This is the price we are made to pay when trade agreements are decided based on how much they pad the profits for multinational corporations instead of what is best for America's workers or the safety of America's consumers.
We have even gotten to the point where our children's safety is potentially at risk because nearly half of the apple juice consumed by our children comes from apples grown in China. And Americans are kept in the dark because the corporate lobbyists have pushed back country of origin labeling laws again and again.
This is not the America I believe in.
The hubris of greed knows no bounds. Days after the homeland security bill passed, staffers from the homeland security department resigned and became homeland security consultants trying to cash in. And, where was the outrage? There was none, because that's how it works in Washington now. It is not a Republican revolving door or a Democratic revolving door -- it is just the way it's done.
Someone called it a government reconnaissance mission to figure out how to get rich when you leave the government.
Recently, I was dismayed to see headlines in the Wall Street Journal stating that Senate Democrats were backing down to lobbyists for hedge funds who have opposed efforts to make millionaire and billionaire hedge fund managers pay the same tax rate as every hard-working American. Now, tax loopholes the wealthy hedge fund managers do not need or deserve are not going to be closed, all because Democrats -- our party -- wanted their campaign money.
And a few weeks ago, around the sixth anniversary of 9/11, a leading presidential candidate held a fundraiser that was billed as a Homeland Security themed event in Washington, D.C. targeted to homeland security lobbyists and contractors for $1,000 a plate. These lobbyists, for the price of a ticket, would get a special "treat" -- the opportunity to participate in small, hour long breakout sessions with key Democratic lawmakers, many of whom chair important sub committees of the homeland security committee. That presidential candidate was Senator Clinton.
Senator Clinton's road to the middle class takes a major detour right through the deep canyon of corporate lobbyists and the hidden bidding of K Street in Washington -- and history tells us that when that bus stops there it is the middle class that loses.
When I asked Hillary Clinton to join me in not taking money from Washington lobbyists -- she refused. Not only did she say that she would continue to take their money, she defended them.
Today Hillary Clinton has taken more money from Washington lobbyists than any candidate from either party -- more money than any Republican candidate.
She has taken more money from the defense industry than any other candidate from either party as well.
She took more money from Wall Street last quarter than Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, and Barack Obama combined.
The long slow slide of our democracy into the corporate abyss continues unabated regardless of party, regardless of the best interests of America.
We have a duty -- a duty to end this.
I believe you cannot be for change and take money from the lobbyists who prevent change. You cannot take on the entrenched interests in Washington if you choose to defend the broken system. It will not work. And I believe that, if Americans have a choice, and candidate who takes their money -- Democrat or Republican -- will lose this election.
For us to continue down this path all we have to do is suspend all that we believe in. As Democrats, we continue down this path only if we believe the party of the people is no more.
As Americans, we continue down this path only if we fail to heed Lincoln's warning to us all.
"At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected," he asked, "if it ever reaches us it must spring up amongst us. It can not come from abroad. If destruction be our lot -- we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we must live through all time or die by suicide."
America lives because 20 generations have honored the one moral commandment that makes us Americans.
To give our children a better future than we received.
I stand here today the son of Wallace and Bobbie Edwards. The father of Wade, Cate, Emma Claire and Jack -- and I know, as well as you, that we must not be the first generation that fails to live up to our moral challenge and keep the promise of America.
That would be an abomination.
There is a dream that is America. It is what makes us American. And I will not stand by while that dream is at risk.
I am not perfect -- far from it -- but I do understand that this is not a political issue -- it is the moral test of our generation.
Our nation's founders knew that this moment would come -- that at some point the power of greed and its influence over officials in our government might strain and threaten the very America they hoped would last as an ideal in the minds of all people, and as a beacon of hope for all time.
That is why they made the people sovereign. And this is why it is your responsibility to redeem the promise of America for our children and their future.
It will not be easy -- sacrifice will be required of us -- but it was never easy for our ancestors, and their sacrifices were far greater than any that will fall on our shoulders.
Yet, the responsibility is ours.
We, you and I, are the guardians of what America is and what it will be.
The choice is ours.
Down one path, we trade corporate Democrats for corporate Republicans; our cronies for their cronies; one political dynasty for another dynasty; and all we are left with is a Democratic version of the Republican corruption machine.
It is the easier path. It is the path of the status quo. But, it is a path that perpetuates a corrupt system that has not only failed to deliver the change the American people demand, but has divided America into two -- one America for the very greedy, and one America for everybody else.
And it is that divided America -- the direct result of this corrupt system -- which may very well lead to the suicide Lincoln warned us of -- the poison that continues to seep into our system while none notice.
Or we can choose a different path. The path that generations of Americans command us to take. And be the guardians that kept the faith.
I run for president for my father who worked in a mill his entire life and never got to go to college the way I did.
I run for president for all those who worked in that mill with my father.
I run for president for all those who lost their jobs when that mil was shut down.
I run for president for all the women who have come up to Elizabeth and me and told us the like Elizabeth they had breast cancer -- but unlike Elizabeth they did not have health care.
I run for president for twenty generations of Americans who made sure that their children had a better life than they did.
As Americans we are blessed -- for our ancestors are not dead, they occupy the corridors of our conscience. And, as long we keep the faith -- they live. And so too the America of idealism and hope that was their gift to us.
I carry the promise of America in my heart, where my parents placed it. Like them, like you, I believe in people, hard work, and the sacred obligation of each generation to the next.
This is our time now. It falls to use to redeem our democracy, reclaim our government and relight the promise of America for our children.
Let us blaze a new path together, grounded in the values from which America was forged, still reaching toward the greatness of our ideals. We can do it. We can cast aside the bankrupt ways of Washington and replace them with the timeless values of the American people. We can liberate our government from the shackles of corporate money that bind it to corporate will, and restore the voices of our people to its halls.
This is the cause of my life. This is the cause of our time. Join me. Together, we cannot fail.
We will keep faith with those who have gone before us, strong and proud in the knowledge that we too rose up to guard the promise of America in our day, and that, because we did, America's best days still lie ahead.

Remarks at the University of Iowa in Iowa City: "Learning the Lesson of Iraq - A New Strategy for Iran"

November 5, 2007

Thank you for having me here today. Thank you.
Five years ago, the Bush Administration went to war with Iraq, a war we all know now we did not need to fight. Today, we see the results of that fateful decision -- a civil war with no end in sight... a black hole in our budget... and nearly 4,000 brave men and women in our military who have paid the ultimate price.
A famous philosopher once observed that those who don't remember history are condemned to repeat it. Unfortunately, the war in Iraq isn't even history yet, but the Bush Administration is repeating the march to war with Iran -- and they're getting help from people who should know a lot better.
George Bush, Dick Cheney, and the neocon warmongers used 9/11 to start a war with Iraq and now they're trying to use Iraq to start a war with Iran. And we have to stop them. We owe our American heroes -- the men and women in our armed services who are fighting so bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan today -- no less. Many of our soldiers are the same age as some of you here today -- or even younger. We owe them and their families this solemn oath: we will make every national security decision as carefully and responsibly as is humanly possible.
This is a critical moment. As a nation, we stand today at a fork in the road with Iran. We have a real choice about the direction we'll take. One path will replay the last seven years. It leads toward a dark future of belligerence, aggression, and war.
We need a new direction -- one that will defuse the Iran threat, rather than aggravate it, one that will make America safer, not make the world more dangerous.
To understand exactly what the administration is trying to do with Iran, we need to go back to the beginning of the Bush Administration and look at how they took us to war with Iraq.
In the spring of 2002, the nation was struggling to recover from the devastating terrorist attacks of 9/11. At the same time, a group of Bush Administration neoconservatives, like Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz, were strategizing for ways to start a war with Iraq. And suddenly, instead of reacting to 9/11 by working to protect America from terrorists, they saw a political opportunity to promote their right-wing ideological agenda and demonize anyone who disagreed with them.
Here's what you have to know about these neocons -- they think might makes right, every time. They believe in domination, not debate. They think America should use our military power to impose our will wherever and whenever we want. They use a sledgehammer when we should use a scalpel.
And here's what you need to know about George Bush's foreign policy -- it's written by these neocons, lock, stock, and barrel.
So after 9/11, instead of focusing on the terrorist threat, George Bush started promoting a radical new neoconservative doctrine he called, quote, "preventive war" -- which would soon become part of his argument for war in Iraq.
Here's what they mean by preventive war -- if we see a possible threat, we go to war; we don't exhaust diplomatic, political, and economic options, we go straight to war. Under this Bush doctrine, military force is no longer the option of last resort.
By September of 2002, President Bush had included the new doctrine in his administration's National Security Strategy -- the document that guides our military in planning our defense. And then the next month, Congress voted to authorize the president to use force in Iraq. I was wrong to vote for this war. It was a mistake to give this president the authority to wage a reckless war in Iraq.
Now, I want to be very clear about something. I believe very strongly that any commander-in-chief must retain the right to respond with appropriate force when there's real intelligence about an imminent threat to America.
But there is a difference between doing everything in our power to keep America safe and a reckless, belligerent policy that actually makes us less safe. The preventive war doctrine was a stunning departure from the policy that had kept America safe during both world wars and during the Cold War. It is wrong on the merits, wrong on the morals, and wrong for America.
Harry Truman once said, "There is nothing more foolish than to think that war can be stopped by war. You don't 'prevent' anything other than peace."
That's exactly right. Think about it -- you don't prevent wars by starting them. It would be ridiculous if it weren't so dangerous.
This George Bush policy instead is, almost literally, "shoot first, ask questions later."
Armed with their preventive war doctrine, the administration used every excuse to march to war, when he should have taken every reasonable step to prevent war. And the war has backfired terribly. It damaged America's moral reputation, decreased our national security, and increased terrorism worldwide.
It will take years to repair the damage, and we must begin by ending the war in Iraq. It has now been exactly a year since the American people voted for a Democratic Congress that would end the war. Yet we still have the status quo.
When I am president, I will immediately withdraw 40-50,000 troops, launch a diplomatic offensive to invest all local, national, and regional parties in the comprehensive political solution that will end the violence, and will completely withdraw all combat troops within 9 to 10 months.
The bottom line is simple -- no combat troops; no combat missions; no combat, period. Not sometime to be determined, not by 2013. By the end of my first year as president, by the end of 2009.
I believe every candidate for president owes the American people a clear and specific plan for ending the Iraq War, and I have done my part. You deserve to know exactly where we stand. With less than 60 days to the caucus, Senator Clinton has still not given specific answers to specific questions. How many troops will she withdraw, and when will she withdraw them? All she's said is that she will meet with her generals within two months of taking office. That's not a plan. That's not even a real promise. It's the promise of a planning meeting.
What's more, Senator Clinton wants to keep combat troops in Iraq to perform combat missions in Iraq. She will extend the war. I will end the war. Only in Washington would anybody believe that you can end the war and continue combat. On a matter as serious as Iraq, we need honesty and real answers -- not more double-talk.
And all of this is occurring in a very dangerous context -- when we badly need leadership that will stand up to the president. The neocons are once again preparing for war. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently told reporters that the administration has prepared "contingency plans" for attacks. George Bush has been rolling out reckless rhetoric, saying that "World War III" is just around the corner with Iran. And just over a week ago, Bush and Cheney declared the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization and a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction.
We have seen this movie before. And it doesn't end well -- in fact, as we all know too well, in Iraq, it hasn't ended at all.
In order to declare the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization -- something we've never done before for a government-run militia -- Bush was supported by the Senate. Many in our party opposed this vote, like Senator Dodd and Senator Biden, and I applaud them for that. Unfortunately, some supported it. Senator Clinton once again sided with Bush and the neocons -- helping them rattle their sabers and build their case for another preventive war.
It's clear that Senator Clinton and I learned very different lessons from the run up to the Iraq war. I learned that if you give this president an inch, he will take a mile -- and launch a war. But Senator Clinton apparently learned a different lesson, and she's giving the administration exactly what it wants once again.
Senator Clinton is voting like a hawk in Washington, while talking like a dove in Iowa and New Hampshire. One of her advisors told the New York Times that was because she was shifting from primary mode to general election mode. Well, we only need one mode from our president -- tell the truth mode all the time.
So let me be clear.
We should take Iran very seriously. And as commander-in-chief, if I ever learn that any nation is threatening an imminent attack, I will do what's necessary to protect America.
But the one thing we absolutely should not be doing is launching another so-called "preventive war" with Iran. American and the world possess a powerful arsenal of diplomatic and economic options that have not yet been used, let alone exhausted.
We need to use all those tools to force President Ahmadinejad, the Ayatollah Khameini, and the mullahs to understand that their nuclear ambitions and their support of terrorism will put the Iran on a fast track to utter isolation.
We already know diplomacy can work with even the toughest foes. The few foreign policy successes of the Bush Administration have come through the diplomacy it derides. Both North Korea and Libya have given up their struggle for weapons of mass destruction. While we need to keep the pressure on to make sure these countries keep their promises, the progress so far shows what can be accomplished in Iran.
We need to increase the division between extremists and the Iranian population. Ahmadinejad is already unpopular in his country and has failed to meet his promises to reduce corruption and improve the economy.
This is a country that's ready for change.
Women in Tehran today put on clothing they want to wear under the burkhas and veils they are forced to wear. Iranians everywhere share a hunger for ideas and free expression, seen in Iran's thriving black market in great literature, new classics, and even western videos. And it is Iranians like many of you in this room -- young people, students -- who are leading the charge to undermine the stifling oppression of Ahmadinejad.
We need to let the people of Iran know that Ahmadinejad's extremism and pursuit of nuclear weapons will only hurt them and destroy their country's prospects for advancement.
We need, in short, a new strategy for Iran. My plan for Iran has five principles.
First and foremost, we need to ensure that the preventive war doctrine goes where it belongs -- the trash-heap of history. As he has done with so much else, Vice President Al Gore got it right about the preventive war doctrine. In 2002 -- the same year that George Bush introduced his preventive war doctrine -- Gore made a speech at the Commonwealth Club in California. He said, and I quote, "What this doctrine does is to destroy the goal of a world in which states consider themselves subject to law, particularly in the matter of standards for the use of violence against each other. That concept would be displaced by the notion that there is no law but the discretion of the President of the United States."
These are especially chilling words to read five years later -- after Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, and the president's refusal to condemn torture, and they are particularly relevant to the situation with Iran.
I believe every candidate owes it to the American people to be very clear about where he or she stands on this question. As commander-in-chief, my national security policy will be based on deterrent strength and always protecting Americans -- in short, the use of force as a last resort.
As a part of this strategy, I will ask my National Security Advisor to remove President Bush's explicit endorsement of a preventive war doctrine from my National Security Strategies. And I will ask our Joint Chiefs of Staff to form military plans in accordance with proven national security strategies that we know can keep us and our allies safe -- not discredited and dangerous ideological fancies.
This strategy will keep America and our allies safe -- while showing the world we are once again a strong country that can always win war, but that prefers peace over war. Most importantly, it will restore our legitimacy in the eyes of the world. Everyone knows we're powerful. The question is what we use our power for -- and whether the rest of the world will once again see us as a force for good, rather than the bully we've become under Bush.
The second principle is to use bolder and more targeted economic sanctions to force Iran's leaders to understand that they cannot continue to buck the will of the international community without destroying their ability to be the modern, advanced nation they so desperately want to become.
There are smart sanctions that will achieve results, and there are reckless sanctions that will backfire and play into a policy of military attacks. The Bush-Cheney sanctions Senator Clinton supports are the most radical, unprecedented, and belligerent sanctions possible. These reckless sanctions will escalate tensions between the U.S. and Iran -- the thing Bush and Cheney most want -- and have other unintended consequences, such as higher oil prices.
Instead, we should pursue smarter sanctions that will force Iran's leaders to realize that their pursuit of nuclear weapons will shut down their economy, further isolate them from the world community, and make them a rogue nation for generations.
We must fully enforce the Iran Sanctions Act, a law Congress passed to let the president punish companies who do business with Iran's extremist regime. We must work multilaterally -- most importantly, with our Western European allies -- to strengthen economic sanctions on Iran. And we should shut down Iranian access to the American financial system. The Bush Administration recently banned two Iranian banks from accessing our system. However, Iranians can still do business through third parties and through other banks. This must stop.
The third principle of my plan is to use "carrots" -- diplomatic measures to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions and re-join the world community. We should draw Iran into compliance through incentives including increased refinery capacity and a regional fuel bank that Iran could use for peaceful purposes.
And we need to use the possibility of bringing Iran into multilateral economic organizations, including the WTO, as a carrot for change.
The fourth principle of my policy is to reengage with Iran.
Even Republicans like Senator Hagel are now urging the president to open up communications with Iran. Communication is not a concession. After all, we talked to our great enemy, the Soviet Union, at the height of tensions during the Cold War.
We should begin building a new course of diplomatic relations with Iran by expanding low-level talks between government officials on both sides in a neutral country. The goal of these talks should be to find a path out of the log-jam created by the Bush Administration and, ultimately, to achieve full diplomatic relations between the two countries.
But we must always negotiate from a position of strength. Unlike President Bush, I believe we do need to meet with Iran. But any higher-level meeting should only happen if we verify that the meetings would promote America's national security interests and would not be used for propaganda or other improper purposes.
And the fifth and final principle is to reengage with other major nations on the challenge of Iran.
We must work with China and Russia on the problem of Iran's nuclear ambitions. Both nations have economic relationships with Iran on trade and energy. But both nations also have a strong interest in stability in the Middle East. And neither nation wants the nuclear club to expand. In the first year of my administration, I will convene a conference with my Secretary of State and representatives from the "E.U. 3" -- Great Britain, France, and Germany -- Russia, China and Iran, to discuss a way out of the stalemate of the Bush Administration.
The strategy I've described to you today is the right way to keep America strong while keeping the peace.
It is the right way to force Iran to forgo its nuclear ambitions.
And it is the right way to restore America's historic role as a leader of the world community -- through a combination of strength, vision, and reengagement with the world.
America needs a president who can guide America through a dangerous world, with the wisdom of history by our side.
America has gone through similar challenges before.
In his first inaugural speech, in 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt rejected the failed Republican policy of military intervention in Latin America and Europe. Instead, he told the nation, we should "dedicate this Nation to the policy of the Good Neighbor . . . the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors."
That's the America we should be.
This is the great vision of our great presidents. It is the vision of a nation of honor. It is the vision of a nation of everyday heroes, like the brave men and women fighting every day in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it is the vision that guides me as I seek to be your president.
But I need your help. We can only rebuild America if we rebuild it together.
Together, we can restore our values to Washington, and restore America's moral authority to the world. Thank you for being with me here today. God bless you and God bless America.

Veterans' Day Remarks at the State Historical Building in Des Moines, Iowa

November 11, 2007

We set aside a few days each year in honor of America and those ideals that make us Americans - independence, equality, thanks for the blessings of our inheritance. But this weekend one day stands apart - although it began that way, it no longer commemorates a specific event, it is not dedicated to any one individual - instead it honors the sacrifice of millions, across all the generations of America.
Since George Washington's Continental Army fought to create this nation, millions of men and women have put on America's uniform to defend, protect and carry the cause of freedom for all humanity. With valor and sacrifice, through hardship and peril, they have changed the course of history for our nation and the world. Let us begin today with a moment of silent prayer for all those who have served in our armed forces ever since there has been an idea and a place called America. For our veterans, join me in a prayer of thanks.
Thank you.
Veterans Day is a time to remember our men and women in uniform who have served and sacrificed and risked for our nation - and the too many, far too many who have lost life, blood, and limb so that we could live free, and enjoy our rights and liberties. As many of you know, Elizabeth comes from a military family - her father Vincent was a Navy pilot for more than 30 years - a real hero, who flew reconnaissance missions over China and North Korea and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. So we know personally how sacred this day is for all who have served and are serving today.
But this day is about more than remembering and honoring our veterans. It is a day to reflect on what it means to be American. To consider not just the sacrifices of those who serve in uniform, but what their sacrifices demand of each of us.
It is a day to look at the ideal of America and reflect on our own obligation and responsibility to keep that ideal alive. That our veterans have kept faith there can be no doubt. Today we must ask ourselves if we have done the same.
For twenty generations, Americans have kept the one moral commandment that makes us American - to pass a better future on to our children than we received.
My father had to borrow $50 to bring me home from the hospital. Home was a small house in the mill village owned by the mill where my father worked. I am here today because, like all the people my father worked with in the mill, my parents got up every day believing in the promise of America, and they worked hard - no matter what obstacles were thrown against them - to give me the chance for a better life.
But everywhere I travel today - in every corner of America - I hear uncertainty - a real concern that we could be the first generation of Americans that fails to leave our children a better future than our parents left us.
To be the first generation of Americans to fail that commandment would be an abomination.
This is the great moral test of our generation - to ensure that we give our children a better future than we inherited, just as our parents did for us.
It is not surprising people are worried that the promise of America is at risk - the warning signs are everywhere.
We see the gap between those at the very top and everyone else grow wider and wider every day.
Thirty-seven million Americans - citizens of the richest country on earth - still live in poverty.
Forty-seven million Americans live without health care.
Lobbyists and corporate power runs rampant in Washington, subverting our government to its own ends - NAFTA-style trade deals pad corporate profits but cost millions of American jobs; so-called prescription drug reform benefits drug companies, not patients; tax breaks and loopholes are showered on the very wealthiest while working Americans struggle to get by.
George Washington led the Continental Army that enabled the creation of our nation - his name symbolizes the greatness of America. And now, the city that bears his name symbolizes what is wrong with America.
Last century, we had a president who reminded us that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Now we have a president who says be afraid, be very afraid. He used fear to sell us a war we did not need to fight. He uses fear to trample over our civil liberties and deface the Bill of Rights.
But the blame for all of this does not lie only with President Bush. Too many politicians - at worst, without conviction, or at best, without courage - have stood by and let all of this happen.
Here's the hard truth. It's not just politicians. It's not just Republicans or Democrats or even just Washington. It's all of us. This is our democracy - if it is failing us, we have nowhere to look but to ourselves.
But here's another, greater truth - in America, true power does not lie in the arms of a deceitful president, cynical politicians, or calculating insiders, it lies with all of us.
This is our democracy - to reclaim it, we need only look to ourselves.
Of course, cleaning up Washington won't solve everything by itself - Washington is the problem that stops us from dealing with our problems. If we are going to meet the challenges we face and prevail over them, we must fix our broken system and we must think as big as the challenges we face. Our ideas must be bold enough to succeed and our government must be free to enact them without compromising principle or sacrificing results.
One without the other isn't good enough. All the big ideas in the world won't make a difference if they have to go through this broken system that remains controlled by big business and their lobbyists. And if we fix the system, but aren't honest with the American people about the scope of our challenges and what's required of each of us to meet them, then we'll be left with the baby steps and incremental measures that are Washington's poor excuse for progress.
But if we do both - if we have the courage to offer real change and the determination to change Washington - then we will meet the great moral test of our generation. We will leave our children a greater America - One America, where every man, woman and child is blessed with the same, great opportunity and held to the same, just rules.
Last night, I called on Iowans and Americans to join together and meet the moral test of our generation, which begins by reclaiming our democracy. Today, I am laying out my Plan to Build One America. Over the course of the last year, I have offered detailed, honest plans and specific, forthright proposals. But I don't want anyone in Iowa to have to take my word for it, so I've gone and put them all on paper. Over the next few weeks, we'll be delivering more than 100,000 copies of this book to Iowa caucus-goers. And if you want one, but don't get one, just let our campaign know.
Iowans have a right to know where I stand and what I'll do as president. You are the guardians of what kind of president we'll have, and whether America meets the great challenges we face. I'm not afraid to stand here and answer your tough questions and tell you where I stand.
Now, it's about 80 pages long, so IxE2x80x99m not going to read the whole thing, but here's the big picture. I believe there are four broad areas we must tackle.
First, we need to stand up for working and middle class families.
We need, as a nation, to invest in fighting poverty, strengthening workers right to organize, and smarter and safer trade, if we are to build a stronger and larger middle class.
We need to pass universal health care. Achieving universal health care will help everyone - by covering the 47 million Americans who lack health care - and bringing more choices, more security, lower costs, and better care to the rest of us. But it is only going to happen if we fight for it and share responsibility for getting there. Businesses and the government must sacrifice and pay their fair share.
The second thing we need to do restore America's moral leadership around the world, which starts with ending the war in Iraq. We need a new path to stop terrorism that brings nations together in a counter-terrorism alliance - we become stronger and safer, not weaker, when we work with the world. And, we need to stand up, together, and tell this Congress that we elected them to end the war in Iraq and bring our brave men and women home.
The third thing we need to do is to invest in a better future for our children.
We need to invest in improving our schools and making college affordable so that we can compete in the 21st century.
And we need to face what may be the great challenge of this generation: addressing global warming. For the sake of our national and domestic security, we need a historic shift in how we make and use energy. We need to cut our emissions of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by 2050. We may face higher energy bills as we make this transition. But the payoff is great - a cleaner, safer world and a new energy economy with more than a million new jobs.
Fourth, we need to create opportunity for all - the promise of America is a promise made to every American - black, white; gay, straight; healthy, sick; working, retired; rich, poor; born, bred, or just arrived. Every man, woman, and child in this country deserves the same, great chance. And I believe there is a sacred contract between our country and our veterans and armed forces. We have a moral obligation to take care of them and their families.
Those who fought to create this nation did not liberate this ground for freedom and democracy so that some two centuries later, on our watch, government of the people would become government of the corporate interests.
Those who gave their lives at Gettysburg and Antietam in the name of Union and equality did not die for a nation, on our watch, still divided by opportunity and justice.
Those who fell at Guadalcanal and at Normandy to save the world from tyranny did not perish to let corruption seep into our government slowly and persistently over decades almost unnoticed until, on our watch, it threatens the lifeblood of our democracy.
Those who fell in Vietnam - who did what their leaders asked of them long after those leaders knew it was a mistake - and whose valor, bravery and sacrifice was all the harder to bear because they suffered their wounds without the full support of the American people - did not fall so that, on our watch, we would tolerate leaders who once more would refuse to admit their mistakes, but instead press on with a war that should have ended a long time ago.
Those who died defending freedom and the rights of Americans for all time did not die so that, on our watch, we would let the president take those rights away. They did not die for a 21st century America where poverty is still endemic, one of every three African-American children has no health care, and one in four homeless people are veterans.
All those who have served our nation from Valley Forge to Baghdad have risked everything they have and everything they are - not so the torch that Americans pass from one generation to the next - the torch of a better America - might be dropped, but to keep it burning strong.
In their name, we must no longer turn our heads. We must no longer live in vague acknowledgment of the corruption and incompetence that threatens the promise of our children's future while saying to ourselves, the problem's just too big, there's nothing we can do about it.
I stand before you today to say - that is not good enough. There is something we can do. Our founders placed the ultimate power in our hands - ours alone. When we take its reins, it is irresistible. If someone tells you there is nothing we can do, you tell them the ghost of generations proves them wrong - there is nothing we cannot do.
It will not be easy, but we are Americans - we never take the easy way out. So hear this - it is a call to your conscience and your heart. A call not for me, but for them. For those who have served. For those who will. For our children, their children, and their children after them.
Let us stand up and give everything we have as all those before us have done.
In their name, let the world know that the fight for a greater America begins today. For universal health care, ending poverty, honoring our veterans, reclaiming our democracy, and ending the war in Iraq. For opportunity, equality, justice, and the idea of America.
This is the moral test of our generation. We can meet it. We will meet it. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

Interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' "Face the Nation"

November 18, 2007

SCHIEFFER: And good morning again.
Senator Edwards is in Los Angeles this morning. He really got an early wake-up call today.
Senator, thank you for coming in. Let's get right down to it. This debate in Las Vegas was one of the roughest yet. You went directly at Hillary Rodham Clinton, and she went right back at you. Here's what she said.
Senator HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I don't mind taking hits on my record, on issues, but when somebody starts throwing mud, at least we can hope that it's both accurate and not right out of the Republican playbook.
SCHIEFFER: So are you operating out of the Republican playbook, senator?
EDWARDS: I don't-good morning, Bob. I don't--I don't--I don't think so. What she was responding to was me telling the truth about some differences that we have on issues of war. I mean, I was talking about Iraq, what I want to do in Iraq, which is get all combat troops out and end combat missions--she has a different view about that--and differences we have about Iran. In fact, I believe we have to be very, very strong in stopping George Bush in his march to war with Iran, and she voted in a different way and voted with Bush on that issue. And I was just pointing out those differences, and I think she's completely entitled to take her position and defend her position, it's a--it's a presidential campaign. But the idea that this is mudslinging, I mean, we're talking about substantive issues of war that are going to affect the next president of the United States.
And I might--I might add, having been through a general election, I mean, if anybody, including Senator Clinton, thinks this is mudslinging, they got things--they--this is milquetoast compared to what we're going to see next fall.
SCHIEFFER: All right, well...
EDWARDS: We need to have--we need to have a candidate who's actually ready for that battle.
SCHIEFFER: Well, all right. Well, let me just ask you this, senator. Did you believe that Hillary Clinton shouldn't be elected president, or that she can't be elected president? Do you believe she is not electable?
EDWARDS: Oh, I wouldn't say either one of those things. I think that--I think that, first of all, Democratic voters are going to have real choices in this election. We have different approaches. I have a different approach to Washington. I think there're some real changes in--that need to be done in Washington with respect to the way the system operates, and what I see is some corruption of the system over time. She has a different view about that. As I just mentioned, she has different views about Iraq, Iran and some other issues. So we--I want to be certain that the voters know that they have very clear choices in this election, and in my case it's somebody that's going to fight for them, fight for working people and fight for that change.
Now, as to who can best be elected, what I...(network audio difficulties)...is I'm the candidate who's actually won in a red state. I grew up in a small town in rural America. So I think I can go anywhere in the country and campaign and compete. And I'll let Senator Clinton make the case for herself.
SCHIEFFER: You mentioned that she is a defender of a system that you have called "rigged" and "corrupt." Do you believe that she is corrupt?
EDWARDS: No. No, and I've never said that. I think that very good people get pulled into this system and get accustomed to it--and can I just say, on my own behalf, I myself have been guilty. I mean, there's no way I'm holier-than-thou about this. I've turned my head myself. And I think we've just now reached the stage that we can't continue to do it.
I mean, just in the last week, we saw that there was an effort made by the Congress to get cheaper generic drugs on the market more quickly to help people who were going to the pharmacy to buy their prescription drugs. And the drug companies and their lobbyists spent millions of dollars lobbying to Congress last year, I think almost $40 million, and they managed to kill it. And basically, what they killed was an effort to stop the bribing of generic companies by big drug companies. I mean, this is just one indication of a symptom of a much more pervasive problem. And I do believe that we have to weed that corruption out of the system and make it work for the majority of Americans in order to do the big things we need to do: attack global warming, have universal health care, the big issues that face America.
SCHIEFFER: What are the differences between taking money from the drug company lobbyists and from trial lawyers, which you take money from?
EDWARDS: Well, as I said just a minute ago, I don't claim purity and I don't claim holier-than-thou. I've raised over $30 million in this campaign. I think all of us share some responsibility in that regard. Now, it is true that I've never taken any money from a Washington lobbyist the entire time I've been in public life, or from a PAC--a special interest PAC. And I-and I'm proud of that.
But this is not about me or Senator Clinton, this is about what we have to do to clean up this system. And I think the difference is that lobbyists--registered lobbyists in Washington--their job is to pedal influence. Their job is to ensure that their clients, the people--big companies, in most cases, that they represent--get their way and the way laws are written.
SCHIEFFER: But...
EDWARDS: So I think, particularly in that case, we have to be very, very careful about limiting their influence.
SCHIEFFER: But you--you're not trying to tell me here this morning, are you, senator, that trial lawyers don't have an interest in what happens in Washington and what happens in the Congress?
EDWARDS: Oh, lord, no. No, of course not. No, not only wouldn't I say that, trial lawyers have lobbyists in Washington, just like every other group that's trying to influence the Congress. No, far from it. I'm not saying that.
And what I would say is we ought to--we ought to take all of their money influence out. None of them should have--all of them are entitled to a voice, Bob. The lawyers are entitled to a voice, the doctors are entitled to a voice, even the big corporations are entitled to a voice. The problem is, because they have so much money, particularly the big corporations, and because they spend so much money in lobbying--drug companies, insurance companies, oil companies--I mean, the net result is their influence is way out of proportion to the influence that ordinary Americans have, and I think they distort the laws that result from that influence. And what we have to do is start making this democracy work for everybody.
SCHIEFFER: Let me ask you this, senator, about one of your recent ads. One of your ads says that if you are president and Congress doesn't pass universal health care by July 2009, you are going to use your power as president to take Congress' health care plan away from them. How do you go about doing that?
EDWARDS: Well, can I just add one thing?
SCHIEFFER: Sure.
EDWARDS: There is another piece to that. I also say that I will take away--do--use my power, the power that I have available to take away the health care for members of my administration. And the basic idea is I don't think politicians in Washington should be protecting their health care when we have 47 million people in this country who don't have health care coverage.
But to answer your question, the most powerful tool that the president has is the bully pulpit. And that means making the case to America, submitting legislation to support exactly what I just said, and then making the case to America in any place--any congressional district or any state where a senator is opposing it--saying "your senator, your congressman is defending their health care at the same time that they're not providing health care for you."
SCHIEFFER: So...
EDWARDS: And I think that's the most powerful tool. But I would add to that, there are other tools. I mean, the president of the United States has veto power over budgets. So there are other tools available. But the most important thing is, Bob, wit--somebody's got to shake that place up.
SCHIEFFER: Mm-hmm.
SEN. GRAHAM: I mean, people have gotten complacent. The politicians take care of themselves, the lobbyists are everywhere, and I think we axe to--actually need to shake the place up. And that's what I'm talking about doing.
SCHIEFFER: But what you're talking about here, you would actually propose legislation to force Congress to give up its own health care and force them to vote on that? Is that--is that what you're saying, if they don't come around to providing health care for the rest of the country?
EDWARDS: That's exactly right. The whole point of this is not to take Congress' health care away. The point of this is to get health care for America. And I actually believe every Democratic member of Congress in the House and the Senate would vote for that, so it wouldn't be an issue for them. And I suspect a lot of Republicans would, too, because they don't want to have to go home and defend, in their congressional district, having supported their own health care and not having supported health care for their constituents.
SCHIEFFER: All right. Well, senator, let's take a break here.
We'll be back and continue this conversation in 60 seconds.
(Announcements)
SCHIEFFER: Back again with Senator John Edwards.
Senator, I'd like to--you talked and we've talked about Senator Clinton. I'd like to talk about some of the differences. You talked about her plans and what you see her doing regarding Iran and also Iraq. What's the difference in what you would do about Iraq and what she would do?
EDWARDS: Well, I think there are some basic questions that all of the presidential candidates should answer. Basically, all of us are saying rhetorically that we will end the war. But I think people are entitled to more specific information than that. I mean, do you have a specific plan, how many troops will you get out over what period of time, and is there some point at which all combat troops will be out of Iraq? Will combat missions cease in Iraq? Will you keep permanent military bases in Iraq? The answer to those question for me, Bob, is I would get all combat troops out within nine to 10 months, cease combat missions, and no permanent military bases.
And I haven't heard a specific plan from Senator Clinton. I don't think she's said exactly what she would do, except that I have heard her say on a stage standing next to me that she would keep combat troops stationed in Iraq and she would continue combat missions in Iraq. And, for me, that's a continuation of the occupation of Iraq, which is a huge issue for America and the world. So we have a different perspective about that.
SCHIEFFER: Don't we have to be very careful, senator, that what we do and if we draw down, that if we draw down too fast that this may be misread by others in the neighborhood out there? How do you address that?
EDWARDS: No, absolutely. And I think the president of the United States has a responsibility to do this the right way, and what I would do is take 40 to 50,000 combat troops out immediately, intensify the effort to make--to push the Shia and Sunni leadership to reach a political compromise. I would also engage in really intense diplomacy with other countries in the region, particularly the Iranians and the Syrians. It--they have an interest in a stable Iraq.
And then we have an interest in the region, which means we need to maintain a naval presence in the Persian Gulf, we may need to beef up our presence in Afghanistan, we probably should keep a quick reaction force in Kuwait. So it's not like we're abandoning the region. But I think we need to make it absolutely clear that we're ending our occupation of Iraq, which is why I laid out the proposal I did.
SCHIEFFER: President Bush says we cannot allow Iran to gain the knowledge to build nuclear weapons. Do you agree with him?
EDWARDS: I'm not entirely sure what he means by that. I think that what we know is that we have a president, Ahmadinejad, who's radical and bellicose in his rhetoric about us, about Israel, about our allies, and I also--we also know that the Iranian people have historically been among the most moderate in the Muslim world and the most pro-American in the Muslim world. I think that presents a huge opportunity to America if we're smart. If we work with our European friends and the European banking system to put a clear proposal very publicly on the table for the Iranians, that we will help them with their economy in a serious way--because their economy's in shambles--if they give up their nuclear proliferation ambitions. But if they don't, there will be severe economic consequences.
But I do believe that we--the vote on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and whether to declare that group a terrorist organization was a critical moment for the Democrats, and I think it was really important for us to stand up to Bush and Cheney. And Senator Dodd and Senator Clinton voted, as I believe was--took the correct position and were strong. Senator Clinton voted the other way and she's entitled to do that. I just have a strong disagreement with her about it. And then recently, as you well know, the administration declared the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization and a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction, which is exactly what a lot of us had feared.
SCHIEFFER: Some Democrats, some critics of the administration, say the president is really just looking for an excuse to get into Iran, to go in there with bombing strikes or some kind of military action. Are you one of those who believe that?
EDWARDS: I think it's possible. I can't read George Bush's mind. I gave that up...(network audio difficulties). But what I--what I do see is I see a continued pattern of behavior that's very similar to the pattern of behavior leading to Iraq. And I think that's why it's crucial for us, between now and January of 2009, to take every step we can take to stand strongly against Bush and Cheney continuing to move forward and on the march to military action in Iran.
SCHIEFFER: And one more question about foreign policy, and that is Pakistan, President Musharraf. The United States' Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte delivered a very blunt message to him yesterday, told him to lift the emergency rule and restore the constitution. He's given no sign that he's going to do that. Should we begin to cut off military aid to Pakistan?
EDWARDS: Well, we ought to, at a minimum--that is the leverage that we have--and we ought to, at a minimum, reform that aid. Because essentially what we've been doing is we have been aiding Musharraf. I mean, we helped Musharraf with F-16s. We helped Musharraf in supporting his power base as opposed to doing what we need to do for the Pakistani people. And I believe we ought to reform the nature of the aid we're providing. We ought to make certain that we're pushing toward fighting against terrorism, toward protection, toward doing what we need to do in the northwest--what needs to be done in the northwest territories, providing help directly to the Pakistani people to move them in the right direction.
I also think that we have some very basic things that we ought to be doing that we're not doing. We ought to be approaching this problem multilaterally with our friends around the world.
SCHIEFFER: Mm-hmm.
EDWARDS: We ought to--we ought to have a better knowledge base within our own government about the Pakistani people, their history. There was a report just a few days ago indicating we had very little expertise in that regard. And we need intense diplomacy. I mean, I think all those things are the comprehensive way of dealing with this issue.
SCHIEFFER: All right. Forty-six days to the Iowa caucuses. The polls suggest it's a dead heat. Do--is it--is it Iowa for you, and if you don't win there or do well, is your campaign done?
EDWARDS: I think anybody who doesn't do well in Iowa's going to have a struggle. I mean, we know that over the last few election cycles the winner of the Iowa caucus ended up being the Democratic nominee. As you point out, it's a--it's basically a tie there, at least according to the public polls. And I think if--I think it'll be a very intense campaigning process for the next-what did you say, 46 days? I haven't kept track of--track of the exact days. But I know we're getting close. And I've lived through this before, I know what Iowa caucus-goers care about, I know what they're concerned about. I think they're looking for the candidate who they believe is ready to be president; who, second, has specific, very specific ideas about what needs to be done, and I've lead on all the big, major issues in laying out a positive, very specific agenda. And third, they're looking for somebody who can win in the general election, because they don't want--they don't want to see four, eight more years of Republican--of a Republican White House.
SCHIEFFER: All right. What do you think "doing well' means? You said anybody who doesn't do well will have a struggle from here on. What is doing well for you in Iowa, senator?
EDWARDS: Well, obviously for any of the three of us who are tied--Senator Obama, Senator Clinton or myself--winning is doing well. But if it's close, and it's a close contest, then that could also be doing well. Finishing second or close could be doing well. So...
SCHIEFFER: All right.
EDWARDS: ...I think it's very hard to say in advance what that means. But I think it's-I do want to say, I think it's a very important place, just as New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada are to all three of us.
SCHIEFFER: All right. Thank you very much, senator. We'll be talking to you again before then, I hope.
EDWARDS: Thank you.
SCHIEFFER: And we'll back with a little analysis in just a minute.
EDWARDS: Thank you, Bob.

Excerpts of Remarks at the DNC Fall Meeting in Washington, DC

November 30, 2007

There's a wall around Washington and we need to take it down. The American people are on the outside. And on the other side, on the inside, are the powerful, the well-connected and the very wealthy. That wall didn't build itself or appear overnight. For decades, politicians without convictions and powerful interests gathered their bricks and their stones and their mortar, and they went to work. They went to work to protect their interests, to block the voice of the American people, and to stop our country's progress. They went to work to protect, defend, and maintain the status quo.
"That wall around Washington, it protects a system that's rigged and guess who struggles as a result? Every single day, working men and women see that wall when they have to split their bills into two piles pay-now and pay-later; when they watch the factory door shut for the last time; when they see the disappointment on their son or daughter's face when there's no money to pay for college. Every single day they see that wall when they have to use the emergency room as a doctor's office for their son because they can't afford to pay for health care. This is not okay. That wall has to come down.
*****
"That's why America needs a fighter, Democrats. We need one to break down that wall so that we can see Our AmericaвЂ”imagine Our AmericaвЂ”and build one America.
*****
"This is bigger than politics. Bigger than any candidate or political party. Because the truth is that it's not just Republicans who built this wall. Democrats helped too. Too many politicians from both parties are choosing self-preservation over principle, compromise over convictions.
"You have a choice in this election. You have to decide what kind of person you want as your next president. Do you want someone who is going to pretend that wall around Washington isn't there, or defend the people who helped build it? Or do you want someone who is going to lead with conviction and tell you the truth, and have a little backbone? Do you want someone who is going to hope that the people who spent millions of dollars and decades building that wall, and have billions more invested in keeping it up, are going to be willing to compromise, to take it down voluntarily? Or do you want someone who is going to stand up to those people and fight for your interests, when the chips are down, when your backs are against the wall, every single day?
"We have a choice in this election. We can keep trying to shout over that wall. We can keep trying to knock out a chink here and there, to punch little holes in it and hope our voices get through. We can settle for baby steps, half-measures and incremental change, and try to inch our way over that wall and toward a better future. Or we can be bold and knock it down.
*****
"This is going to be the fight of our lives. I know because I've spent my whole life fighting the powerful on behalf of hard-working people, and I can tell you this: they are not going to give up their power easily. But I can also tell you this: if you fight them вЂ“ and you are right вЂ“ you can win.
*****
"Democrats, America needs a fighter because this campaign is about something much bigger than celebrity politics, who's up and who's down. It's about a great moral test of our time. Twenty generations of Americans have passed this simple but profound test: Can our generation leave this country better for our children than it was when our parents gave it to us? In the best of times and the worst of times, in the middle of wars and droughts and depressions like we've never seen, they found a way to leave the country better than it was given to them. But, now, let's be honest with ourselves. We вЂ“ this generation sitting here today вЂ“ may be the very first generation of Americans since the founding of our republic to fail this test
*****
"We have to fight for our futureвЂ”for our America. Because when we look our children in the eye, what will we tell them? Will we be forced to say that we left this mess to them, because the challenges were just too great? Or will we be able to look at them and say that in the face of great challenges, we changed our country. We rose to the day. We fixed a broken system and made our country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before. This is our moment."

Excerpts of Remarks in Ames, Iowa

December 16, 2007

"America was built on an idea вЂ“ that all of us are equal. The idea that how hard you work, and what kind of choices you make will determine the kind of life you build, and what you pass onto your children вЂ“ but not the circumstances you're born into, never that. The greatness of America is that promise вЂ“ that every generation will leave its children a better life. That is our social compact with the middle class вЂ“ the promise that if you work hard and do what's right, you'll be able to build a better life for yourself and your family. But today, that compact is being threatened."
"Here's what's happened вЂ“ corporate greed and political calculation have taken over our government and sold out the middle class. Washington isn't looking out for the middle class because Washington doesn't work for the middle class anymoreвЂ¦That is wrong. It doesn't say life, liberty and the pursuit of endless corporate profit in the Declaration of Independence. America is about opportunity for youвЂ¦ and your families, your children. But our government is selling out their future at the command of lobbyists and their corporate clients and we have to rise up together and stop it. We have to rise up and say, no more. Not on our watch."
* * * * *
"We need a president who will take these powers on and fight to get you your voice back, and your government back. We need a president who is going to fight every day to make sure that all Americans can find good jobs, save for the future, and be guaranteed health care and retirement security. We need a president who is going to lift up the middle class. That is why today, I am proposing my Middle Class Rising agenda, a comprehensive plan to help hardworking families get ahead, and make sure that all Americans have a fair shot at the American Dream."
* * * * *
"None of this is going to be easy. I hear all these candidates talking about how we're going to bring about the big, bold change that America needs. And I hear some people saying that they think we can sit at a table with drug companies, oil companies and insurance companies, and they will give their power away. That is a fantasy. We have a fight in front of us. We have a fight for the future of this country. And the change we need will not happen easily. We need someone who is going to step into that arena on your behalf, someone who is ready for that fight."
* * * * *
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have been in this fight my whole life. From the time I was young, until when I was a lawyer. For twenty years, I walked into courtrooms representing families like yours against big corporations and their armies of lawyers. Every time, they looked at me and said, we can win. But they didn't. Because I beat them. I beat them. And I beat them again. And I learned that it may not be easy to beat these powerful interests, but if you're right, and you're willing to stand up, you can win."
* * * * *
"That's what the American people have always done. Every time in our history that the American people have been faced with great challenges, they rose up and met them. They made certain that they left America better than they found it; they left their children a better life than they had. That's what your parents did. It's what your grandparents did. And it's what my parents did for me."
* * * * *
"I take it very personally when I see powerful, well-financed interests taking over this democracy, and taking it away from regular Americans, people like my parents. We have got to reclaim this democracy for them. For you. For your children. For your grandchildren. Because if we don't, we're going to have to look our children in the eye and say, "we're leaving this mess to you." Our parents didn't do that. Our grandparents didn't do it. Twenty generations of Americans who came before us didn't do it. And I'll tell you something: we're not going to do it. We're going to make absolutely certain that America rises again."

Remarks Following the Iowa Caucuses

January 3, 2008

Thank you. Thank you.
The one thing that's clear from the results in Iowa tonight is the status quo lost and change won.
(APPLAUSE)
And now we move on. We move on from Iowa to New Hampshire and to the other states to determine who's best suited to bring about the change that this country so desperately needed. Because what we've seen here in Iowa is we've seen two candidates who thought their money would make them inevitable. But what the Iowa caucus-goers have shown, is if you're willing to have a little backbone, to have a little courage, to speak for the middle class, to speak for those who have no voice.
(APPLAUSE)
If you're willing -- if you're willing to stand up to corporate greed, that message and the American people are unstoppable. No matter how much money is spent, no matter how much. And we are so proud of this cause.
But I want all of us to remember tonight while we're having all these political celebrations, that just a few weeks ago in America, Nataline Sarkisian (ph), a 17- year-old girl who had a -- needed a liver transplant, and whose insurance company decided they wouldn't pay for her liver transplant operation.
Finally, her nurses spoke up on her behalf. Her doctors spoke up on her behalf. Ultimately, the American people spoke up on her behalf by marching and picketing in front of her health insurance carrier. And, finally, the insurance carrier caved in and agreed to pay for her operation. And when they notified the family just a few hours later, she died. She lost her life. Why? Why?
James Lowe was born 51 years ago in the United States of America with a severe cleft palate, which kept him from being able to speak. And he lived for 50 years in the greatest, most prosperous nation on the planet, not able to speak because he didn't have health-care coverage and couldn't pay for a simple operation. Why?
Doug Bishop, who's actually behind me tonight, Doug and his family worked at the Maytag plant in Newton -- Newton, Iowa. For generations, for generations, they worked. They sacrificed. They did everything you're supposed to do in America. And then recently, this plant closed. And the jobs went overseas. Why? The reason is because corporate greed has got a stranglehold on America. And unless and until we have a president in the proud tradition of Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, who has a little backbone, who has some strength, who has some fight, who's willing to stand up to these people, nothing will change.
We will never have the America that all of us dream of. The promise of America, which has been available to so many of us, will not be available to our children and our grandchildren. And I take this very personally.
I watched my grandmother, who I loved dearly, work year after year after year in the mills. And we lived in the same neighborhood. She would cook for us, leave the house, walk her way to the mill, work her shift, and come back home and take care of us again.
My grandfather, who was partially paralyzed, would go to work the graveyard shift in that mill and come back in the morning, when we'd have breakfast together.
My father, who's here with me tonight, worked 36 years in the mills -- hard, tedious work; hard, tedious work. Why did he do it? Why did he struggle and sacrifice? Why did your parents and grandparents struggle and sacrifice? They did it so that you could have a better life. My parents did it so that I could have a better life.
And we, all of us to whom the torch has been passed, we carry an enormous responsibility. And that responsibility transcends politics and transcends elections. It's our responsibility to ensure that we leave America better than we found it; that we give our children a better life than we've had.
And this is what I see in America today. I see an America where last year, the CEO of one of the largest health insurance companies in America made hundreds of millions of dollars -- in one year.
I see an America where ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) profits were $40 billion just a couple of years ago. Record amounts -- record profits.
All of that happening at the same time that this picture of America emerges. Tonight, 47 million Americans will go to bed knowing that if their child gets sick, they'll have to go to the emergency room and beg for health care. Tomorrow morning, women will go to their doctor and be diagnosed with breast cancer, just like Elizabeth was. But unlike Elizabeth, they'll have no health care coverage. And as a result, they know that they can't go to the emergency room and get chemotherapy. What are they supposed to do? What are they supposed to do? You can literally see the fear and terror in their eyes.
Tomorrow morning, 37 million of our own people will wake up literally worried about feeding and clothing their own children. I went to a shelter here in Des Moines just a few weeks ago, where they took single moms with their children who had no place to live. And I said: Do you ever have to turn people away? Yes, a few months ago, they had to turn 70 to 75 families away in one month. And I said: These are moms with kids -- yes -- some of them with three or four children. And I said: Well, where did they go when you sent them away? They went back to the street, back to their homes. Thirty-five million people in America went hungry last year in the richest nation on the planet.
And tonight, 200,000 men and women who wore our uniform proudly and served this country courageously as veterans will go to sleep under bridges and on grates. We're better than this. The United States of America's better than this. And what happened tonight is the Iowa caucus-goers said, we want something different. We are going to stand up, we are going to rise up, we're going to create an America that all of us believe in.
Because the truth is, when we speak up, when we speak up for James Lowe and the millions like him who live in the darkness, when we speak up against corporate greed and for the 37 million Americans who live in poverty, when we speak up for single moms who have no place to live with their children, when we speak up for hundreds of thousands of veterans who served this country proudly and are homeless with no place to live at night, when we do that together, as a nation -- and Iowa caucus-goers did it tonight -- when we do it, America's a better place.
It says something about who we are. It says something about our character. Because when we do, America rises up. America becomes what it's capable of being. And what began -- and it is not over -- what began tonight in the heartland of America is the Iowa caucus- goers said: Enough is enough. We are better than this. We are going to bring the change that this country needs. And you have created and started a wave of change, a tidal wave of change that will travel from here to New Hampshire to Nevada to South Carolina, all across this country.
(APPLAUSE)
Because we know the torch has been passed to us. We stand proudly on the shoulders of our parents and grandparents and all those generations who came before us. And we take our responsibility seriously.
And this tidal wave of change that began tonight in Iowa and that will sweep across America, when that wave is finished, when it is done, every one of us are going to be able to look our children in the eye and say, we did what our parents did for us and what our grandparents did for us. Which is: We left America better than we found it, and we gave our children a better life than we had.
That's what this is about. That's what this change is about.
Continue on. This march of change continues on. God bless you. Thank you for everything you've done. Stay with us in this fight. We are in this fight together. Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)

Remarks Following the New Hampshire Primary

January 8, 2008

Thank you all so much for being here tonight.
(APPLAUSE)
You know, last week, I congratulated Senator Obama when he finished first and I finished second in Iowa. One race down. Tonight, I congratulate Senator Clinton and Senator Obama, two races down. Forty-eight states left to go.
So up until now, about 0.5 percent of Americans have voted; 99 percent-plus have not voted. And those 99 percent deserve to have their voices heard, because we have had too much in America of people's voices not being heard. I have met too many Americans whose voices have not been heard in this democracy.
Just this past week, I spent time with the family of Nataline Sarkisyan. Nataline is a 17-year-old girl who, just a few weeks ago, desperately needed a liver transplant. Her parents had health insurance with one of the biggest insurance companies in America.
They asked for the insurance company to pay for her liver transplant operation, and they rejected them. Then, the doctors came to her aid. They spoke up on her behalf. The nurses spoke up on her behalf. And then the insurance company said no again.
Finally, the family stood up and fought. They started to march and picket, along with many other Americans, in front of the offices of this insurance company.
And the insurance company finally gave in, but it was too late. And a few hours later, Nataline lost her life.
A few months ago, I met a 51-year-old man in the mountains of Virginia named James Lowe. James had been born with a severe cleft pallet. Because he had a cleft pallet, he could not speak.
A simple operation would have fixed his problem, but he had no health care coverage. And so he couldn't pay for it. Finally, somebody voluntarily fixed his cleft pallet, and now he can speak.
The problem is they fixed it when he was 50 years old. James Lowe lived for 50 years in the United States of America not able to speak because he had no health care coverage.
Tonight, a man or a woman whose name is unknown, who served this country patriotically and wore the uniform of the United States of America, will go to sleep under a bridge or on a grate, homeless.
You know, we've had too many Americans whose voices have not been heard in this democracy. That's what this battle is about.
It is not about me. It is about the cause of giving voice to all of those whose voices are not being heard in this democracy.
(APPLAUSE)
Tonight, we stand at a crossroads in the history of America. It is not that we don't know what it is we aspire to. We know exactly what we aspire to: universal health care; attacking global warming; and protecting the environment; ending poverty in the United States of America; standing up for American jobs and for the creation of American jobs.
(APPLAUSE)
The question is not what we aspire to. The question is, how do we get there? What will it take?
Four years ago, I spoke a great deal about the need for hope and inspiration in America. During this campaign, I've spoke about the need for principled action and the need for change in the United States of America.
We know what needs to be done. The only question is whether we have the backbone, and the will, and the determination to go there.
And here's what I have to say about this. Because of people like Alexis, who's a young woman who spoke to me this afternoon who has a serious health condition, and who has made thousands and thousands of phone calls on my behalf, because of the men and women of organized labor, the carpenters, the steelworkers, the service employee workers, because of those who have called, and knocked on doors, and worked tirelessly on behalf of this cause, this cause to create the America that all of us believe in, because of that, I want to be absolutely clear to all of you who have been devoted to this cause, and I want to be clear to the 99 percent of Americans who have not yet had the chance to have their voices heard, that I am in this race to the convention, that I intend to be the nominee of my party.
(APPLAUSE)
And I am in this race until we have actually restored the American dream and strengthened and restored the middle class of America.
And so I ask all of you here and all of you who can hear the sound of my voice, the 99 percent whose voices have not yet been heard in this democracy, to join us in this grassroots campaign to create the kind of America that all of us believe in.
God bless you. Thank you for being here. It's my privilege to be with you. Thank you.

Interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' "Face the Nation"

January 20, 2008

SCHIEFFER: And good morning again.
Well, there's big news overnight. If it came too late for your morning paper, John McCain did win the Republican primary in South Carolina. This was really a must-win for Senator McCain over Mike Huckabee. And in Nevada, it was Hillary Clinton in a state where Barack Obama had the support of two powerful labor unions. And to put some icing on the cake for her, she got 64 percent of the Hispanic vote, which really augurs well for super Tuesday, when states like California and Arizona, which have large Hispanic populations, go to the polls. Mitt Romney won in the Republican Nevada primary, but the other Republicans really didn't compete there.
Joining us now, Democrat John Edwards, who I must say did not do well yesterday in Nevada, which raises questions about where he goes from here. He's in South Carolina this morning.
And I guess that's where we start, senator. Can you keep your campaign going?
EDWARDS: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely, Bob. I mean, I'm now in South Carolina. I got my butt kicked in Nevada. And what you learn from that is, from all my life when that's happened to me, you just got to get up and start fighting, and particularly when you're fighting for the causes of your life, which is making sure that people who don't have a voice get a voice, and fighting for the middle class and low income families. That's what my life is about. And I'm here in South Carolina, the place that I was born, fighting with everything I got.
SCHIEFFER: Well, senator, let me ask you this. Do you think this has less to do with you and more to do with just historical forces, that you just sort of had the bad luck to run for president on the year when you have the first woman to be seriously considered as electable to the presidency running along with the first African-American to be seriously considered as electable?
EDWARDS: Oh, do I think that's a factor? Of course it's a factor. There's no doubt about that. And we've got a couple of candidates who've gotten massive publicity and raised $100 million-plus each. But I'm not in the business of making excuses, Bob. Not about Nevada, not about the campaign. All three of us are going to be perfectly fine when this thing's over. The question is, will we have done what needs to be done for America? I mean, are we going to do what has to be done to preserve the middle class and help low income families and help single moms who have no health insurance and bringing this war to an end? I mean, that's what this is about. It's not about any of--any of us personally.
SCHIEFFER: Well, but the polling in Nevada yesterday seemed to suggest that Senator Clinton was the one who could do those kinds of things. I mean, here you had these big labor unions endorsing Senator Obama, and yet she carried union households when asked who's the candidate with exactly the right experience. She just swamped everybody in the field on that. I mean, what is it about your message--why can't you get your message out?
EDWARDS: Well, for all the reasons you just talked about, Bob. And first of all, congratulations to Senator Clinton. She should be congratulated for what happened in Nevada. But she and Senator Obama have both spent massive amounts of money there, put a massive effort into the--into the state. We didn't run a single radio or television ad.
But the excuses are meaningless. I mean, what matters here is what's going to happen for the country, what--Senator Clinton and Senator Obama both get an enormous amount of attention, as they have from over a year ago, but I think the key for me is to keep fighting for what it is I believe in. It's what I've done--I'm 54 years old, Bob, I've been doing this all my life, and I'm certainly not going to stop now, fighting for the people that I'm fighting for. And that's exactly what I'm going to do here in South Carolina, and this is a place I know very well.
SCHIEFFER: Well, what exactly is your strategy here, senator? I mean, are you trying to hang around to hope for a brokered convention? I mean, it seems to me somewhere along the way you got to win a primary here.
EDWARDS: Oh, of course I do, there's no question about that. But this is a long process. As much--as much as the media likes to think that all of America is obsessed with what happened in Nevada or in Iowa or in New Hampshire, we've had three states vote so far out of 50. We've got 47 left to vote. And if you take this as--in a long view, which I do--you know, I'm seasoned to this, I've been through it before--you know that there are lots of ups and downs in these campaigns. I mean, I see--I just heard you announcing Senator McCain's victory in South Carolina. The national media had written him off four or five months ago, said he was dead, had no chance. I heard it over and over and over, and all of a sudden he's now the Republican front-runner. I'm just telling you this is a long process, and this is going to go on for a while.
SCHIEFFER: You, in a strategy memo that was, quote, "leaked," and a lot of the news media picked up on, you referred to Senator Clinton and Senator Obama as the celebrity candidates, and you also talked about Senator Obama being too weak to stand up to the Republicans and Senator Clinton being too corporate. What do you mean by those characterizations?
EDWARDS: Well, first of all, let me just say about each of them, they're both very good candidates. There's a reason that they are where they are. It's not an accident. And they deserve credit for it. They have gotten an enormous amount of attention, but they've run very good campaigns, both of them. I think there are differences in the approach that each one of us take to this race. Senator Clinton, I think, is more the old style, Washington working the way it does, and it's OK to take the money from the lobbyists and the special interest PACs, which I've never done, and I'm proud of.
Senator Obama, I think, has a lot of--a lot of great ideas, and he does believe in change. I believe he believes in change. He believes in it deeply. But he has what I would describe as a more academic approach to it than I do. I think if you're going to bring about change you have to be willing to fight for that change, that it's not going to happen unless you're willing to take on these moneyed interests.
So I think each of us have a very different perspective on how we do what needs to be done for America.
SCHIEFFER: Some people in the Clinton campaign are telling me privately this morning they now believe that this thing will be wrapped up on super Tuesday. Why do you believe that's not so? Or do you?
EDWARDS: Oh, I have--this--we have a long way to go. And we got a primary in South Carolina this Saturday. There's no way--the one thing we know from all the polls and everything else, from these first three contests, is these races are enormously unpredictable. And that's certainly true here in South Carolina. And then we go to February 5th, where there're states all over the country, big states--like New York, California--but there're also a lot of other states--Oklahoma, Kansas--there're a whole group of states up from all across America that in many ways represents the cross-section of America.
And what we need to think about is--as a party--is who are we going to put up against who now looks like it may be John McCain on the other side. I mean, this is a guy who's a great advocate for campaign finance reform. So are we going to put a candidate against him who've taken in lots of money from lobbyists and PACs? And he's also a very strong candidate, with a long, long record, including an extraordinary record of military service. So he will be strong. And we have to put up somebody who's strong against him and somebody who represents change in a meaningful way.
SCHIEFFER: Do you think this controversy that broke out over--basically, over race between Senator Clinton and Senator Obama is over? Or will that come back?
EDWARDS: I don't know the answer to the--I don't--that's a good question, Bob. I don't know the answer to that. I sure hope it's over. It's not good for my party, and I think much more important than that, as much as I love the Democratic Party, it's not good for America. I mean, I grew up in the South in the '50s and '60s, and I've seen--I've seen too much of this. And I want to see us continue--we've made progress, we still have huge work to do on issues of race and equality in this country. But we shouldn't be stirring historical problems. Instead, what we ought to be doing is moving this country forward on this issue. It's a very important thing for America.
SCHIEFFER: One quick question. If you do not do well in South Carolina, do you plan to go on to super Tuesday?
EDWARDS: Absolutely. Absolutely. I've said over and over I am committed to this. My cause has not gone away, and I'm in it for the long haul.
SCHIEFFER: All right. Senator, thank you very much. Hope we'll talk to you again.

Interview with Kevin Sack of The New York Times

January 25, 2008

SACK: So much of the narrative of your campaign, and really of your life recently, has to do with health care, given your wife's very public illness. So I am wondering how your own experiences with her illness, and with the medical system generally, have molded your views about changing the system, and try to be as detailed as possible?
EDWARDS: Well, they played a role. We have, through Elizabeth's health care problems, we've had a great deal of experience with the health care system and the difficulties that — and we have great health insurance — but even the difficulties that people with insurance have, which are far less than the people who have no health coverage. And I would add to that, that we've had, because of Elizabeth's experience, we have lots of people who come to us with their personal health care stories. So I think those two things in combination have given us an insight into how — how much the health care — the dysfunction of the health care system dominates people's lives in a way that it's overwhelming, in many cases. For example, single mothers who come to us say they've been diagnosed with breast cancer, they don't have health care and they have no idea what to do. I've seen how difficult going through Elizabeth's breast cancer treatment is for us with good health care coverage. I mean it's almost hard to imagine how hard it is for women going through the similar circumstance. And then also just the work I have done on the ground, on poverty, has put me in contact with lots of people around the country, who, because I go to a lot of community action centers, shelters, places that take care of and help the poor, puts me in contact with a lot of people with no health coverage. And so I think all those things in combination have had a significant impact.
SACK: Has there been anything specifically in her treatment that has given you a firsthand look at that dysfunction, whether it's from insurance companies, with payments being refused, kicked back, paperwork, medical errors or anything like that?
EDWARDS: Yes, I mean when you get the statements by the providers and the insurance companies about what's covered and what's not covered, even for two people who are well versed in the law and experienced with the health care system, it seems completely arbitrary in many cases. It doesn't make any sense.
And if it's hard for us to understand, number one, probably that's because many times it's nonsensical and not based on anything legitimate. And secondly it's just, I can just imagine what it's like for people who have no legal training or any reason to understand. I mean, I think there's so many, even if you have health coverage, there are so many barriers set up to actually getting payment for the services, the health care services people need, that I am sure it's just overwhelming.
SACK: You boast along the campaign trail about being the first to produce a health care plan, and I guess I am curious about why voters should care about that. What does that tell them about you, relative to the other candidates? Isn't the more relevant question whose plan is best? Seems like some people could argue that, yeah you have the first plan, but you've also been running the longest so that wouldn't necessarily be a surprise. Tell voters why it's important that you were first.
EDWARDS: Well, I think they're both important. I think coming first is an indication of how you prioritize health care. How important it is to what you want to do as president. I came out with my plan — you should check this, but I think it was February. And I know Senator Obama came out a few months later — I don't have the, you probably know, but I don't have the dates in my head. And Senator Clinton came out with hers this fall, this past fall, so months later.
And I think what it means is — number one — that I knew what I wanted to do with health care. Number two — that I think by getting out and being specific, about universal, about the substance of the plan, it also has the effect of driving the debate. It makes it very difficult for other candidates to float through on rhetoric. I mean Senator Clinton spent months saying she was for universal health care without having to make any choices. So I think it means something, number one — I think it means how I am prepared to lead on this issue as president. Number two — I wasn't waiting to see what others said to figure out what the politics were. I knew what I wanted to do. And number three — I think it helped drive the debate in the presidential race. So I think it is important, but that's not to downplay the importance of the substance of the plan.
SACK: The plan you're proposing is far more expensive than the one you proposed four years ago. Talk a little about the evolution of your thinking — what was it, if anything, about your personal experience or the experience of the country, changed conditions, increase in the number of the uninsured, that made you take a more aggressive approach to universal health care this time?
EDWARDS: Well, I concluded that something bolder was needed, that the health care system had become increasingly dysfunctional, and my contact with a lot of uninsured Americans, who were not children, made it clear to me that the plan had to be universal, that it had to cover everybody. So I think it's a combination of what I saw as an increasing dysfunction, an increasing number of uninsured, health insurance premiums continuing to skyrocket, plus my personal contact with so many people telling me their stories. I mean, if I can be a little more specific about this, I mean, one of the things I did in the interim between 2004 and announcing for president a few years later, was traveling around the country to lots of places, lots of states and going into centers that were helping low-income families, and that put me in a position of constantly talking to single moms, to the uninsured, about the problems that they were faced with and what impact it was having on their lives, and that also had an effect on me.
SACK: Did you notice a change in the country's attitude towards health insurance between '04 and '08?
EDWARDS: Yes, but I wouldn't want to overstate the case. I think there has been a significant change in the country's attitude since the '90s, so I think it's gone over a period of time. I think it's become more intense since 2003, 2004. And the problems have become increasingly worse, have become worse, but I think it's been on a continuum.
SACK: The insurance companies are prominent on your list of villains, along with the pharmaceutical companies, the oil companies. What makes them such baddies?
EDWARDS: Well, what I'm referring to is the fact that they stand as obstacles to change. I'll give you an example. When we were doing the Medicare prescription drug law in the Senate.
And those of us who were working on it — again, it was not just me, there were many people working on it — it became clear that there were certain things that needed to happen. We should have been using the power of the government to negotiate the best price, we should be allowing prescription drugs to be reimported from Canada, we should be using the power we have to try to regulate drug company advertising on television, those kind of things. And the drug company lobby was a powerful force in preventing those things. And, the same thing happened more recently with the effort by Congress to do something about reverse payments, these payments that are being made by drug companies to generics to keep cheaper drugs, generic drugs, off the market. Congress took up the issue and planned to do something about it and the drug company lobby effectively killed it. I think these are just examples. I encountered the insurance company lobby directly when John McCain, Senator Kennedy and I got the Patients' Bill of Rights passed in the Senate. It later got killed, but it got passed in the Senate. I know how effective they are and I know how much money they spend to prevent the kind of reform that, in my judgment, this country needs.
SACK: In shaping your plan why did you decide against single-payer that would guarantee universal coverage? If you hate the insurance companies so much why not put them out of business with one swift blow?
EDWARDS: Completely fair question. I looked hard at single-payer. Proponents of single-payer have some very strong arguments, particularly the elimination of profit motive in a health care system. Medicare, for example, runs at 3 to 4 percent overhead compared to some insurance companies charging 30 to 40 percent profit and overhead, so I thought that there was a legitimate and strong argument for it.
But I also believed that there are an awful lot of Americans who like the health care they have and are nervous about entirely government-controlled health care. So I heard both sides, and by the way throughout this campaign I've heard both sides. I'll never forget, I had an event in Concord, N.H., not long ago where a guy stood up and said, "I don't understand why you are not proposing single-payer. The Canadian system is a good system." Not 15 minutes later a woman on the other side of the room said, "I just want to say, I like the idea of universal health care but my" — she had a relative, I've forgotten what — "living in Canada and she has to wait six months to get the tests that I can get in a week."
So I think people are very divided over that issue. So what I intentionally did was construct a system where the American people would effectively make that decision for themselves, so that they could choose in a health care market between either a private insurer or essentially Medicare-plus. And so that they would have to compete with one another.
SACK: You've said in the past the plan could gravitate either way. Because you are introducing the Medicare-plus as you describe it, a federal plan that people would have the option to choose, that the plan could gravitate in either direction. Which seems in some way to sort of acknowledge in some way what the Republicans contend, which is that the Democratic plans are sort of a back door to single-payer. Do you think that's right? And is it O.K. by you if does eventually morph into a single-payer system?
EDWARDS: There is nothing backdoor about it. It's right through the front door. We're going to let America decide what health care system works for them. I'm not deciding that for them. America's going to decide it. American health consumers will decide which works best. It could continue to be divided. But it could go in one direction or the other and one of the directions is obviously government or single payer. And I'm not opposed to that, as I've said many times. I think that if we're doing what needs to be done to seriously and comprehensively reform the system — cover everybody, dramatically reduce costs — I think there are roughly $120-125 billion of savings each year in this proposal that I have made. You're probably going to ask me about that in a minute — if we're doing what we need to do to create efficiencies, drive down costs, get everybody covered and leaving open to America what system makes the most sense to them, to me that's a sensible approach to this issue.
SACK: Do you think it will be a problem in the fall, your openness to that option? Will that just be red meat to the Republicans, socialized medicine and all that?
EDWARDS: No, my argument is really very simple to America. If you believe that what you are paying for health care and how the health care system operates today is satisfactory, you should vote for the Republican candidate. If you think we need serious, comprehensive reform, you should vote for me.
SACK: Let's talk about whether Americans should be required to have insurance. You and Senator Clinton say that you have to have a mandate to reach universal coverage. Senator Obama respectfully disagrees. He'd only mandate coverage for children. A lot of commentators say that in the larger context of Democratic versus Republican positioning on health care that this difference is so small as to be insignificant. Are they wrong? Do you think that Obama's position is a serious shortcoming? Or is this sort of a minor disagreement that's being magnified to play to certain constituencies in the primaries?
EDWARDS: The threshold question of any health care plan is 'Is it universal?' and his plan is not universal. So I don't think it's a minor thing. I think it's a serious thing. He's to be applauded for coming out with a serious plan, let's be fair. But his plan is not universal, and to argue that it's universal is not the truth.
I believe that his argument against mandates, which he made Monday night — did you watch the debate Monday night — which he made Monday night and I made the comparison then to Social Security. To me, it's like arguing that you should be able to opt out of Social Security. No, we've decided that as a nation this is a comprehensive plan for all seniors and everyone's going to be part of it. The same is true of a universal health care plan. So I think there is a fundamental divide between my plan and Senator Clinton's plan and his, because ours are universal and his is not. And I think we need universal care.
SACK: Define the term for me. How universal is universal? What we're learning from the experience in Massachusetts is they can't really cover everybody even though they've got a mandate. They're offering exceptions for people who can't afford it even in a heavily subsidized system and while their enrollment is doing pretty well, it's clear to them that there are going to be some people who just calculate the penalty as preferable to the mandate. The Schwarzenegger plan that's being considered in California would also leave some people out. So, is universal near-universal or is there really a way to cover every American?
EDWARDS: First let's distinguish between what I'm proposing and what Senator Obama is proposing. His plan has no mandate. I have seen some calculations that indicate there could be as many as 12-15 million people could be left uncovered. What you're asking about now are people that may fall in the cracks. We will do everything in our power to cover everybody. Basically what happens is — and I actually haven't heard Senator Clinton say how she would enforce her mandate, so I'm not sure what she would do — I've heard some talk from some of the people who work for her but I haven't heard her say it. What our mandate would do is anytime people come into contact with the system, whether it's in the hospital or paying their taxes etc., and they're not enrolled in something — Medicaid, S-CHIP, private insurance, Medicare plus — then they will be enrolled. Let's go to the next step, you can play this out. If they then refuse to pay their premiums, it will be our responsibility as a nation to go collect the premiums.
SACK: Thru what mechanisms?
EDWARDS: Through the normal collection mechanisms...
SACK: Through garnishment? Through taxes?
EDWARDS: Whatever collection mechanisms would be most effective.
SACK: What are some options?
EDWARDS: The ones you just mentioned are some.
SACK: Under your plan will some people be exempt? Will there be a need for some kind of hardship exemption, or will the subsidies be adequate to lure everybody in?
EDWARDS: I have not proposed a hardship exemption. Realistically, we know as we put this plan into place, as we start implementation, there may be some tinkering that needs to be done to it. Maybe in some cases the subsidy needs to be raised. Maybe we need to make certain that it covers a certain small group of people that aren't getting what they need. There are a variety of things that we may need to tinker with on the edges to make sure it works the way it needs to work. But the fundamentals won't change and the plan is to cover everybody.
SACK: And on enforcement, the penalty would be that they have to buy a policy. There wouldn't be a financial penalty over and above that.
EDWARDS: That's right.
SACK: Your mandate would only kick in once insurance is deemed affordable. Talk about how that's going to be determined and it seems like that potentially could be a pretty big loophole. How long do you estimate that would take to kick in?
EDWARDS: Well, all these things are unknowable with certainty. I mean, first of all, let's live in the real world for a moment instead of just academia. The first thing we've got to do is we've got to get the health care plan passed into law. And there are a whole group of principles that I will never walk away from in my health care proposal. But the reality is as it goes through Congress, it will get tinkered with. I mean, that's just the way these things work, as everyone knows. So the first thing you've got to do is you've got to get it passed. Then you've got to start the process of implementation and bringing people into the system who have not been part of the health care system. So for me to try to sit here now and predict exactly how long that's going to take, I think is not realistic. I can't do that. We will do it aggressively, and we will try to get everyone covered as quickly as can possibly be accomplished, and as we find small areas where we need to make it work more effectively, we'll make those changes.
SACK: Well, how are you going to define affordable? If the notion is that the mandate only kicks in once insurance is affordable, can you give us some guidelines on that?
EDWARDS: Sure. If you are living at or near the poverty line, you're going to be essentially 100 percent subsidized. If you are up to about 250% of poverty, which is probably around $50,000 income for a family of four, you will have very low premiums, very low co-pays. And then, above that level, you'll continue to be subsidized up to about $100,000 of income.
SACK: Obama doesn't rule out mandates. He says that he'd consider one down the road if he finds that it's necessary to reach universality. So given that he's saying that and that you're saying that yours won't kick in immediately, aren't you guys really sort of in the same place?
EDWARDS: Absolutely not. If you start the process of trying to get a health care plan through Congress without it being universal, and without a mandate, then you're starting from a weak position. You have to begin with the principle of universal coverage. That is a principle that can not be conceded. We've already, you and I have talked today about there may be various mechanisms that people will suggest to do it more effectively. I have my own plan, I'm proud of it, but if people have other ideas that make sense I'm open to that. What I'm not open to is not covering everybody. Everyone has to be covered. And no I don't think we're the same.
SACK: If one of the enforcement mechanisms would catch people at the point that they're using the system, do you think that could be a disincentive at all for people to use the system?
EDWARDS: I'm not following you.
SACK: When you're talking about that the mandate — you said that when people access the system, if they're not insured, they would then be enrolled. So, if somebody's ill and doesn't have insurance, doesn't want to pay those premiums, might it be a disincentive for them to engage with the system?
EDWARDS: I don't, I think – My view is that's far-fetched. I think somebody who is sick enough to need health care they're going to go get it.
SACK: Are there any substantive differences between your plan and Clinton's plan?
EDWARDS: Yes.
SACK: Talk about them.
EDWARDS: Both of us have similar proposals for savings in Medicare. But because she funds her plan by rolling back Bush's tax cuts for those who earn $250,000 and above, and I fund mine by rolling back Bush's tax cuts for people who make $200,000 and above, that gap has to be made up somewhere. And so what she does is she takes the, and I'll be glad to go through them, but our proposals are very similar for savings in Medicare, she takes that savings out of Medicare and uses it help fund her universal plan. I keep the savings in Medicare, and the reason I'm, and everyone knows how intensely sick Medicare is financially, and the reason I'm able to do that is because I went lower on the tax cuts that would be rolled back.
SACK: Talk about S-CHIP a little bit. Would you be in favor of sort of unfettered expansion of the program to cover adults as it does in some states now, to raise the eligibility limits way high — some states have tried to do 350-400%?
EDWARDS: Well, what I just suggested is what I would do. When I'm talking S-CHIP being available to families you know of incomes of $50,000 for a family of four that applies to children and adults. I think that's about the place that makes sense.
SACK: Talk about what happens to illegal immigrants under your plan.
EDWARDS: They're not, they're not included in it. By the way, best I can tell, they're not included in anybody's plan. But what I do is reinforce the public health safety net. And that public health safety net will continue to be available to undocumented workers. So that means more funding for public hospitals, more funding for public clinics, basically all the mechanisms by which we provide coverage for people through public health.
SACK: You have dollars attached to that? You know how much you would increase those by?
EDWARDS: I do, but I don't have those in my head right now.
SACK: And I guess one problem there is access, I mean those facilities don't necessarily exist where all the illegal immigrants are.
EDWARDS: I do know that we have proposed as part of this plan an expansion of not just funding for them, but an expansion of the number of facilities too.
SACK: Cost containment. Walk me through the keys to bringing down cost, and I guess start by talking a little bit by talking how your health markets plan would work. And I'm curious how you keep it from being a dumping ground for the sickest patients.
EDWARDS: Because everybody — let's start with the basics — every insurer, and the government, are required to take all comers. So, if you, if you're going to be in the business, this will be done by law, if you're going to be in the business of providing health care coverage, whether you're the government or a private insurer, you are required to cover everybody.
Second, you're required to set premiums based on large groups. In other words, if you have MS, even though they have to cover you, if you don't make clear in the law that the premiums will be set in large groups, they could single you out and say, "Well, we're going to charge you a fortune for your health insurance premiums."
Let me keep going, on the bigger question of how do you reduce costs. So, the big mechanisms for cost containment are, for the private insurers, they have to put 85 cents of every health care dollar into health care, which effectively caps profit and overhead at 15%. For the drug companies, they, we're going to reform the patent system. We're going to make it easier to get generics into the market more quickly. And take a very hard look at drugs that could have a real impact on low and moderate income families, whether instead of providing a patent, we pay a cash award. In other words, instead of creating essentially a monopoly for a period of time, we instead give them a cash award, get the drug on the market more quickly, more available, cheaper. Beyond that, required electronic record keeping. Excuse me, required use of technology, and electronic record keeping.
And then in a bigger-picture way, the whole concept of the system is cradle-to-grave coverage, but not just for when you get really sick. So that we — essentially the idea is this — that from the time children are very young, they're taught nutrition, health, well-being, exercise. When they develop a health care problem, since preventive care is 100% covered, we make sure we intervene, we're monitoring closely, we intervene as early as possible in their health care problem, so that whether they're young or old the patient does not get catastrophically sick. I mean, we know that one of the big problems in our health care system today is people that don't have coverage or who are worried about their coverage just put off getting care because they don't want to incur the expense, and as a result they get catastrophically sick. It's bad for them — bad for the patient — and bad for costs because it drives up costs. So I think the whole concept of preventive care is also an important cost-saving mechanism.
SACK: You've criticized your opponents for being too cozy with the drug and insurance companies, and have suggested that you won't let these big commercial interests in under the tent. So on an issue as complex as this and with such varied approaches, how do you envision putting a coalition together to pass health reform legislation in 2009? Who would your allies be? Could you do it without Republican support, because you're pretty much declaring war on interests that they are allied with?
EDWARDS: Well, I think that there are two things that have to be done simultaneously. One is you have to galvanize America behind the cause. And the most powerful tool the president has is the bully pulpit. And Americans are very receptive to the idea of comprehensive health care reform to begin with. And galvanizing America to create the political support for what needs to be done. That is done simultaneous with reaching out to the leadership of the Congress, both the Democrats and the Republicans, and I do believe there are — I'll give you an example — I had a debate with Newt Gingrich a couple of years ago in California, and the subject of health care came up, and he made a very comprehensive, and I wish I could remember, I believe it was universal, health care proposal. Now it was very different than mine, but he believed, clearly, that some sort of comprehensive health care was needed.
So I think that because of the will that exists today that didn't exist a decade or more ago, I think the public will, bringing America to the cause, and being able to work not just with Democrats but with Republicans, who are hearing the same thing from their constituents that I hear all over this country, I think there's an enormous opportunity. And I think what will ultimately control is first the power of a good idea, second, the political will in America to actually create reform, and third, I think the political leadership of Democratic and Republican, recognize that this is something that's time has come.
SACK: Small businesses are obviously very scared about these mandatory plans. What do you say to reassure them and do you have an idea in mind for the percent of payroll that small businesses should be putting toward health care for their employees?
EDWARDS: Well, what I would say to them is the two greatest beneficiaries of this universal health care proposal are the uninsured and small businesses. Small businesses who are struggling to pay their costs, most of the small businesses — and I've spoken to many all over the country — are terrified about health care costs. They have no market power, they can't negotiate a decent price. It's not just covering their employees, by the way, they can't cover themselves, so it's their own family that's being impacted by this dysfunctional health care system. And so what I say to them, and I've said it repeatedly, is you are an enormous beneficiary of this health care reform that we are proposing. Because what effectively do is give you the same kind of market power that General Motors or IBM or some large American employer has, and because of that you're going to be able to cover yourself, you'll going to be able to cover your employees, and the net result of it is both good for the people who work for you and good for you. So I actually think that small business are among the most — are among those who will benefit most from this proposal.
SACK: You've proposed limiting pharmaceutical advertising. Is that constitutional?
EDWARDS: Yes, if it's done the right way. It has to be done looking very closely at what the First Amendment provides, and what the limits of our authority is to regulate, but yes I think there are reasonable regulations that could be imposed that would, number one, help drive down the cost of some of this drug company advertising. They're spending twice as much on advertising as they are on research and development and, number two, require the disclosure of some information that's not prominently being disclosed today.
SACK: How could it be done constitutionally?
EDWARDS: It has to be done within the frame of what the First Amendment allows and doesn't allow. The First Amendment doesn't allow unfettered free speech. There are limitations on free speech, and we just have to do it within the confines of those limitations.
SACK: Talk a little bit about your malpractice proposal, which I know you have sort of a 3 strikes and you're out proposal for frivolous lawsuits. What would the federal government's ability be to impose those kinds of rules on state courts?
EDWARDS: Well, first of all, most of this is regulated at the state level, as you know, but I think as part of a comprehensive reform if, if, you're saying it like you understand it, but let me walk through it because I want to make sure that …
SACK: That's a good assumption on your part.
EDWARDS: [laughs] Let me walk through what I've actually said, what I have said is that I am not in favor of taking away the rights of patients who have been badly hurt to have their day in court and to have the jury decide their case. I believe in the jury system. What I am in favor of is keeping cases out of the system that don't belong there. And what I would do is say to any lawyer who's considering filing a malpractice case, you must first have the case reviewed by an independent expert, who determines that the case is both meritorious and serious, you have to certify that in order for the case to be filed in the court system, and now we get to the part you made reference to, if you fail to do that then the lawyer will be held financially responsible, and if you do it three times, there's a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule. That's basically what I'm proposing.
SACK: So what would your authority be to impose that in the states? Or is it a bully pulpit issue?
EDWARDS: It can be done either way. I think that actually you do have the constitutional authority to do it nationally. But there's also a good argument to be made that this is traditionally an area that's been left to the states and should be left to the states.
SACK: Last thing.
EDWARDS: And I might add, and I do think that the idea that this is a huge part of health care costs is a complete fantasy. I think it's way less than 1% of health care costs.
SACK: If someone was to know you only by your approach to health care, what would it tell them about your political philosophy on the roles of government and markets and individual rights?
EDWARDS: It would say to them first that I as President would believe we need bold solutions to the country's problems, not timid halfway measures. Secondly, that I believe in responsibility, and my proposal creates individual responsibility, employer responsibility and government responsibility and I think it's that marriage of responsibility that actually works and makes this proposal effective.
SACK: And you guys are insured by the campaign right, the current insurance?
EDWARDS: That's correct.
SACK: Thanks Senator.

Remarks Following the South Carolina Primary

January 26, 2008

Thank you all very much.
I want to join Senator Clinton and President Clinton in congratulating Senator Obama.
Now, the there of us move on to February 5th...
(APPLAUSE)
... where millions of Americans will cast their vote and help shape the future of this party and help shape the future of America.
Our campaign from the very beginning has been about one central thing and that is to give voice to millions of Americans who have absolutely no voice in this democracy, to give voice...
(APPLAUSE)
... to give voice to people like the woman I met in Kansas City a couple of years ago, who told me the story of working full-time and not being able to pay both her heating bill and her rent and having to come home every night in the winter and dress her children in all of their clothes, in their coats, put them under blankets and put them in bed together so they could stay warm.
And she told me the story of getting them up every morning, out of the bed, fully clothed, with their coats on, feeding them and sending them off to school and praying, praying that no one would find out what was happening in her home, because they would come and take her children away from her.
No one should live like that in the United States of America. We are better than that.
(APPLAUSE)
And we are giving voice to that extraordinary woman in Kansas City, admiring her strength and courage. We're giving voice to all those Americans whose voices are not being heard and their voices were heard today in South Carolina.
And so I say if you are worried about your health care or you don't have health care in America, your voice will be heard in this campaign. If...
(APPLAUSE)
... you are worried, worried because you've lost your job and you're worried sick about finding a new job, your voice will be heard in this campaign.
If you're one of 37 million Americans who wake up every single day literally worried about feeding and clothing your children and living in poverty, your voice will be heard in America and it will be heard in this campaign and we will speak for you and we will fight for you.
(APPLAUSE)
If you're worried about being able to pay for your child to be able to go to college, being able to pay for tuition and books, your voice will be heard in this campaign and it will be heard in America. (APPLAUSE)
And if you're one of the forgotten middle class, people who are working and struggling just to pay their bills, literally worried about every single day, we will give you voice in this campaign.
And last, if you are one of the extraordinary men and women who have served this country patriotically and worn the uniform of the United States of America and you're not getting the health care that you deserve and you need or if you're one of 200,000 veterans who live in this country, who, every night, go to sleep under bridges or in shelters or on grates, as long as we are alive and breathing, your voice will be heard in this campaign and it will be heard in America.
(APPLAUSE)
And then -- and then, finally, if you're one of the millions of Americans who have yet to cast your vote in this democratic process, beginning on February 5th and moving beyond, your voice will be heard and we will be there with you every single step of the way.
Join us in this movement. Join in this campaign. Let's make America what it's capable of being.
God bless you all and thank you for your support and thank you for being here and thank you for your voice.
(APPLAUSE)

Remarks Announcing the End of Presidential Campaign Activities

January 30, 2008

Thank you all very much. We're very proud to be back here.
During the spring of 2006, I had the extraordinary experience of bringing 700 college kids here to New Orleans to work. These are kids who gave up their spring break to come to New Orleans to work, to rehabilitate houses, because of their commitment as Americans, because they believed in what was possible, and because they cared about their country.
I began my presidential campaign here to remind the country that we, as citizens and as a government, have a moral responsibility to each other, and what we do together matters. We must do better, if we want to live up to the great promise of this country that we all love so much.
It is appropriate that I come here today. It's time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path. We do not know who will take the final steps to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but what we do know is that our Democratic Party will make history. We will be strong, we will be unified, and with our convictions and a little backbone we will take back the White House in November and we'll create hope and opportunity for this country.
This journey of ours began right here in New Orleans. It was a December morning in the Lower Ninth Ward when people went to work, not just me, but lots of others went to work with shovels and hammers to help restore a house that had been destroyed by the storm.
We joined together in a city that had been abandoned by our government and had been forgotten, but not by us. We knew that they still mourned the dead, that they were still stunned by the destruction, and that they wondered when all those cement steps in all those vacant lots would once again lead to a door, to a home, and to a dream.
We came here to the Lower Ninth Ward to rebuild. And we're going to rebuild today and work today, and we will continue to come back. We will never forget the heartache and we'll always be here to bring them hope, so that someday, one day, the trumpets will sound in Musicians' Village, where we are today, play loud across Lake Ponchartrain, so that working people can come marching in and those steps once again can lead to a family living out the dream in America.
We sat with poultry workers in Mississippi, janitors in Florida, nurses in California.
We listened as child after child told us about their worry about whether we would preserve the planet.
We listened to worker after worker say "the economy is tearing my family apart."
We walked the streets of Cleveland, where house after house was in foreclosure.
And we said, "We're better than this. And economic justice in America is our cause."
And we spent a day, a summer day, in Wise, Virginia, with a man named James Lowe, who told us the story of having been born with a cleft palate. He had no health care coverage. His family couldn't afford to fix it. And finally some good Samaritan came along and paid for his cleft palate to be fixed, which allowed him to speak for the first time. But they did it when he was 50 years old. His amazing story, though, gave this campaign voice: universal health care for every man, woman and child in America. That is our cause.
And we do this -- we do this for each other in America. We don't turn away from a neighbor in their time of need. Because every one of us knows that what -- but for the grace of God, there goes us. The American people have never stopped doing this, even when their government walked away, and walked away it has from hardworking people, and, yes, from the poor, those who live in poverty in this country.
For decades, we stopped focusing on those struggles. They didn't register in political polls, they didn't get us votes and so we stopped talking about it. I don't know how it started. I don't know when our party began to turn away from the cause of working people, from the fathers who were working three jobs literally just to pay the rent, mothers sending their kids to bed wrapped up in their clothes and in coats because they couldn't afford to pay for heat.
We know that our brothers and sisters have been bullied into believing that they can't organize and can't put a union in the workplace. Well, in this campaign, we didn't turn our heads. We looked them square in the eye and we said, "We see you, we hear you, and we are with you. And we will never forget you." And I have a feeling that if the leaders of our great Democratic Party continue to hear the voices of working people, a proud progressive will occupy the White House.
Now, I've spoken to both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama. They have both pledged to me and more importantly through me to America, that they will make ending poverty central to their campaign for the presidency.
And more importantly, they have pledged to me that as President of the United States they will make ending poverty and economic inequality central to their Presidency. This is the cause of my life and I now have their commitment to engage in this cause.
And I want to say to everyone here, on the way here today, we passed under a bridge that carried the interstate where 100 to 200 homeless Americans sleep every night. And we stopped, we got out, we went in and spoke to them.
There was a minister there who comes every morning and feeds the homeless out of her own pocket. She said she has no money left in her bank account, she struggles to be able to do it, but she knows it's the moral, just and right thing to do. And I spoke to some of the people who were there and as I was leaving, one woman said to me, "You won't forget us, will you? Promise me you won't forget us." Well, I say to her and I say to all of those who are struggling in this country, we will never forget you. We will fight for you. We will stand up for you.
But I want to say this -- I want to say this because it's important. With all of the injustice that we've seen, I can say this, America's hour of transformation is upon us. It may be hard to believe when we have bullets flying in Baghdad and it may be hard to believe when it costs $58 to fill your car up with gas. It may be hard to believe when your school doesn't have the right books for your kids. It's hard to speak out for change when you feel like your voice is not being heard.
But I do hear it. We hear it. This Democratic Party hears you. We hear you, once again. And we will lift you up with our dream of what's possible.
One America, one America that works for everybody.
One America where struggling towns and factories come back to life because we finally transformed our economy by ending our dependence on oil.
One America where the men who work the late shift and the women who get up at dawn to drive a two-hour commute and the young person who closes the store to save for college. They will be honored for that work.
One America where no child will go to bed hungry because we will finally end the moral shame of 37 million people living in poverty.
One America where every single man, woman and child in this country has health care.
One America with one public school system that works for all of our children.
One America that finally brings this war in Iraq to an end. And brings our service members home with the hero's welcome that they have earned and that they deserve.
Today, I am suspending my campaign for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency.
But I want to say this to everyone: with Elizabeth, with my family, with my friends, with all of you and all of your support, this son of a millworker's gonna be just fine. Our job now is to make certain that America will be fine.
And I want to thank everyone who has worked so hard - all those who have volunteered, my dedicated campaign staff who have worked absolutely tirelessly in this campaign.
And I want to say a personal word to those I've seen literally in the last few days - those I saw in Oklahoma yesterday, in Missouri, last night in Minnesota - who came to me and said don't forget us. Speak for us. We need your voice. I want you to know that you almost changed my mind, because I hear your voice, I feel you, and your cause it our cause. Your country needs you - every single one of you.
All of you who have been involved in this campaign and this movement for change and this cause, we need you. It is in our hour of need that your country needs you. Don't turn away, because we have not just a city of New Orleans to rebuild. We have an American house to rebuild.
This work goes on. It goes on right here in Musicians' Village. There are homes to build here, and in neighborhoods all along the Gulf. The work goes on for the students in crumbling schools just yearning for a chance to get ahead. It goes on for day care workers, for steel workers risking their lives in cities all across this country. And the work goes on for two hundred thousand men and women who wore the uniform of the United States of America, proud veterans, who go to sleep every night under bridges, or in shelters, or on grates, just as the people we saw on the way here today. Their cause is our cause.
Their struggle is our struggle. Their dreams are our dreams.
Do not turn away from these great struggles before us. Do not give up on the causes that we have fought for. Do not walk away from what's possible, because it's time for all of us, all of us together, to make the two Americas one.
Thank you. God bless you, and let's go to work. Thank you all very much.
