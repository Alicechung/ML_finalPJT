Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Waterloo, Iowa

June 27, 2011

It's great to be in Iowa and even better to be in Waterloo where I was born. It's fitting to be here at the Snowden House, the place that once served as the home of the Waterloo Women's Club. I stand here today in front of many friends and family to formally announce my candidacy for President of the United States. I do so because I am grateful for the blessings God and this country have given to me, and not because of the position of the office, but because I am determined that every American deserves these blessings and that together we can once again strengthen America and restore the promise of the future. I want to bring a voice, your voice, to the White House, just as I have brought your voice to the halls of congress to secure the promise of the future for our generation and generations to come.
I often say that everything I needed to know I learned in Iowa. It was at Hawthorne and Valley Park Elementary Schools and my home, both a short distance from here, where those Iowan roots were firmly planted. It's those roots and my faith in God that guide me today. I'm a descendent of generations Iowans. I know what it means to be from Iowa — what we value and what's important. Those are the values that helped make Iowa the breadbasket of the world and those are the values, the best of all of us that we must recapture to secure the promise of the future.
Waterloo was different five decades ago when I grew up here. That elementary school building was a lot younger and for that matter so was I. Five decades ago when I went there to school the halls were teeming with young children who, like me, had dreams of their future. A future with promise and parents who wanted it to be filled with more opportunities than they had. Five decades ago America had less debt, in fact our national debt was less than 300 billion dollars. A gallon of gasoline was 31 cents, and owning a home was part of living the American dream. Today our debt is over 14 trillion dollars, a gallon of gas is still outrageously high, millions of homes are in foreclosure, and those dreams are distant for many Americans.
Times have changed here in Waterloo, but the people still have the same spirit we Iowans have come to exemplify. We work hard, we live within our means and we expect to pass on a better life to our children. But our government keeps getting bigger making it tougher for us to pass on that life, causing our jobs to go overseas and spending more of the money we make, while we keep less of it.
Don't mistake my happy memories of growing up in Waterloo as pining for the past. I recognize it's impossible to turn the clock back and go back to a different day. Instead, I want this moment to serve as a reminder about the best of who we are as a nation, what our values are, and what went in to making America great to capture its best for the promise of the future. I want my candidacy for the presidency to stand for the moment when "we the people" reclaimed our independence from a government that has gotten too big, spends too much and has taken away too much of our liberty.
Americans have always confronted challenges. Ours is a history marked by struggles as well as prosperity. My early days were difficult as they were for many Americans, especially during the time when my mother struggled to raise us after divorce. But we made our own way. We depended on our neighbors and ourselves and not our government for help. We trusted in God and our neighbors and not in Government. Americans still have that same spirit. But government keeps trying to erase it because government thinks it knows better — that government can create jobs, and make a better life for all of us, even make us healthier! But that's NOT the case. We have to recapture our founders' vision of a constitutionally conservative government if we are to secure the promise of the future.
I'm also here because Waterloo laid the foundation for my own roots in politics. I never thought that I would end up in public life. I grew up here in Iowa. My grandparents are buried here. I remember how sad I was leaving Iowa to go to Minnesota in the sixth grade, because this part of Iowa was all I knew — I remember telling my parents that we couldn't move to Minnesota because I hadn't even been to Des Moines to see the state capitol.
I grew up a democrat. My first involvement in politics was working for Jimmy Carter's election in 1976. But when I saw the direction President Carter took our country; how his big spending liberal majority grew government, weakened our standing in the world, and how they decreased our liberties, I became a Republican. I remember standing in the kitchen of my grandma's house on Lafayette Street in Waterloo listening to my dad, a Democrat debating the merits of the Great Society with my grandmother, a Republican. I remember her prophetic admonition to my father that the Great Society wouldn't work because it wouldn't be my father's generation who paid for it, but rather my brother, David and me. And now that prediction has come true and neither my democrat father nor my republican grandmother would have condoned this spending and debt.
I hadn't planned on getting into politics. I loved the law and went to law school. I went on to William and Mary to become a tax lawyer. Together with my husband we started a successful small business.
When I saw the problems with our local school district and how academic excellence was being eroded by federal government interference with the local schools, I decided to do more than just complain about it. One of those Iowa values instilled in me was to always leave whatever you were involved with better than when you found it, so I decided to seek public office to make our local school district better. I didn't seek public office for fortune or power, but simply to make life better in our community and education better for our children. And now I seek the presidency not for vanity, but because America is at a crucial moment and I believe that we must make a bold choice if we are to secure the promise of the future.
We cannot continue to kick the can of our problems down the road, because they are problems of today and not tomorrow.
We cannot continue to rack up debt on the backs of future generations.
We can't afford an unconstitutional health plan that costs too much and is worth so little.
And we can't afford four more years of failed leadership at home and abroad.
We can't afford four more years of millions of Americans out of work or in jobs that pay too little to support their families.
We can't afford four more years of a housing crisis that is devaluing our homes and making home ownership impossible for many Americans.
We can't afford four more years of a foreign policy that leads from behind and doesn't stand up for our friends and stand up to our enemies.
We can't afford four more years of Barack Obama.
As a constitutional conservative, I believe in the Founding Father's vision of a limited government that trusts in and preserves the unlimited potential of the American people. I don't believe that the solutions to our problems come from Washington: more than ever, Washington IS the problem, and the real solutions will come from our businesses, our communities, our schools and the most basic and powerful unit of all-our families.
We've started another campaign season, almost when it seemed like the last one just ended. Through all of the rancor of the campaign, let us always remember that there is much more that unites us than divides us. Our problems don't have an identity of party, they are problems created by both parties.
Americans agree that our country is in peril today and we must act with urgency to save it. And Americans aren't interested in affiliation; they are interested in solutions, and leadership that will tell the truth. And the truth is that Americans ARE the solution and not the government!
This election is about big issues, not petty ones. When all is said and done, we cannot be about big government as usual. Then America will lose.
In Washington I am bringing a voice to the halls of congress that has been missing for a long time. It is the voice of the people I love and learned from growing up in Waterloo. It is the voice of reasonable, fair-minded people who love this country, who are patriotic, and who see the United States as the indispensable nation of the world.
My voice is part of a movement to take back our country, and now I want to take that voice to the White House. It is the voice of constitutional conservatives who want our government to do its job and not ours and who want our government to live within its means and not our children's and grandchildren's.
I am here in Waterloo, Iowa to announce today: We can win in 2012 and we will. Our voice has been growing louder and stronger. And it is made up of Americans from all walks of life like a three-legged stool. It's the peace through strength Republicans, and I'm one of them, it's fiscal conservatives, and I'm one of them, and it's social conservatives, and I'm one of them. It's the Tea Party movement and I'm one of them.
The liberals, and to be clear I'm NOT one of them, want you to think the Tea Party is the Right Wing of the Republican Party. But it's not. It's made up of disaffected Democrats, independents, people who've never been political a day in their life, libertarians, Republicans. We're people who simply want America back on the right track again.
We're practical people who want the country to work again. This is a powerful coalition the left fears, and they should because, Make no mistake about it, President Obama is a one-term president!
In February 2009 President Obama was very confident that his economic policies would turn the country around within a year. He said, "A year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." Well Mr. President, your policies haven't worked. Spending our way out of this recession hasn't worked. And so Mr. President We Take You at Your Word!
Waterloo holds a special place for me, but also holds a special place for our country. You sent and still do send your sons and daughters off to fight for America and to protect the freedoms that allow us to gather here today. I honor my dad who served in the United States Air Force. I honor my step dad who served in the United States Army. And I honor my stepbrother who retired full United States Navy. We will never forget those sacrifices; it is part of our past we must remember to secure the promise of the future. It is those values that make our country unique and make us the most powerful force for good on this planet. I believe the United States of America is THE indispensible nation. It is that spirit that separates us from those who would give their own life for others from those who sacrifice others, like terrorists who use little children as human shields.
Perhaps the valor of our American fighting heroes was never captured better than in the sacrifice made by the Sullivan brothers from right here in Waterloo. The Sullivan family was much like other families in America during the depression. They were fortunate to get by. Most of the family worked here in Waterloo at the local meat packing plant. When a close friend of the family died at Pearl Harbor, the five Sullivan brothers enlisted in the Navy, but under the condition that they be allowed to serve together. One of the brothers wrote, "We will make a team together that can't be beat." Born and raised here in Waterloo, the five Sullivan brothers had always stuck together. However, one fateful morning after a long night of intense battle, a Japanese torpedo struck the USS Juneau, the ship on which they served killing most of the crew and launching the rest into the water. The oldest of the Sullivans, George, searched tirelessly for his brothers, but they were not to be found. He had survived the attack, but later perished at sea. All but 10 of the 697 brave men of the Juneau, gave their lives for their country. In spite of the intense pain of losing their five sons all at once, the parents of the Sullivans became an inspiration to America speaking to millions on behalf of the war effort. To honor the Sullivans two ships were named for them. The motto of the last ship — We Stick Together!
Theirs was a demonstration of the Holy Scriptures that says: "Greater love hath no man than this, but that he lay down his life for his friend."
That is the kind of love we Americans have for our country. We Americans stick together. We triumph together. In the words of Daniel Webster, we are, "One cause, one country, one heart." That is the kind of commitment it will take to face the great challenges of today. The people of this great country have that level of courage and they are longing for a President who will listen to them, who will lead from the front, and not from behind.
I'm Michele Bachmann and I'm running for President of the United States.
Together, we can do this. Together we can reign in all the corruption and waste that has become Washington and instead leave a better America for future generations.
Together we can make a team that can't be beat!
Together we can secure the promise of the future.
Together we can - and together we will!
God bless you and God bless the United States of America!

Remarks in Response to President Obama's Address to a Joint Address to Congress

September 8, 2011

Unfortunately, it seems, every time the President speaks, his policies have cost the American people jobs and future prosperity.
Tonight the President under the veil of one of the most sacred deliberative forums, a joint session of Congress, delivered another political speech where he doubled down on more of the same policies that are killing the economy.
Mr. President, what among your proposals was new? What here hasn't already been tried and failed before?
While the President's speech comes on the heels of a trillion dollars of failed stimulus, bailouts, and temporary gimmicks aimed at creating jobs, the President continued to cling to the idea that government is the solution to creating jobs.
My conservative colleagues and I have been fighting over the last two and half years for pro growth policies.
I stand here tonight to say to the President, not only should Congress not pass your plan, I say, "stop; your last plan hasn't worked, it's hurting the American economy." Instead of temporary fixes, do what has proved to work in the past, permanent pro growth policies that are driven by the free market."
Today, unemployment is 9.1 percent. Job creation has literally been zeroed out with the worst jobs report in 66 years this last month. Since the President's failed trillion dollar stimulus we have lost over 2.5 million jobs while adding 416,000 government jobs. One in six Americans is now on food stamps, and the average time unemployed Americans are out of work is greater than 40 weeks. Housing values have fallen 19% from 2008 to the first quarter of this year. GDP growth was an anemic .4% in the first quarter and at 1% in the last and the dollar has lost 12 percent of its value.
These are not good times for the American people. Our patience for speeches, gimmicks and excuses has run out.
The only remedies the President knows are temporary, government directed fixes. And even if the President's plan passes, we already know it will fail. In practice, we haven't paid for his last trillion dollar jobs program and now his latest plan would have us embrace potentially over $400 billion in new government spending!
Spending taxpayer dollars on extending unemployment benefits has proved to add only 25 cents to GDP for every dollar we spend. Even the President's new economic advisor agrees that extending unemployment benefits discourages future employment. Spending taxpayer dollars on extending the payroll tax holiday will reduce over 111 billion dollars to the Social Security trust fund this year and continuation of this policy will put social security checks to seniors at even greater risk. Spending taxpayer dollars on more infrastructure projects failed to create lasting jobs in the last stimulus.
And, looming on the horizon is the full scale implementation of Obamacare that, according the Congressional Budget Office, will kill 800,000 jobs and steal over 500 billion from Medicare.
Candidate Obama promised to wipe out deficits and the debt. Instead the President has increased the debt by over 6 trillion dollars, and what do we have to show for it? Permanent increases in the size of government, spending and debt, with a greater dependency on government.
Four years ago President Bush's deficit was around 160 billion dollars; today, President Obama's is nearly ten times that amount.
The President and Vice-President's plan to spend us to prosperity has failed. And worse, they have stolen from a generation of Americans yet unborn, the consequences of which mean a near certainty of reduced choices and a dramatically downsized lifestyle for future generations from what we enjoy today.
Generational theft is a moral and ethical issue, and I care deeply about both the present generation and generations to come.
The President is politically paralyzed and philosophically incapable of doing what needs to be done.
I do agree, the President should take immediate action. But it is the nine following steps that will put us on a path to economic growth and put Americans back to work;
1) Repatriate American business dollars earned from overseas,
2) Massively cut spending and the size of government,
3) Repeal Obamacare, which is the government takeover of America's healthcare system,
4) Cut taxes, including corporate taxes,
5) Repeal Dodd-Frank,
6) Repeal job killing regulations,
7) Increase exports by finalizing free trade agreements,
8) Spur new investment in America, inspire innovation,
9) Provide job creating energy solutions, including decreased regulations on developing new energy supplies from our abundant domestic energy resources.
The way forward needs to be based on permanent solutions grounded in the private sector. That is how we will once again restore economic prosperity to our country.
God Bless the United States of America.

Remarks at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.

October 7, 2011

Hi, everyone. Good to see you. Hi, everybody. Good to see you. Thank you so much.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you.
REP. BACHMANN: I love you too. And besides that, you're all extremely good looking, so we're all good friends.
Thank you so much for welcoming me back here to the Family Research Council. Hasn't this been a wonderful summit? [cheers and applause] I want to thank Tony Perkins. I want to thank the Family Research Council, all the sponsoring organizations that have been involved in this event. It really is an honor for me to be able to be back here in Washington, D.C. to speak to all of you tonight, here in the twilight of the Obama administration. [cheers and applause] Oh, believe it's going to happen. It is going to happen.
My husband, Marcus, and I are just so delighted. We've been married for 33 wonderful years last month. [applause] Over the years, God gave us five wonderful children that we have raised to know the Lord. They now walk with the Lord. They're all grown, gone, out of the house. And we've also had the thrill to raise 23 great foster children in our home over the years as well. We've raised 23—28 wonderful children. And you are looking at the old woman in the shoe right here. [applause]
I also appreciate other parents too when they describe their sense of passing on their values to the next generation, to their children. And one that I love in particular is one of my all-time favorite founding fathers. That would be John Adams. And I've read some of the letters that he's written to his wife Abigail, some of the letters she wrote to him. And in one particular letter in 1780, John Adams wrote this to his wife, and he said, "I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music and architecture."
Now, that's a short passage, but it says so much. And in particular, I think it is relevant to this evening and this day and time that we live in, because he recognized, as we must, that there are critical times in our history, critical times when a generation is required to set aside the pursuits that we would all like to have and instead embrace the sacrifices that are necessary to secure liberty to the next generation.
And I want to say to you tonight that all of us that are here, we were all created for a time such as this. [applause] We saw it happen, didn't we, with Adams' generation, when the founders put everything on the line for us, that we owe everything that we have, not only to the sacrifice that they gave for their life, but also for their property, because the kind of government that they gave to us was one that they founded on the consent of us, the people. And it was one that was dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal and that we are endowed by one creator with certain inalienable rights. That's our American creed. [cheers and applause]
And we've seen that sacrifice continue through every generation in the United States. We saw that continue in the last generation, with the greatest generation in the Second World War and in the First World War, fighting on two fronts for the future, not only of just us in the United States, but we can never forget that they also fought for our brethren across the world.
And I believe that now, as in the time of Washington and Adams and of Jefferson, that we are again facing an absolutely extraordinary challenge, never before seen in the history of our nation, a challenge of debt, and a challenge that will require ordinary men and women, just like ourselves, to unite in determination to do extraordinary things in our day.
We all know the challenges that we face. Millions of our fellow Americans, unfortunately, today are unemployed, and all too many are underemployed. Deficit spending under President Obama has absolutely skyrocketed, and he has left the rest of us to pay for his bills.
Gas prices have doubled. Do you know that Barack Obama, the day he took office, gasoline was $1.79 a gallon? Oh, how we long for that day. The good news is we can have that day again. And President Obama has moved—[applause]—oh, yes. And President Obama has moved the fight over abortion to "Obamacare." It's a venue where he has a new, never before seen, stunning level of power in his hand as the president and where we aren't even left the right of appeal from a government leviathan.
China's growth and influence is spreading unchecked across the world. Increasingly it's apparent that Russia's commitment to power exceeds its commitment to the value of human life.
But the challenges that we face aren't the entire story, because we are fighting back. [cheers and applause] We are fighting back as a grassroots movement that's renewed the promise of our constitutional heritage. And that movement is known nationwide as the tea party movement. [cheers and applause]
And I say and attest to you here this evening, that movement, united with the pro-family movement, the Republican Party, with disaffected Democrats, with independents, with people who have never been political a day in their life, I attest to you, this united movement will deliver the victory in 2012. [cheers and applause]
We are fighting back against the out-of-control government spending. We are fighting back with renewed pressure on our government at every level, which is why I led the fight last summer against raising the debt ceiling and giving Barack Obama another $2.4 trillion in borrowed money to spend now, and it will only get us through till next year. That was the right fight to fight, and you joined in that fight. [cheers and applause]
We're fighting back with a movement that is demanding nothing less than the full-scale repeal of "Obamacare"—[cheers and applause]—because we know what the government takeover of medicine—in fact, let's call what it is, socialized medicine—we know that we can never again be prosperous and truly free in this country if socialized medicine remains the law of the land. You have my commitment. It will be repealed. [cheers and applause]
We are fighting back. And I was very proud to help lead that fight when, in November of 2010, the American people overwhelmingly came to the polls and we took more seats away from the president's party than had been taken away in a midterm election in over 70 years. And we're just getting started. [cheers and applause]
And together we fought back when the American people replaced six business-as-usual U.S. senators, and we replaced them with six constitutional U.S. senators. And we're just getting started there as well. [cheers and applause]
I'm one hard-working woman. And I want you to know, as nominee of the Republican Party, I will not quit unless I help elect 13 more like-minded, titanium-spined, new U.S. senators to join me in the U.S. Senate. [cheers and applause] And we can do it. Don't think we can't. [cheers and applause] We'll do it.
I'm not interested in going to the Oval Office just to be tied up in knots for four years. The only reason I would go to the Oval Office is to actually do what needs to be done—repeal "Obamacare," repeal Dodd-Frank, change the tax code, get the country on the right track. And the only way we can do that is by having a filibuster-proof Senate and a conservative majority in the House of Representatives. And it will be 100 days like you have never seen before. [cheers and applause]
We'll ask the Brits if they would kindly give us back that statue of Winston Churchill to put in the Oval Office. [cheers and applause] We will dust off the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights, and they will be front and center on my wall and on my desk in the Oval Office. And then I will kindly show every czar to the door and let them know they won't be hearing from me again—[cheers and applause]—because we're going to keep fighting back until we take back the White House in 2012. And I just want you to know, I am ready and prepared to lead that fight. [applause]
And as dear John Adams said, in times of crisis, we are obliged to study politics and war. And the first decade of this century, unfortunately, has seen all too much of our share of war in this country. And I say to you this evening that our men and our women in uniform have performed absolutely brilliantly. [cheers and applause] We love our military. We honor our military. We admire our military. We respect our military.
They have laid tyrants low and they have terminated the lives not only of Osama bin Laden, but also one week ago today they ended the life of Awlaki, who was the mastermind behind the Christmas Day underwear bomber, behind the Fort Hood disasters, behind the Fort Dix six, and also behind the cargo bombs that were intended—that were sent to Chicago. Our brave men and women did this for us. [cheers and applause]
Unfortunately, as a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, we deal with the nation's classified secrets. I wish that I could tell you that those threats are now behind us. Those threats remain as great or greater than they ever have before. But by now I believe it is obvious that we have the perseverance to see this fight through against radical Islamic jihadists. And the American soldier has no equal when it comes to force of arms.
So we know about war. But what about politics? And why did John Adams, in his remarks, group the two of these together? Because our political opponents are not military opponents, and what John Adams recognized, and what has become all too apparent since 2008, is that there are times when events reach a tipping point or a decision point.
And it's at those times, I believe, when a country needs citizens like all of us in this arena tonight who are willing to fight not only for our political freedom and all of the intensity, with all of the dedication, with all the willingness to sacrifice that we've come to associate with our soldiers who guard our shores, because this evening here at the Values Voter Summit, I believe that America is at our generational decision point, because the decisions that we are about to embark on in the next few months in this nation, we will choose the next leader of our country and we will choose the direction and we will determine whether we will grow the economy or whether we will watch it slip back into a recession that has the potential for becoming potentially a worldwide recession, and even, some say, a depression.
The decisions that we will make are sobering. They will determine whether we remain the country with the highest quality of medical care in the world or whether our government will run new drugs, new medical devices, new medical procedures out of this country, as it is doing today.
That isn't America, and that must change—[applause]—because, you see, these decisions that we are about to make will determine whether America remains the world's leading economic superpower, as we are today, or whether the United States will be eclipsed and we will become a secondary economic superpower within five years, as the International Monetary Fund has already predicted.
If the International Monetary Fund is right and we don't choose the next president of the United States as one who is committed to doing the very difficult sacrificial things that must be done, then this could be—and we must ponder well—this could be the last election when the United States is the greatest economic superpower of the world. And that means the last military superpower of the world. I reject that plan—[applause]—because, as your president, I fully intend to fight to retain our status as the economic and military superpower of the world, as Ronald Reagan choose to do in the 1980s.
Ronald Reagan understood all too well, America could not win the war against the Soviet Union unless we were the predominant economic superpower of the world. Barack Obama has put this nation on a course so dangerous economically that it could impact necessarily and diminish our military impact across the world as well.
What do we have to do to retain this economic super status? It will require sacrifice. But we must. We must drastically cut government spending. We are spending 40 percent more than what we take in. [applause] I am up for that challenge. [applause]
We must overhaul America's welfare dependency programs. We must. I am up for that challenge. And we must create a pro-growth economic climate of permanent solutions in the private sector, as opposed to government-directed temporary gimmicks like this current president has proposed all along and dares to call it a jobs plan.
We must repeal "Obamacare." I introduced the bill, and I will. We must defeat and repeal Dodd-Frank, which is doing to the financial sector what "Obamacare" is doing to health care. [applause] I introduced that bill, and I will. And we must begin at the easiest place to have job creation; that is, legalize American energy production. This is our ticket to prosperity. [cheers and applause]
Even the government—the Congressional Research Service has told us America is the number one energy resource-rich nation in the world. There is no reason for us to go begging to other nations. There's no reason for us—[cheers and applause]—there is no reason for us to enrich the Middle East dictator thugs of the world. There is no reason. [cheers and applause] There was no reason for Barack Obama to give a $2 billion check to the Brazilians and say we will be your best customers. There was no reason. [applause]
When the Chinese are dragging an oil rig to place 50 miles outside of Florida in waters that they are leasing from Cuba, we can drill here and we can drill now in the United States of America. [cheers and applause] As your president, I will legalize American energy production. We will be drilling. We will be fracking. We will be leasing. We will be opening up American energy production. And we will be the leader in the world in American energy, and the American people will be better off for it. [applause]
We also have a tremendous opportunity before us for reduction. And this is how I want it to have reduction. I will permanently shut down the Department of Education. [cheers and applause] And as soon as I lock the doors and turn off the lights to the Department of Education, I will get in my car and get to the department of EPA to do the same to them. [cheers and applause]
It may be a long day, but there's a few others that are also going to get their lights off. [cheers and applause] Trust me. It will be done. In other words, this is our chance. This is our chance, men and women. We have the chance to once again choose greatness. And as Charles Krauthammer wrote in his great essay, we are privileged to choose. Choose greatness or choose decline.
As I look at all of you this evening, I know what you have chosen. You've chosen greatness. You have chosen to go on. Every day across the United States, I haven't met one American who wants to choose decline. And this president has chosen decline for this nation. That's not our future. Our future will be determined in 2012.
And if that's what you want, I am ready to lead that fight as the next president of the United States of America—[cheers and applause]—because I have no interest in managing an unmanageable, dysfunctional, lethargic bureaucracy. My goal is to dismantle it—[cheers and applause]—because, you see, these decisions we're about to make will determine whether we move forward under a federal government of enumerated powers that acts within its constitutional limitations—what a concept—or instead if we accept an absolutely uncontrollable government monster whose reach is only limited by the imagination of those who hold power, because most important of all, the decisions that we make are going to determine whether we have a Supreme Court that respects its constitutional role and respects our guaranteed rights to life and liberty and property that are guaranteed in the Constitution, or instead if we will have a Supreme Court that will be undermining all of those values and then abdicate their duty to interpret the Constitution as written by the founders, not as resolved by The New York Times. [applause]
And yet, with the stakes as high as they have ever been in our lifetimes, I'm here to deliver to you very good news, because, of all years, this is the year when we conservatives don't have to settle. [cheers and applause] This is not the election to choose a moderate or a compromise candidate. Now is not the time to abandon our values and virtues, because now is the time when we need those virtues more than ever.
As I told you, every day I'm traveling across this great country, meeting people all over the country. I can tell you first-hand the cake is already baked. The people have said no to Barack Obama. They're ready to say yes to someone who will clearly stand apart, someone who will stand up against the ever-growing power of this bureaucracy, who has the will to do what they say they're going to do, and do what they say they're going to do.
Conservatives, we can have it all this year, because Barack Obama will be a one-term president. [cheers and applause]
Don't listen to these people who every four years tell you we have to select a moderate from our party and we have to settle for the sake of winning. I am here to tell you, we are going to win, not—this year we don't settle. We're going to win the White House. So let's finally have one of us in the White House. [cheers and applause]
I have lived a consistent life based on core convictions, and I have proven time after time that I stand with you and I stand for our values and I stand for the Constitution. I stand for limited government. I stand on principle. And I will never back down. [cheers and applause]
You won't find YouTube clips of me speaking in support of Roe versus Wade. You won't find me equivocating or hemming or hawing when I'm asked to define marriage as between one man and one woman. [applause] And you won't find me tagged as a crony capitalist, paying off big political donors with big political favors. And you won't have to worry about me stepping one toe out of the United States, apologizing for the United States of America on foreign soil. [cheers and applause] And you will never have to worry whether I will stand and defend our ally, Israel, because I do and I have. [cheers and applause]
You won't have to worry about these things, because for five years in Washington, D.C., I have lived, I have breathed, I have fought daily in the halls of Congress for our shared values. And the reason our agenda never seems to advance is because the people that we send to represent us rarely, if ever, fight for us after everything that we do and sacrifice to get them elected. The only reason that I came to Washington was to fight for our nonnegotiable principles. And remember, we can't win if we don't fight. [cheers and applause]
People said it would never be done, but in Minnesota I fought for seven years and persevered, and we won the issue of defining marriage as one man and one woman. And it will be on the ballot in the state of Minnesota in 2012—[cheers and applause]—because, you see, with a proven fighter in the White House, we will finally win on the issue of life, on marriage, on family, on religious liberty. It's time that we score some victories for our movement. [applause]
On a personal level, the most important issue that I made and the most important stand that I made in life was not to settle for religious practice. When I was 16 years of age, I chose to select a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and I stand with him—[cheers and applause]—I stand with Jesus Christ because he, first of all, stood for me. And he wishes to stand with all men as well.
From the time I can remember, when I was small, my parents prayed with me. They prayed with my three brothers. And, by the way, for girls, that's the best preparation for politics you can ever have, three brothers, just so you know; no sisters. My parents helped me to become a woman of prayer. And, like you, I consult the Lord through prayer on almost every decision that I make.
But I realized my need for a savior after my parents were divorced and we moved to the state of Minnesota. And even though I hadn't been a drinker or done drugs or were chasing around or doing what you call bad things, it didn't matter. I was still a sinner, and I was still in need of a savior. And I knew that I needed to radically abandon myself and my life and my future to Jesus Christ.
And that's the stand that has helped to develop my core of conviction. And how can I stand for what I believe with conviction? How can you stand? How can we stand with confidence in defense of these values, in defense of the virtues that have made the United States of America great? Well, John Adams was a Christian, and John Adams had a deep understanding of the indispensable role that faith and religion and morality play in the moral fabric of our nation. And this understanding ran so deep in our country.
It was understood to play such a fundamental role in self-governance that John Adams understood that the morals we live by and the faith that we have, the values and the virtues that we depend on, were fully intertwined in every area of our lives that shape our families, our culture and our government.
And when we advocate in favor of lower taxes and fewer regulations and in order to—and in order to create more jobs, the reason why we do this is not just for the sake of our back-pocket—our back-pocket wallet or our pocketbook. That isn't why we do it alone. But it's because we recognize there's a moral obligation to bring our fellow citizens into what Pope John Paul II called the circle of productivity and exchange, because, you see, free markets also have morality. Free markets help mankind. And I am unashamed apologist for free markets. [applause]
When we argue for choosing our own health care rather than government control in health care, we do it not only because of the failed results of a state-run health care bureaucracy that we see in other countries, but we do it because we believe that we are the ones who get to choose our own care and that of our loved ones.
And when we speak in defense of traditional marriage, it isn't because we want to control other people's lives. It's because we recognize the deep roots of natural law and of revealed law and other religious traditions that have united across the centuries, and in the shared belief that it was a holy God who designed marriage for man and woman as the most loving and best environment for the procreation of children. [cheers and applause]
And when we fight for the right to life from conception until natural death, we do it not only because we recognize that the protection of innocent life is the most fundamental obligation of any government, but because we believe that each person—man, woman, black, white, no matter the economic circumstance—are all made in the image and sacred likeness of a holy God. That's the reason. [cheers and applause]
My personal life experience has shown me how precious life is. And that's why yesterday I was privileged to introduce a bill into the House of Representatives called the Heartbeat Informed Consent Act, because, you see, I believe it's important that mothers, when they go to an abortion clinic, have the opportunity to hear their baby's heartbeat and see their baby's heartbeat on an ultrasound machine. We're told of undecided women, once they see that baby's heartbeat or hear that baby's heartbeat, 78 percent of the time mothers choose to give life to that baby. [cheers and applause]
You see, a president committed to life and marriage and religious liberty really can make a difference. That's why I was so happy to sign the Susan B. Anthony pro-life pledge without any reservation. And that's why, as president, I will give you my word, I will fight to defund Planned Parenthood—[cheers and applause]—and deny them—[sustained applause]—and deny them their very rich $300 million-a-year stipend that that billion-dollar-a-year corporation is now receiving.
And I will restore the protections for life that President Obama has erased. And as president, I'll put our government out of the abortion industry once and for all—[cheers and applause]—because, you see, we don't have to settle for a moderate. We can do what needs to be done on the cause of life and finally advance this noble cause, because I'm here to tell you, we don't have to settle this year, because this president has not compromise his liberal principles on this issue, and we should not compromise ours either. [applause]
As president, you have my word, I will not compromise on the area of life. When John Adams considered his duties for the generations yet to come, he reflected on what he must do. And I believe there are things that we must do as well. We must decrease the tax and the regulatory burden. I'm a job creator. My husband and I started a business from scratch when we had absolutely nothing, and we are thrilled that we are able to provide people in our state with gainful employment and offer a wonderful service to our customers.
I'm a former federal tax litigation attorney. I understand first-hand, after fighting for years in the United States federal tax court, how decimating high taxes are on individuals and families and farmers. I served on the financial affairs committee here in Congress, and I have seen up close and personal how devastating government intervention has been and how government intervention led to the financial meltdown that occurred between 2006 and 2008. I've been there. I've seen it. I've fought it on Barney Frank's committee.
I know what needs to be done to turn this economy around and to create millions of high-paying jobs again. It can be done if government just gets out of the way—[applause]—because I will understand from day one what this president does not. Government doesn't create jobs. Permanent solutions in the private sector do create jobs. [applause]
And I will understand also from day one what this president does not understand, after being privileged to sit on the House Intelligence Committee, that we must stand up to China. We must stand up to Iran, which seeks a nuclear weapon. We must stand up to the state sponsors of terror in this world, because if we don't, if they are emboldened, if they continue to disrespect the United States of America, if they continue to see the United States of America put daylight—[inaudible]—not happen. And as president of the United States, I will stand against that. [applause]
The United States cannot blink when it comes to radical jihadist terrorists. We must use vision in equipping our military against that threat that continues to plague our nation. We must repeal "Obamacare" and focus on lowering the cost of health care. And we must prevent this president from having the chance to nominate one more liberal ideologue to the Supreme Court. That can never happen again—[applause]—because we need justices who will respect life and respect the Constitution of the United States and respect the limits of the Constitution of the United States.
And together, we must pledge a renewed commitment to the enduring strength of this magnificent constitutional order and the enduring vitality of a free people whose Constitution guarantees unequivocally our right to create and dream in the context of a free society and a free economy.
We are the nation to which the rest of the world repairs. Oh, that we would remain that city on a hill. It can be done if we choose wisely in these next few months. And as John Adams saw and fulfilled his sacred obligation, so too it is incumbent upon us gathered together this evening in this room to fulfill our obligation, not merely to ourselves, but to the next and subsequent generations, as John Adams did 235 years ago.
And if we do this, the hope that Adams had for our generation will follow him. It's one that we may have for generations that will follow us, because I believe if we do what we must, then our children will be free to do what they ought. And if we bring up our children in the way that they should go, so that they will do what they ought, then we can earn for our grandchildren the opportunity and the right to devote their lives to the things that they hope to do—the right to continue to live as a free people in a great republic, the greatest nation that the world has ever known.
And so you have before you this weekend your choice and your decision, and you have a chance to send a message to President Obama that his time in the White House will soon be finished. When you vote in the very all-important straw poll this weekend, that is when you send Barack Obama a message that you not only reject his policies. You see this as your opportunity, when you have a chance to take your voice as part of an all-encompassing movement which I believe has the potential to embrace even 70 percent of the American people to do more than just settle for someone in the other team, wearing the other jersey, because that won't cut it this time in this election, because choosing to settle, you see, is actually quite hard. It means making hard choices. And it requires the very lives of many of our nation's founders. And I don't have to remind you about the fate of many signers of the Declaration of your—of Independence.
And as your president, I want you to know I have no plans to settle. I won't settle for an America that's anything less than the world's economic leader. I won't settle for anything less than standing up for the family, for our faith, for the issue of life. I won't stand up for anything less than the cause of liberty, the very birthright that the founders put everything on the line to give to us. I won't settle.
And tonight I'm calling on all of you as well. Don't settle. As Reagan said, it's a time for choosing. Choose wisely. Choose the future. Choose to go on. Choose economic liberty. Choose military might. Choose religious liberty. We can be great in 2012 if we choose wisely. Choose wisely. It's our birthright.
God bless you. God bless the United States of America. [applause] We will go on. God bless you. God bless you all. Thank you for this magnificent evening. God bless you. [applause]

Address to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, California

October 20, 2011

In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, John Adams wrote, 'You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other.' The challenges we face today have summoned a variety of opinions about the best course of action to solve them. As a former federal tax attorney and a creator of a small business, I can think of no better place than the Commonwealth Club to offer my 'explanation' into the crucible of public debate.
I am honored to be here today at this time honored forum to speak with you about a subject that's little discussed, but eminently important in this 2012 presidential campaign. Over the last several months all of us have been rightly concerned about high unemployment in the midst of an economy that continues to stumble. But little noticed by most Americans was a startling piece of news that is partially responsible for our grave economic times, the fact that America has slipped to fifth in the list of competitive nations.
Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid summed up quite nicely the fantasy economic thinking that dominates Washington, DC today when he said, 'It's very clear that private sector jobs have been doing just fine; it's the public sector jobs where we've lost huge numbers, and that's what this legislation is all about.'
That's despite the fact that since 2007 private sector job losses have been three times greater than governments, and that federal employees took home $126,000 annually which is two and a half times the U.S. median wage. That statement qualifies for Ripley's Believe it or Not.
The United States of America, history's most successful political and economic experiment, has proved that a nation rooted in free market competition has led the world in innovation in areas that have advanced the disciplines of medicine, science, technology and made our quality of life second to none.
But when government gets in the business of picking winners and losers, as in the case of the Solyndra's of this administration, it becomes our cash for government's clunkers, and worse, American competitiveness in the world is badly damaged.
For America to regain its competitive edge in the global economy, we must fundamentally restructure how Washington spends money, radically reform the tax code, educate more and better trained Americans, provide for more efficient movement of goods, encourage fair trade relationships, and reduce unilateral regulatory barriers for entry into the marketplace.
The passing of Steve Jobs saddened us all. He was more than the co-founder of Apple. He was an icon who represented what is great about America, and he never settled constantly asking employees if they had produced their best product.
We have always been about being on the cutting edge leading the world in new ideas and innovations. Steve Jobs represented that ideal at its best. Who could have imagined just a few years ago that you could have all of your music, a camera, video camera, your photos, your phone, an encyclopedia all connected to the world at your fingertips? Steve Jobs could. He and his team changed our world for the better.
The Steve Jobs spirit still exists in the imaginations of young entrepreneurs today. A recent Wall Street Journal article indicates that 77 percent of all students surveyed by Gallup about their aspirations responded that they wanted to be their own boss. Forty-five percent of America's youth want to start their own business and 42 percent said, 'I will invent something that changes the world.'
The next generation of 'Steve Jobs' is out there waiting to step up and drive the engine of American innovation and competition. Entrepreneurship is the fastest-growing course of study on campuses nationwide. So the desire to succeed remains. The challenge is that many of these students lack basic information and experience to enter the work force, much less start companies.
Now take, by comparison, a government enterprise, the Post Office, which yearns to remain committed to paying higher labor costs that bear no comparison to wages paid in the private sector. The Wall Street Journal reported, the U.S. Post Office so desperate for self-preservation is considering selling hunting licenses, country music CD's, and coffee to try and make ends meet.
They have failed to innovate and keep up with the free market systems of delivering products to consumers and now are billions in the red and looking to the taxpayer for money. They have failed the tests of innovation. If these gimmicks fail to get them to break even, perhaps they'll resort to bake sales.
The Post Office proves why government shouldn't displace propriety functions—that is what Steve Jobs practiced as one of his secrets to success —'simplicity and saying no to 1000 things.' Instead, the oxymoron of government run businesses is that they say yes to everything and will spend anything because they're not driven by the need for profit.
Researchers, entrepreneurs and investors across America have been paralyzed by this president's anti-business policies that have created severe uncertainty. As president, I will signal by way of leadership to innovators, that the time has come to once again unleash the genius of Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' working to create the wealth of the nation.
What drives investment and the execution of innovative ideas is an environment that fosters it. A perfect example is Israel, which enjoys 2.5 times the venture investments than the United States, as a result of their culture embracing innovation.
My American Jobs, Right Now solutions are aimed at fostering that culture, which will turn our economy around and create high paying jobs that come with increased competitiveness and innovation.
Our nation's ability to compete in the global economy begins with education. We must demand strong schools so that young Americans enter the workforce with the math, science and problem-solving skills they need to succeed in the knowledge economy. Education has always been the gateway to a better life in this country, and our primary and secondary schools were long considered the world's best. But on an international math test in 2003, U.S. high school students ranked 24th out of 29 industrialized nations surveyed.
Our schools can do better. I got into politics because of education. As a mom I saw the politically correct, dumbing down of their curriculum and decided I needed to work to improve the education system for our kids. That's why I would close the Department of Education and return the control of education resources and the decisions about how those resources are allocated to the local level where they are best made. Not only does the Department of Education not know what's best for local schools, they have taken billions of dollars from the states to pay for their expensive bureaucracy. That sort of government behavior must end.
Our competitiveness depends on well-educated people. American educated scientists and engineers have been the driving force behind our tech revolution but we're not graduating enough of them. To keep our competitive edge and remain the world's top tech innovator, we need to raise the math and science skills of our students.
College tuitions are out of control while paradoxically the availability of information has never been greater. The nation's young entrepreneurs are graduating with enormous debts that often steer them away from pursuing starting a new business, and instead toward stable jobs that increase their ability to pay down their loans.
Every child deserves a quality education so they can succeed in life while keeping America strong economically and militarily.
We must never ignore the power of human capital in our quest to be the leading force for innovation and competition. And we must never forget that education begins at home and that the family is the most important component of any child's education—we must protect the integrity of the family in the life of a child.
Part of producing an effective workforce means that we have to reform employment laws. Employees deserve the right to work, and the federal government's National Labor Relations Board shouldn't interfere with that right like they are doing with Boeing in South Carolina.
Reforming employment law also means making it easier to reward good employees and to find bad ones a new line of work. This also means reforming our unemployment insurance system that was created 50 years ago to help workers through temporary layoffs. Under the model, after business picked up, they could go back to the same job, in the same factory, at the same company, selling to the same customers. That is not the world in which employees now live. Now when workers are laid off, the job is gone.
Today unemployment insurance, even by the admission of the administration's newest economic council member, Alan Krueger, is a disincentive to work and increases the length of joblessness.
Another pillar for competitiveness is a healthy investment climate so our technology industry will continue to thrive. Hi-tech capital investments will flow to the country where Internet delivery is fast and efficient, where financial markets are strong, and where taxes are kept low.
To promote innovation, we should make the research and development tax credit permanent to maximize the private sector innovation it encourages in our economy. That's why I have serious concerns about government getting involved in regulation of the Internet, and about ambiguities in this legislation, which could lead to an explosion of destructive, innovation-stalling lawsuits.
In the 1980′s Ronald Reagan enacted tax reform that created a period of unparalleled prosperity. I intend to increase our competitiveness by following his blueprint for tax reform, which had as its core principle to stop taxing investment and productivity.
If America is to once again regain its footing as the world's competitive leader, we must abolish the U.S. tax code and replace it with a fairer, flatter, more simple one that has at its core a corporate rate that is one of the lowest in the world.
In addition to extending the capital gains exemption and modifying the code to promote investment, the corporate tax rate must be lowered substantially. I will.
As part of this revision, I would address the problem of foreign earnings trapped abroad and enable these companies to bring those earnings home and invest in America, a practice known as repatriation of American dollars.
Repatriation and a low corporate tax rate would incentivize American businesses to return to America's shores and spur manufacturing in America. And most importantly repatriation is a stimulus to the U.S. economy not funded on the backs of taxpayers.
Uniquely American values include the right and opportunity to work, and the right to keep the fruits of your labor—that it is your money and not the government's to spend or waste. Without private property rights there can be no liberty, and without liberty there can be no America.
Fourteen million of out of work Americans, most of whom were laid off through no fault of their own, have lost their economic liberty. And America's job creators and small business owners like myself, have lost our economic liberty under the weight of $1.8 trillion annually in compliance costs with government regulations. "Together we sent $2.2 trillion in taxes to the federal government this year. By comparison, job creators spend nearly as much annually to comply with bureaucratic mandates.
'Entrepreneurs here are forced to test promising medical devices in costly animal studies for years before they can advance their products into clinical trials,' Scott Gottlieb writes in The Wall Street Journal. 'This is no way to run a regulatory process if the FDA is serious about promoting medical innovation and advancing the public health.'
FDA overregulation is killing the medical device and drug innovation sectors in the United States, and this is but one example of how government regulation is stifling American innovation and competition.
I will repeal massive government overregulation, beginning with the Environmental Protection Agency that is killing thousands of United States jobs. That is the first step in legalizing American Energy Production and creating 1.4 million jobs. We already have an EPA in each state today.
This past week I returned to Washington to vote for one of the components of my American Jobs, Right Now economic recovery plan, finalizing free trade agreements that the president could have passed years ago, but chose not to.
The benefits of American leadership to open global markets in the past half-century have been enormous — a total of $1 trillion higher income every year or nearly $3,500 for every man, women and child in America. The advocates of bigger government could try to spend twice that much and not accomplish one-half the good.
I have always believed in the power of the American people, and the importance of keeping marginal tax rates low. I've observed first hand the tax reform the economic geniuses in Washington can dream up doesn't begin to match the prosperity generated by pursuing private opportunities. The failure to seek new markets is a tax on the American dream.
We can look around and see the fruits of bringing down barriers to trade — it has helped keep inflation under control, interest rates low, and made many goods more affordable to lower- and middle-income consumers.
My American Jobs, Right Now solutions call for repatriating over 1.2 trillion American dollars from overseas; massively cutting federal spending by eliminating government agencies and the size of government; repealing Obamacare in its totality—the government takeover of our healthcare system; cutting taxes on investment and productivity, including corporate taxes; repealing the Job and Housing Destruction Act, better known as Dodd-Frank in its totality; repealing $1.8 trillion in annual job killing regulations; increasing exports by finalizing free trade agreements; spurring new investment in America; inspiring innovation; and legalizing American energy production, including decreased regulations on developing new energy supplies from our abundant domestic energy resources; and finally enforce America's immigration laws—ending taxpayer benefits and magnets to illegal aliens and their children.
When the government borrows 43 cents of every dollar it spends you know we're choosing an economic train wreck. Which is why Admiral Mullen said, our national debt has profound national security implications.
John Adams recognized that at critical times in history, a generation is required to set aside its preferred pursuits and embrace the sacrifices needed to secure the blessings of liberty for the next generation.
We saw it happen with Adams' own generation, the founders who put everything on the line and everything they owned to form a new kind of government, one founded on the consent of the people, and one dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. This is our nation's creed.
Americans have always looked forward to new opportunities, and embraced new challenges, and we can do so again to leave a better country for our posterity.
We can restore United States' competitiveness, but to do so we must constrain the reach of government and protect the rights our founders gave their last full measure of devotion to ensure. May each one of us as true servants of the people and most assuredly of our blessed constitution go, and do likewise.
Bill Gates said, 'During the past 30 years, U.S. innovation has been the catalyst for the digital information revolution. If the United States is to remain a global economic leader, we must foster an environment that enables a new generation to dream up innovations. Talent in this country is not the problem — the issue is political will.'
Answering great challenges is nothing new to America. It's what we do. We created the technology that landed man safely on the moon not because it was easy but because it was hard. We've sent space probes to explore the distant reaches of the universe. We harnessed nuclear energy, mapped the human genome, created the Internet and pioneered integrated circuits that possess the computing power of Apollo spacecraft on a single silicon chip you can barely see.
We can once again be the leader in global competitiveness. America's time has not passed, only the baton of responsibility has passed to the next generation of 'Steve Jobs' and the next generation of leaders needed to create the competitive economic culture they need to flourish. I am ready to meet those challenges and do the hard work necessary to restore America to the economic leader it can be for America's children—your children, my children.
God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

Address to the Family Research Council in Washington, D.C.

November 7, 2011

I'd like to thank Tony Perkins, Tom McClosky and the Family Research Council for hosting this event today. I can't think of a better place than the Family Research Council to discuss the core of my conviction that will guide how I govern if I were to become President of the United States. The Family Research Council has been a beacon of light in protecting the family unit, and I thank them for their leadership.
The most important promise that any president makes to the American people is this one: 'I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. So help me God.'
Too many actions by too many presidents demonstrate that this oath has meant little in recent years. Today, President Obama appears intent on stretching, bending, and ignoring the Constitution by abusing executive power and picking and choosing which laws he will enforce.
My explanation of constitutional government is for something far more important than a menu of policy details. I want you to know the principles that will govern my decision making as president. When events arise and facts change and Congress intervenes, policies have to adapt. Principles however, should be unchanging. They should be the core of one's conviction.
The purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property. President Obama believes the purpose of government is to provide for our needs and some of our wants. And he is willing to engage in massive redistribution of wealth and the politics of envy to achieve this purpose.
I will understand from day one what the current president does not: When the American people entrust someone with the awesome power of the presidency, they have given that person the privilege of serving under our Constitution, not a license to put themselves above it.
The president's economic policies, most notably Obamacare, represent the most ambitious social-economic engineering project in the history of this country. And they threaten to rewrite the fundamental assumptions of the role of government in American's lives since the New Deal and the Great Society. The 10th Commandment teaches those shall not covet thy neighbors' goods. It's time to act on this self-evident truth.
America needs to open its eyes. Look at Europe. Focus your attention on Greece. Socialism is unsustainable. There simply isn't enough money to pay for all the wants of all the people.
Yet, while Greece is crashing President Obama has called for more government welfare—more government funded student loans—more government mortgages—more government spending to create more government jobs.
President Obama doesn't merely have the wrong policies—he has the wrong principles.
But sadly far too many Republicans aspire to be frugal socialists. The reason President Obama and some Republicans can get behind socialized medicine is because they share the same core political philosophy about the purpose of government.
We cannot preserve liberty for ourselves and our posterity if the choice in next November is between a frugal socialist and an out-of-control socialist.
The government given to us was a constitutional republic where the elected legislators make all of the laws. In fact, the most important question for any organization is: Who makes the rules?
This is true of the NFL, a college student government, and it is certainly true of the United States. When President Obama issues executive orders about student loans, mortgages, green energy plans, or anything else that directly controls private people or private property—he is making laws.
The president or executive agencies should not make law.
One of the most serious problems with Obamacare is the number of times that the legislation says…the Secretary shall make rules…The rules on abortion funding, and countless other areas, are not found in the Obamacare bill itself—but in the reams of rules that have begun to emerge from the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
That is why I have been advocating for the repeal of Obamacare from almost the minute it was passed. Some have naively said they will issue waivers or executive orders to stop Obamacare, but only the full-scale repeal can stop the cancer of Obamacare from metastasizing across all of healthcare and our economy. We cannot afford to have a candidate who doesn't understand the complexity of Obamacare or the urgency of its repeal.
Congress needs to take back the responsibility to pass all the laws for our country. If the laws are bad, the voters need to be able to fire the people who wrote them. Likewise, the judiciary does not make the law.
President Obama believes judges can change the meaning of the Constitution by reinterpreting its words and by discovering new unwritten rights that the founders never contemplated including the use of UN treaties and other international law to interpret our Constitution.
A Supreme Court truly dedicated to original intent, would look to the original meaning of the Constitution, to the records of the Constitutional Convention, the Federalist Papers, and other contemporaneous legal sources.
The UN has nothing to say to us about the meaning of the United States Constitution. I guarantee that as President every single judicial nominee will have demonstrated to my satisfaction that they are unwaveringly committed to the rule of law—as that law was originally written.
President Obama has committed to the ratification of a number of UN treaties including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child when that would bind us to legal obligations internationally and domestically.
According to Article VI of the Constitution, once ratified, a treaty becomes a part of the supreme law of the land. Moreover, any state law that conflicts with a treaty is void.
Virtually all American law regarding parents and children is state law. And this UN treaty contains scores of rules that contradict existing American law regarding medical care, education, religion, and virtually every area of parental decision making. This treaty threatens the most basic unit of government that the Family Research Council and many of the organizations represented here today attempt to defend, the family.
As president, I will withdraw the signature of the United States from this treaty and every other unratified UN treaty of this type.
The UN is not the only threat to the American family. Some American officials have also gone too far in invading the legitimate decisions of American parents like being told by their doctors and insurance companies, that federal HIPAA regulations prevent them from obtaining their children's medical records and even medical test results. This is ridiculous!
I was an early co-sponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment and I will assure passage of this as president.
In Troxel v. Granville—Justice Scalia recently wrote that until parental rights are written into the actual text of the Constitution, there is no basis for a judge to protect parental rights. While he is just one justice, the lower federal courts are in disarray with far too many federal judges rejecting the idea that parental rights are fundamental.
Judges may be confused about the importance of parents in the life of a child. I don't share their confusion. Make no mistake, while not always possible, children are best served when they are raised in a home with a mom and a dad—I will fight to protect the rights of parents, the family and the institution of marriage—those are at the core of my conviction.
The misinterpretation of the Commerce Clause and the General Welfare Clause in the constitution are chiefly responsible for the runaway debt and regulatory chaos that threaten to crush our economy and curtail our liberty.
For example, Congress used the Commerce Clause to close all of the incandescent light bulb factories in the United States and replace them with so-called environmentally friendly bulbs. In response, I introduced the Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act.
But this wasn't just about the right to choose what light bulb you wished—it was about our fundamental rights as citizens to not have the government tell us how we are to live out our daily lives. At my core is the belief that it is the American people and not the government who know what is best for their lives and that government exists to protect that right to liberty and not to diminish it.
I believe the Constitution assigns one and only one level of government to deal with each area of policy. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over foreign policy, military affairs, the protection of our borders, the minting of our money, and a few other topics.
States have exclusive jurisdiction over health, education, welfare, family law, and the vast majority of criminal law. The Tenth Amendment tells us that if the subject is not assigned to Congress, it remains by default with the states.
The people do not get double or triple the services when multiple layers of government address the same issue—we get conflict, confusion, and unnecessary expense.
As president, I guarantee you two things. First, I will veto every new law from Congress that seeks to add yet another layer of unconstitutional regulation under the guise of the Commerce Clause. Second, I will begin the process of reversing the damage from decades of Great Society-type programs.
I will draw a line in the sand and do only what the Constitution allows. One of the keys to Steve Jobs' success was that he said no to 1,000 things. I guess he learned that wise principle from the founders.
The government should do what it does best, protect the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the private sector in what should be freest society on the face of earth should do what it does best—nurture the engine of economic growth that has made us the most prosperous nation on the face of the earth.
We are nearly $15 trillion in debt because of an improper view of the General Welfare Clause. The current view is that Congress can spend unlimited money on any fool thing it wants. Congress believes that the Constitution imposes no limit on its spending.
I beg to differ. And I would point out that the Founding Fathers also beg to differ.
In Butler v. United States the Supreme Court addressed the question: What limits on federal spending are imposed by the Constitution?
The Court pointed out that there was a dispute between Alexander Hamilton and James Madison on this issue. Madison thought the spending power was strictly limited to enumerated powers, while Hamilton believed that there was additional power to spend in the General Welfare Clause itself.
But Hamilton's view was not the same as the theory in vogue in Washington today. Hamilton believed: Congress can spend money on programs that are truly in the national interest, but only for purposes that are beyond the jurisdiction of the states.
Here is a practical example from history. Thomas Jefferson worried that his Louisiana Purchase was unconstitutional because there was no enumerated power to make land purchases to expand the nation. But Hamilton believed the Louisiana Purchase was justified by the General Welfare Clause because it was beyond the power of the states to make such purchases.
Like the Louisiana Purchase, today's space program also passes this constitution's two-part test for federal spending: 1) It is for the general welfare and 2) It is beyond the jurisdiction of the states.
By contrast, social welfare programs are within the jurisdiction of the states. Both Hamilton and Madison would agree that the federal government couldn't spend money on welfare programs.
Education also belongs to the states. The federal government has no constitutional jurisdiction to spend money on education programs. I'll repeal federal education law, close the Department of Education and let the states keep the money they've been sending to the federal government to fuel the leviathan bureaucracy of the department of education where its employees make nearly double what the average teacher in the classroom makes.
Our founding fathers were really very efficient political planners. They gave each area of government responsibility to one and only one level of government.
Unless we want to go the way of Greece, we have to adhere to the organizational structure of the Constitution and stop the federal government from spending for purposes that are only within the jurisdiction of the states.
As president I will veto all new spending for new programs that properly belong to the states and I will begin the systematic process of dismantling the current duplication.
I want to say one very important thing about Article IV of the Constitution. This article says that Congress has the duty to guarantee a republican form of government.
The principle of self-government that there should be no taxation without representation was the rallying cry—and that principle lies at the heart of what it means to have a republican form of government.
We are violating the constitutional commitment to self-government for our posterity by imposing a crushing burden of federal debt on our children, grandchildren, and the generations beyond. George Washington warned against the 'progressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all governments.'
For every $143 of federal spending we are only paying for $100 with current taxes. We are sending the bill for the other $43, with compounding interest, to the generations yet to come.
Future citizens will be taxed tomorrow for money that's already been spent to finance a welfare state lurching towards decline. Yet, future generations had no vote on whether to spend this money.
That is an immoral act and, it is an unconstitutional taxation without representation. It is unconscionable that we continue to borrow from future prosperity to live more comfortable today.
Much of that spending and taxing occurs because government does what both the constitution and decent morality prohibit, that is cronyism capitalism, or forcefully taking your money for the purpose of paying off a politician's political friends. The problem is one set of standards for individual Americans and another set of standards for those who make political donations to candidates. This practice whether at the state level or the federal level is letting the interest of the few outweigh the majority of Americans who don't have access to the system. I will end this system of political pay for play that is out of control in Washington.
The solution is beyond obvious. What we all know what Greece must do, we must do ourselves, and immediately.
I will honor the Constitution by never sending Congress an unbalanced budget for their consideration—except in times of declared war. And if Congress passes an unbalanced budget, they better have two-thirds of both houses behind their extravagance, because I promise you that I will veto such spending every time.
In fiscal year 2010, the United States gave away $1.4 billion to countries like China, Mexico, Egypt, and other nations each of whom own at least $10 billion in U.S. treasury bonds. China owns over $1.2 trillion in these bonds. This is a significant portion of our national debt.
Giving money away for free to the nations that own our debt instruments is like giving your banker a large gift while he still holds your unpaid mortgage.
I will stop such foreign aid at once. If these nations are rich enough to loan us money, they don't need our aid and we can't afford it. The financial gifts we are making to China and these others will come to a screeching halt of the day I am sworn into office.
My concern for children is not limited to protecting them from financial bondage. First and foremost, I believe that every child has the right to life because every child is made in the image and likeness of a Holy God.
I am not confused by what it means to be 100 percent pro-life. I am both personally and publicly pro-life. I believe it is the role of government to protect life from conception to natural death. I'll never be confused about that issue and you won't find you tube clips with me advocating otherwise. For starters, Planned Parenthood will be zeroed out if I am president.
I will also work to protect the American family from activist judges who are trying to dismantle marriage as a legal institution solely between one man and one woman.
Some Republican candidates seem confused about this issue. I am not—it is the core of my conviction.
I want a Federal Marriage Amendment so the courts cannot impose their will on us. When one state's judiciary legalizes same sex marriage, the legal pressure on every state to recognize such marriages is profound. One federal judge has already ruled that the voters in California violated the federal Constitution by voting to limit marriage to one man and one woman. And President Obama has ordered his justice department not to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act.
That flawed analysis will be the path of future activist courts and an example for future president's to overrun the will of the people and the legislative branch for their own will. Only a federal marriage amendment can prevent the courts of one state from imposing same-sex marriage on us all. One year from yesterday, the American public will make a decision about the future direction of our country. We will decide what kind of nation we want to be.
I believe this election is the last exit ramp to regain our constitutional heritage. After that Obamacare will be impossible to repeal. Do we want to be a free nation—a nation that aspires to protect life, liberty, and property? Or, do we want to be a socialist nation—committed to centralized government providing all needs for all people?
This election season has been full of surprises. I can assure you there are no surprises with me. I am far from a perfect person, but I know who I am and I will never deviate from the principles that I have fought for all of my life. I understand the challenges this nation faces, both domestic and foreign and I understand who are our enemies and our allies, and I'm prepared to face them.
If we want to have a real choice next November—the bold colors of difference that Reagan described—then it is crucial that the Republican Party choose a candidate in January, February, and March who is committed as I am to liberty and who has demonstrated a life long commitment to fighting to protect constitutional government.
I am the candidate you can trust in office because as president I am and will be truly committed to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. That commitment is the core of my conviction.
I will be such a president.

Address to the Zionist Organization of America in New York City

November 20, 2011

I'm honored to be here this evening in the company of so many friends. Thank you, Mort, for that kind introduction. Like this organization, I have been a long-time advocate for the land of Israel and the Jewish people. My love for Israel and its people deepened while I worked on a kibbutz just after graduating from high school.
It seems as if lately, our president has forgotten the importance of Israel to America and thinks of our relationship only in terms of what we do for Israel. The president is more concerned about Israel building homes on its own land than the threats that Israel and America face in the region.
The president was right to promise to veto the Palestinians' bid for statehood in the UN Security Council. But in large part it is the president's weakness in the Middle East that has emboldened the Palestinians to attempt to achieve statehood through the UN rather than at the legitimate negotiation table with Israel. Our policy has confused engagement with appeasement and has inspired Israel's enemies.
The Palestinians must recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce violence against Israel in order to become a serious partner in peace with Israel.
I stand with Israel. And aid to Israel now more than ever, is a necessity—they are our most trusted ally and the only real democracy in the Middle East. "While the president demands Israel give back land necessary to protect their existence, he has taken his eye off of the most serious threat to Middle East security, a nuclear Iran.
Some 80 years ago the world saw evil rising. A mad man spoke, but the world did not listen and the world sank into an enormous conflict and millions of Jews lost their lives.
Today a mad man again speaks and once again it seems as if the world isn't really listening though Iran's president has made his intentions for Israel clear. He intends to wipe Israel from the face of the earth once he obtains nuclear weapons, and he will seek to use them against the United States shortly after achieving his first goal.
Consider the Iranian constitution which states that Iran's Army and Revolutionary Guard 'will be responsible…for fulfilling the ideological mission of jihad in God's way; that is, extending the sovereignty of God's law throughout the world.'
And Iran has made good on that promise over the last 30 years from the bombing of the United States Marine base in Beirut to being the leading supplier of arms to kill Americans in Iraq. Iran is at the heart of much of Israel's problems.
That is why I co-sponsored Louie Gohmert's resolution expressing support for the State of Israel's right to defend Israeli sovereignty, to protect the lives and safety of the Israeli people, and to use all means necessary to confront and eliminate nuclear threats posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the use of military force if no other peaceful solution can be found.
Two principles must guide U.S. policy toward Iran. First, we must never allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. And second, we must realize that this is as much a threat to U.S. national security as it is to Israel's and should not outsource U.S. national security to the United Nations. This is the moment for clarity in standing with Israel and against Iran.
We can't afford to wait until the election to change course, the president must make it the policy of the United States now to support the dissidents of the current regime in Iran to bring down the terrorist leaders and replace it with a democratic government at peace with the U.S., Israel and the free world.
The president had an opportunity to do this shortly after taking office and failed to do so. The U.S. should meet publicly with Iranian dissidents, and strongly assist pro-freedom elements of the Iranian opposition movement. "The U.S. must be clear that it is the policy of the United States to stop Iran from building and deploying nuclear weapons. In leading from behind the president has been ambiguous with Iran and has given them the luxury of time to advance their nuclear weapons program without real punishment as we learned from the IAEA report last week.
The U.S. should develop and deploy comprehensive ballistic missile systems on land, at sea, in the air, and in space to protect the American people and our allies from the threat of ballistic missiles. Iran, with the help of the Chinese has obtained missile delivery systems for nuclear weapons that pose a threat to Israel, to the region and potentially the United States.
While the United States does not buy oil from Iran, Iran is a major player in the oil market and affects its price, which directly affects the United States. We need to legalize American energy production to free us from Iran's influence through oil.
The U.S. must immediately end appeasement and weakness towards Iran and pursue decisive, common sense strategies ignored or rejected by the current administration.
We need Secretaries of State and Defense who fully support a pro-freedom and security policy towards Iran, and we need them to replace those in the bureaucracy — especially at State — who will not fully support this policy.
We need crushing economic sanctions on Iran, including on the central bank and the oil and gas industries. We must hurt the Iranian economy more severely by doing damage to their oil revenues and their central bank.
The president stands with Occupy Wall Street, but he doesn't stand with Israel. When Israel looks at President Obama, they don't see a friend.
The State Department should regularly expose the atrocious activities of the Iranian regime that are arresting, imprisoning, torturing and murdering innocent Iranian citizens.
We must accelerate covert operations and cyber operations in Iran and order the CIA Director to take all means necessary to stop Iran from getting the Bomb before it is too late. The Pentagon should prepare a war plan, as a last resort, should all else fail in preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
But the president's lack of leadership and the failure of the Super Committee this week will lead to, in Defense Secretary Panetta's words, 'devastating cuts that will seriously damage readiness' making a military response more difficult. President Obama has seriously damaged the security of Israel by decreasing our status as a military superpower.
Part of that plan should be to direct the Navy to make preparations for a possible blockade of Iran's ports from all oil and gas imports and exports to cut off critical petroleum revenues from going to the regime in Tehran.
We should continue comprehensive missile defense development while moving additional Aegis and Patriot missile defense systems into the Middle East to protect U.S. citizens and assets, Israel and our allies.
We must sell Israel the additional fighter jets, bunker buster bombs, refueling tankers and other materials they need to defend themselves. And the U.S. should announce that the U.S. Embassy will be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
I do not take lightly the prospect of committing U.S. troops in an effort to stop Iran. Only a fool wishes for war. But we must be prepared to do whatever is necessary to stop the Iranians from obtaining a nuclear weapon and massively destabilizing the region by attacking our ally Israel, and supplying those weapons to even more radical regimes or individuals that would use them to do harm to America and its way of life.
Hitler once famously said in justification of his order to murder millions of Jews, 'Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?' Ahmadinejad is counting on the same collective memory today as he marches toward a second Holocaust.
We must send him the message that we will never forget!
God bless you and God bless Israel and God bless the United States of America.

Remarks in West Des Moines Following the Iowa Caucus

January 3, 2012

Thank you Brad. I appreciate that. I was introduced in all 99 counties with that same phrase, "Pound for pound, no one takes it to them more." I can't thank him enough, and the entire Iowa team, you guys, thank you for everything y'all have done. I just have some prepared remarks. I'm so grateful that you're here, and then we'll have a party afterwards, so stick around. Thank you so much, everyone. And thank you, too, to Iowa, my home state.
I've called Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry to congratulate each one of them on their respective places this evening in the lineup. The people of Iowa have spoken, and they have written the very first chapter in this long journey to take our country back from Barack Obama. And make no mistake, we will.
Once again, this wonderful republic that we are privileged to live in has worked. The process worked. It's the people of Iowa who chose tonight. It wasn't the pundits, it wasn't the media, and while this has been a very tough campaign, we should never forget that its crucible will make the eventual nominee tried for even the tougher battle that is yet to come against Barack Obama.
I am so proud of the people who have run our campaign here in Iowa and I will be forever grateful to this wonderful state and to the wonderful people of Iowa for launching us on our path to victory in the Iowa straw poll. And this state has given voice to people all over our country, that Barack Obama's liberal policies are finished. And that in 2012, there will be another occupant in the White House. Who knows, maybe even another Michelle in the White House. [applause]
And that once again, it's the people's voice that will be heard there. And make no mistake, as I have said often and early, on this campaign, Barack Obama will be a one-term president. Did you hear that, America? You heard it here from Iowa.
I'm a very real person. I am not a politician, nor do I ever hope or aspire to be a politician. I saw what the government was doing to all of us, to our children, and doing to our liberties. And so I decided to stand up. I decided that I was going to fight not only for our five children and our 23 foster children, but also for your children too, because they deserve it. We deserve to give them a better and a more hopeful future. It's really true, and I'm sorry to say we have strayed from the vision of our founders' view of government and the 2012 election might very well be our last opportunity to reclaim our liberty from a government that somehow seems bent on taking more and more of it away from us every day.
But since day one of Barack Obama's presidency, I have led the fight in Washington against his liberal socialist policies. And when the president wanted a $1 trillion stimulus package, I said no. And when the president pushed to take over your health care and replace it with socialized medicine, I led 40,000 people to Washington, D.C., to let the president know that the American people were against it. We don't want socialized medicine. We're not going to keep socialized medicine. And Barack Obama's socialized medicine will be repealed. [applause]
When the president said last summer he wanted to raise the debt limit to an unbelievable $16 trillion, I said no. Over the last three years, the American people have tragically been deprived in their president a leader, as he routinely withers when he's confronted with paramount challenges of our generation.
President Obama is guarded and guided by his hardened ideology, and he's withheld any prospect for economic recovery, as he routinely places his own political fortunes and his own re-election plans above the interests of the American people.
Look no further than his denial of building the Keystone 2 pipeline. That was all about his re-election, nothing to do with energy independence for the American people. His liberal reign will end and the American people in our economy will finally be free, because you see, what we need is a candidate in the likeness and image of a Ronald Reagan, who has bold differences necessary to take on a Barack Obama. What we need is a fearless conservative, one with no compromises on their record, on spending, on health care, on crony capitalism, on defending America, on standing with our ally, Israel, on securing our border from illegal immigrants, or on defending innocent, unborn life or protecting marriage between one man and one woman.
If anyone's confused, so we can defeat Barack Obama and his failed socialist policies. I believe that I am that true conservative who can and who will defeat Barack Obama in 2012.
And over the next few days, just be prepared, the pundits and the press will again try to pick the nominee based on tonight's results, but there are many more chapters to be written on the path to our party's nomination. And I'd prefer to let the people of the country decide who will represent us.
And, of course, I'm very deeply grateful to our Iowa team, to the many dedicated volunteers who have given so much of their time to this effort. It's absolutely amazing to see our offices filled day after day with young people, as they selflessly volunteered, because they need to have a better future, full of more opportunities than our generation had.
And I also think all of the volunteers who have been there almost on a daily basis making phone calls from before the straw poll. You know who you are. I know who you are. And I thank you for your dedication. I hope you know how much your dedication not only meant to me but to our country.
And of course, it shouldn't be even needed to be said, but it must be said. I must thank my wonderful husband of 33 years, Marcus Bachmann. [applause]
He is the best campaigner in our family. And yesterday when we were out on Main Street in Des Moines, he was buying doggy sunglasses for our dog, boomer, while we were out visiting all the many businesses. And all our children who are here this evening, our son Lucas, our son Harrison, our daughter Elisa, our daughter Caroline, our daughter Sophia, we love them all. Our 23 foster children, we love them. My brothers are here tonight. Scott, I have Paul, I have Gary, we sister-in-law, Lori, and my others who couldn't be here as well. But I'm so grateful for them. And my wonderful mother who if you all wonder where I got my height from, I have no excuse, my mother Jeanne and my stepdad Ray and all of my family who's here.
Their love, their encouragement, their faith means more to me than I can begin to say. But more than anything, I thank the God who loves us, the God who gave us life, who gave us our being, who created and drew this nation into existence. It is to the God of our fathers that we give praise this evening. So I thank you all for being here tonight. God bless you. God bless the United States.

Remarks Announcing the End of Presidential Campaign Activities

January 4, 2012

Entrusted to every American is the responsibility to watch over our republic. From the pilgrims, to William Penn, to our founding fathers, we are encompassed about with a great cloud of witnesses that bear witness to the sacrifices made to establish our country and the precious principles of freedom that make it the greatest force for good on the planet. Each generation serves as the next stepping stone down the path of liberty.
Everyday I am reminded of the connection we have to the principles of freedom and justice by a painting, Howard Chandler Christy's scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States, which hangs in the East Grand Stairway of the United States Capitol.
But never was the painting's reminder more poignant than on the evening of March 21, 2010, the day Obamacare was passed. Staring out from the painting is the face of Ben Franklin as a consistent reminder of the fragile Republic he and the founders gave to us. That day served as the inspiration for my run for the presidency of the United States, because I believed firmly that what we had done in passing Obamacare endangered our Republic. I believed that it was my obligation to ensure that President Obama's program of socialized medicine was stopped before it became fully implemented.
And so my message has been the necessity for the complete repeal of Obamacare in this once in a lifetime campaign cycle. Obamacare represents the largest expansion of entitlement spending and playground of left wing social engineering in our country's history and must be stopped. Its repeal is more than just cliche for me, it is essential to my core of conviction because Obamacare violates the fundamental rights of freedom at the core of our republic, including for the first time in the history of the country, taxpayer funded abortion.
Deeply troubled by the state of our country, I ran for the Presidency foremost as an American citizen who believes in the foundation and greatness of our American principles. Our principles derive their meaning from the founders beliefs, rooted in the truths of the Bible.
And, while a Congresswoman by title, a politician I will never be. Motivated not by vainglory or the promise of political power, I have served one singular purpose in Washington DC — to lead an effort begun by the people to restore America. I ran as the next stepping stone of passing on and protecting the torch of freedom. That duty required taking on the charge of repealing Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, which mandated ensuring the election of thirteen more republican senators to guarantee their demise.
The implementation of Obamacare will represent a turning point for our country and our economy. And I worried what a future painting in Christy's vain might depict should Obamacare be placed into effect. Would future generations ask of us, what did we do and what did we give up to ensure the survival of our republic? I ran because I realized that 2012 is our last chance to get rid of Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, and I knew how to get rid of them. And I ran not only for me, but also to elect 13 more United States senators who could help me repeal it.
I ran because I have believed that since day one Barack Obama's policies, based in socialism, are destructive to the very foundations of our republic. I ran because I wanted my children and all of the children of this country to live free and have better opportunities than their parents had. I ran to secure the promise of their future. And so I decided to stand up for our country and fight.
And I'll keep fighting the president's agenda of socialism. And I'll keep fighting for you. Fighting for more liberty and less government. Fighting to stop the overspending in Washington. Fighting to keep our country free, safe and sovereign. Fighting against crony capitalism in Washington. Fighting to end excessive government regulation and a tax code that is unfair and kills American competitiveness. Fighting to legalize American energy production. Fighting for American families. Fighting to protect life from conception until natural death. Fighting to protect traditional marriage. Fighting to secure our borders. And fighting for religious liberty. I will fight for this country and for the American people everyday in the way that God allows me.
And so I came back here to this wonderful state where I was born and raised and that I've come to trust and love. And I had just one message: to tell you that I mean what I say and say what I mean. I've told you the truth that our country is in trouble and that this might be the last election to turn the country around before we go down the road to socialism to a burden of debt too heavy for our children to bear. I didn't just tell you what the polls said you wanted to hear. I didn't tell you what I knew to be false. I didn't try to spin you. I listened to the people of Iowa and all across America, and they agree that President Obama and his liberal policies must be stopped and that we must repeal Obamacare.
I sought nomination of the party of Lincoln and of Reagan that believes in the strength and goodness of the American people and that America is the greatest force for good on the planet. We don't believe that government has the answers, but that it should respect the rights and opportunities of the people to whom we are accountable. We believe that government should do its job as enumerated by the constitution and not your job, and that it should do it without spending more than it takes in.
Last night the people of Iowa spoke with a clear voice, and so I have decided to stand aside. I believe that if we are going to repeal Obamacare, turn our economy around and take back our country we must be united. I believe we must rally behind the person our country and our party selects to be that standard bearer. But make no mistake I will continue to be a strong voice. I will continue to stand and fight for this country and for the American people and for our freedom because Mr. Franklin and all of the founders, all of the men and women who given their last full measure of devotion are watching us. And we owe it to them, to our posterity, and to our God to keep our republic free.
I will be forever grateful to this state and its people for launching us on this path with our victory in the Iowa Straw Poll. While I will not be continuing in this race, my faith in the Lord God Almighty, this country, in our republic, has been strengthened. As I have traveled around this state and the country I have seen the very best in America, our people. And I will always believe in the greatness of them and the greatness of our God.
And, of course, I am deeply grateful to our entire campaign team, here in Iowa, in South Carolina and everywhere. I have no regrets. We never compromised our principles and we can leave this race knowing that we ran it with integrity and that we made an important contribution.
I want to thank my husband, Marcus, and my entire family. They, along with the Lord's provision of His incomprable faithfulness, have been my strength through the campaign. I look forward to the next chapter in God's plan—He has one for each of us, you know, if we will only cooperate with Him. He has always had something greater around the corner beyond what any of us could have ever imagined. I have lived an incredibly blessed life and am grateful to have been part of this presidential campaign.
Thank you, God Bless you and God Bless the United States of America.
