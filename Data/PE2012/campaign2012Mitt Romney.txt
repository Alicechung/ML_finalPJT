Remarks Announcing Candidacy for President in Stratham, New Hampshire

June 2, 2011

As prepared for delivery
Thank you for coming. And I want to thank Doug and Stella Scamman for hosting us on their beautiful farm.
You know, everyone here today can tell a different story. We have different backgrounds and we wake up in the morning and go to different jobs … or, look for different jobs. We go to different churches or maybe don't go to church so much. I bet some of you have families who go back 200 years or more in New Hampshire. And there must be some who just snuck in across the border, from Massachusetts. I hear the taxes are better over here.
But here we are on a beautiful June day coming together to begin a process that we often, quite naturally, take for granted. But it is really one of the great achievements in the history of the world. For all of our country's wealth and influence, those are not the source of our greatness. The true strength of America is self-rule, and a government that answers to a free and independent people.
We live in the most powerful nation that ever existed. And it all goes back to a few men and women who had the courage to stand - and even die - for their belief in liberty and equality. Because of their vision, the United States of America is not ruled by a monarchy or controlled by an aristocracy. Though sometimes folks in Washington might act otherwise, we don't have a House of Lords with inherited power. And as the Red Sox like to remind the New York Yankees, there are no dynasties in America.
Who rules this great nation?
You do. Every four years you decide who will give that State of the Union address, who will set the course of the country, who will be Commander in Chief.
What's true right here in this New Hampshire farm has always been true in America. Though each of us is different, though each of us will choose to walk a different path in life, we are united by one great, overwhelming passion: We love America. We believe in America.
Today we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America.
This country we love is in peril. And that, my friends, is why we are here today.
A few years ago, Americans did something that was, actually, very much the sort of thing Americans like to do: We gave someone new a chance to lead; someone we hadn't known for very long, who didn't have much of a record but promised to lead us to a better place.
At the time, we didn't know what sort of a President he would make. It was a moment of crisis for our economy, and when Barack Obama came to office, we wished him well and hoped for the best.
Now, in the third year of his four-year term, we have more than promises and slogans to go by.
Barack Obama has failed America.
When he took office, the economy was in recession. He made it worse. And he made it last longer.
Three years later, over 16 million Americans are out of work or have just quit looking. Millions more are underemployed.
Three years later, unemployment is still above 8%, a figure he said his stimulus would keep from happening.
Three years later, foreclosures are still at record levels.
Three years later the prices of homes continue to fall.
Three years later, our national debt has grown nearly as large as our entire economy.
Families are buried under higher prices for food and higher prices for gasoline.
It breaks my heart to see what's happening in this country.
These failing hopes make up President Obama's own misery index. It's never been higher. And what's his answer? He says this: "I'm just getting started."
No, Mr. President, you've had your chance. We, the people on this farm, and citizens across the country are the ones who are just getting started.
I visited with a family, Kathy and Dave Tyler, who live in a suburb north of Las Vegas, Nevada. You probably know families just like them. They're in their early forties, a couple who had worked hard, sacrificed to buy a home in a good neighborhood, the sort of place they wanted their daughter Allie to grow up. But now that neighborhood is being crushed by this Obama economy. First their neighbors started losing their jobs...and then their homes. And all around them now are abandoned houses... and abandoned dreams.
When the Tylers wake up in the morning and get Allie off to school and then go to work and do everything they can to make it to the end of the month and hold their lives together, it doesn't matter if they are Republican or Democrat, Independent or...Libertarian. They're just Americans. An American family.
And across the richest, greatest country on earth, there are millions of American families like the Tylers. Folks who grew up believing that if they played by the rules, worked hard, that they would have the chance to build a good life, with steady work and always that possibility to work a little harder and get ahead.
And in that America, you don't wonder if your children will have a better life. You know they will. You know it the same way we know that tomorrow morning the sun is going to come up in the East right over this field.
That confidence in a better tomorrow defines us as Americans.
When generations of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty for the first time, they surely had many questions and doubts about the life before them, but one thing they knew without a doubt is that they were coming to a place where anything was possible—that in America, their children would have a better life.
I believe in that America. I know you believe in that America. It is an America of freedom and opportunity. A nation where innovation and hard work propel the most powerful economy in the world. A land that is secured by the greatest military the world has ever seen, and by friends and allies across the globe.
President Obama sees a different America and has taken us in a different direction.
A few months into office, he travelled around the globe to apologize for America.
At a time of historic change and great opportunity in the Arab world, he is hesitant and uncertain. He hesitated to speak out for the dissidents in Iran, but his Administration boasts that he is "leading from behind" in Libya.
He speaks with firmness and clarity, however, when it comes to Israel. He seems firmly and clearly determined to undermine our longtime friend and ally. He's treating Israel the same way so many European countries have: with suspicion, distrust and an assumption that Israel is at fault.
To his credit, the President ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In Afghanistan, the surge was right, announcing a withdrawal date was wrong. The Taliban may not have watches, but they do have calendars.
Here at home, the President seems to take his inspiration not from the small towns and villages of New Hampshire but from the capitals of Europe.
With the economy in crisis, his answer is to borrow money we can't afford and throw it at Washington bureaucrats and politicians. Just like Europe.
Instead of encouraging entrepreneurs and employers, he raises their taxes, piles on record-breaking mounds of regulation and bureaucracy and gives more power to union bosses.
Instead of recognizing the states rightful authority to solve problems, he seizes power from them and rams through a disastrous national health care plan.
This President's first answer to every problem is to take power from you, your local government and your state so that so-called "experts" in Washington can make those choices for you. And with each of these decisions, we lose more of our freedom.
You and I understand this. We look at our country, and we know in our hearts that things aren't right, and they're not getting better.
President Obama's European answers are not the right solution to America's challenges.
In the campaign to come, the American ideals of economic freedom and opportunity need a clear and unapologetic defense, and I intend to make it—because I have lived it.
Twenty-seven years ago, I left a steady job to join with some friends to start a business. Like many of you, it had been a dream of mine to try and build a business from the ground up. We started in a small office a couple of hours from here and over the years, we were able to grow from ten employees to hundreds.
My work led me to become deeply involved in helping other businesses, from innovative startups to large companies going through tough times. Sometimes I was successful and helped create jobs, other times I was not. I learned how America competes with companies in other countries, what works in the real world and what doesn't.
I left my business in 1999 to help put the Salt Lake City Olympics back on track. And when the Games were over, I came home to Massachusetts and served as governor.
I'd never held office before but I went at it like I ran businesses and the Olympics: ask tough questions and take on the toughest problems first, because they'll only get worse.
When I took office, I faced a nearly $3 billion budget hole. My legislature was over 85% Democrat. The expectation was that we'd have to raise taxes but I refused. I ordered a review of all state spending, made tough choices and balanced the budget without raising taxes. That sent a message that business as usual was over.
Over the next four years, we consolidated agencies, cut programs, sold state property and cut taxes nineteen times. The state was giving away over a billion dollars in free health care, much of it to people who could have paid something but were gaming the system. You won't be surprised that a lot of Democrats thought we should be giving away even more.
I took it on and hammered out a solution that took a bad situation and made it better. Not perfect but it was a state solution for a state problem. At the end of four years, it took over 800 vetoes but we balanced every budget, restored a $2 billion dollar rainy day fund and kept our schools first among all 50 states.
All of these experiences -- starting and running businesses for 25 years, turning around the Olympics, governing a state -- have helped shape who I am and how I lead. Of course, if I ran through a list of all my mistakes, Ann would find it hilarious, and we'd be here all night. But I've learned a lot.
Turning around a crisis takes experienced leadership and bold action. For millions of Americans, the economy is in crisis today, and unless we change course, it will be in crisis for all of us tomorrow.
Government under President Obama has grown to consume almost 40% of our economy. We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy. I will cap federal spending at 20% or less of the GDP and finally, finally balance the budget.
My generation will pass the torch to the next generation, not a bill.
I will insist that Washington learns to respect the Constitution, including the 10th Amendment. We will return responsibility and authority to the states for dozens of government programs - and that begins with a complete repeal of Obamacare.
From my first day in office my number one job will be to see that America once again is number one in job creation. You know, if you want to create jobs, it helps to have had a job. I will make business taxes competitive with other nations, modernize regulations and bureaucracy and finally promote America's trade interests. It's time for a president who cares more about America's workers than he does about America's union bosses.
Over the last thirty years, I can't tell you how many times I've heard a situation is hopeless. But I've never been very good at listening to those people and I've always enjoyed proving them wrong.
It's one of the lessons I learned from my Dad.
My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed, as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On their honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels.
There were a lot reasons my father could have given up or set his sights lower. But Dad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors, and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint.
For my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where the circumstances of birth are no barrier to achieving one's dreams. Small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged, and respected, and a good worker could almost always find a good job.
The spirit of enterprise, innovation, pioneering and can-do propelled our standard of living and economy past every other nation on earth.
I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. We stand for freedom and opportunity and hope.
These last two years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a couple of years, we have not lost our way. The principles that made us a great nation and leader of the world have not lost their meaning. They never will.
We know we can bring this country back.
I'm Mitt Romney. I believe in America.
And I'm running for President of the United States.

Remarks at the 112th Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in San Antonio, Texas

August 30, 2011

It's a privilege to be addressing the veterans who defended our liberty in the past, and who defend the memory and dignity of every veteran today.
I was born in 1947 — a quintessential baby boomer. I grew up in the shadow of World War II, and then came the wars in Korea and Vietnam. As a boy, I knew that it was American soldiers and sailors and Marines and airmen who had saved us from German Fascism, and who protected us from Soviet Communism. You were our heroes then, and you are today.
You know better than most that the world is still infected with purveyors of hate and oppression. Some are jihadists, some are communists, and some are simply tyrants who clothe themselves in any convenient political manifesto. And so once again, American heroes are called upon to defend liberty.
We rightly call our fathers and mothers the Greatest Generation, but every man and woman who has or now defends American liberty — from the beaches of Normandy, to the Mekong Delta, to the valleys of the Hindu Kush — shares in their heritage of greatness. Every veteran is the greatest of his generation.
The quiet heroes who have fought for our country come from the most diverse backgrounds imaginable: from farmers and subway riders, Ph.D.'s and high school graduates, and from every ethnic background of the American melting pot. But they are united by far more than what divides them.
They believe in America. I believe in America. We believe in freedom and opportunity. We believe in the inherent dignity of every human being. We have a deep and abiding faith in the goodness and the greatness of America.
But today we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America.
25 million Americans are out of work, or have stopped looking, or have only part time jobs but want full-time work. Home values have dropped more than they did during the Depression. National debt is almost as large as our entire economy, and we owe a huge chunk of it to China. Incredibly, unfunded government promises now total about $530,000 per American household. This cannot possibly stand as the legacy we will leave the next generation.
And the peril of this mismanagement may even be more imminent. We stand near a threshold of profound economic misery. Four more years on the same political path could prove disastrous.
I am a conservative businessman. I have spent most of my life outside of politics, dealing with real problems in the real economy. Career politicians got us into this mess and they simply don't know how to get us out!
To win this fight for America's future, we will have to rise above politics. When members of Seal Team Six boarded their helicopters, they did so not as Republicans or Democrats or independents, they did so as Americans. And the final image that Osama bin Laden took with him straight to Hell was not a party symbol — not a Republican elephant or a Democratic donkey — but an American flag on the shoulder of one straight-shooting U.S. Navy Seal.
I start with the fundamental conviction that America is the greatest nation in the history of the world and a force for good. And while we are not perfect, I will not apologize for America!
Our president has taken a different approach. Have we ever had a president who was so eager to address the world with an apology on his lips and doubt in his heart? He seems truly confused not only about America's past but our future.
So critical was President Obama of America before the United Nations that Fidel Castro complimented him for his "courage" and "brave gesture." And Venezuelan dictator and thug Hugo Chavez joined in on the praise.
We can't lead the world by hoping our enemies will hate us less. Ronald Reagan rallied America with "Peace Through Strength."
American strength is the only guarantee of liberty. American strength turned the Cuban missiles around.
American strength caused the collapse of the Soviet Union. American strength yanked Saddam Hussein out of his spider hole. With freedom as our cause, strength is our only sure defense!
Today, President Obama is on a different course.
First, the White House proposed cutting military spending by $400 billion over the next twelve years. Then, President Obama agreed to a budget process that could entail cutting defense spending by $850 billion.
The incoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has called a cut of that magnitude "very high risk."
Defense Secretary Panetta has warned that it could have "devastating effects on our national defense." And that's coming from a guy who works for President Obama.
This is the first time in my memory that massive defense cuts were proposed without any reference to the missions that would be foreclosed and the risks to which our country and its men and women in uniform would be exposed. Cuts of this magnitude can only be the product of one of two mistaken beliefs.
On the one hand is wishful thinking that the world is becoming a safer place. The opposite is true. Consider simply the Jihadists, a near-nuclear Iran, a turbulent Middle East, an unstable Pakistan, a delusional North Korea, an assertive Russia, and an emerging global power called China. No, the world is not becoming safer.
And so, on the other hand, that leaves us with the belief that America should become a lesser power. It flows from the conviction that if we are weak, tyrants will choose to be weak as well; that if we could just talk more, engage more, pass more U.N. resolutions, that peace will break out. That may be what they think in that Harvard faculty lounge, but it's not what they know on the battlefield!
But American leadership is more than a budget fight. America must lead with clarity of intent, a commitment of purpose and unlimited resolve. Unfortunately, when we look around the world today, we see a muddled picture of American policy and power.
In the Mideast, we are pressuring our closest ally Israel to make concessions while putting almost no pressure on the Palestinians. The administration was quick to criticize Israel but slow to confront Syria's strongman, Bashar al Assad, even though he facilitated arming Hezbollah, allowed terrorists to cross his border into Iraq to attack U.S. troops, and turned weapons on his own people. Instead of calling Mr. Assad a reformer, the administration should have labeled him a killer.

Remarks to Republican National Hispanic Assembly in Tampa, Florida

September 2, 2011

As a nation of immigrants, we've found common ground not in our heritage but in our hearts. When generations looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty for the first time, or a piece of sandy beach that was freedom, or stepped off a plane traveling from tyranny to hope, these new Americans surely had many questions and doubts about the life before them.
But one thing they knew without a doubt is that they were coming to a place where anything was possible—that in America, their children, and their grandchildren, would have a better life.
That confidence in a better tomorrow defines us as Americans.
I believe in that America. I know you believe in that America. It is an America of freedom and opportunity. A nation where innovation and hard work propel the most powerful economy in the world. A land that is secured by the greatest military the world has ever seen.
But today, we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America.
25 million Americans are out of work, or have stopped looking, or have only part time jobs but want full-time work. Hispanics have been hit terribly hard, with an unemployment rate that is higher than the national one. Home values have dropped more than they did during the Depression and Florida has seen some of the worst of it. National debt is almost as large as our entire economy, and we owe a huge chunk of it to China.
This is not the legacy we want to leave our children. And the peril of this mismanagement may even be more imminent. We stand near a threshold of profound economic misery. Four more years on the same misguided political path would be disastrous. Career politicians got us into this mess and career politicians can't get us out!
I am a conservative businessman. I have spent most of my life outside of politics, solving real problems in the real economy.
Twenty-seven years ago, I joined with some friends to start a business. We started with ten employees, and grew it to become one of the most successful enterprises of its kind in the world.
My work led me to become deeply involved in helping other businesses, from innovative startups to large companies going through tough times. Sometimes I was successful and helped create jobs, other times I wasn't. I learned how America competes with companies in other countries, what works in the real world and what doesn't.
I left my business in 1999 to help put the Salt Lake City Olympics back on track. And when the Games were over, I came home to Massachusetts and served as governor.
I'd never held office before but I went at it like I ran businesses and the Olympics: ask tough questions, make tough decisions, and take on the toughest problems first, because they'll only get worse.
When I took office, I faced a nearly $3 billion budget hole. My legislature was over 85% Democrat. The expectation was that we'd have to raise taxes, but I refused. I ordered a review of all state spending, made tough choices and balanced the budget without raising taxes. That sent a message that business as usual was over.

The state was giving away over a billion dollars in free health care, much of it to people who could have paid something but were gaming the system. I took on a bad situation and made it better. Not perfect, but it was a state solution for a state problem.
At the end of four years, it took over 800 vetoes but we balanced every budget, restored a $2 billion dollar rainy day fund, and kept our schools first among all 50 states.
All of these experiences -- starting and running businesses for 25 years, turning around the Olympics, governing a state -- have helped shape who I am and how I lead.
Turning around a crisis takes experienced leadership and bold action. For millions of Americans, the economy is in crisis today, and unless we change course, it will be in crisis for all of us tomorrow.
To win this fight for America's future, we will have to rise above politics.
When members of Seal Team Six boarded their helicopters, they did so not as Republicans or Democrats or independents, they did so as Americans. And the final image that Osama bin Laden took with him straight to Hell was not a party symbol — not a Republican elephant or a Democrat donkey — but an American flag on the shoulder of one straight-shooting U.S. Navy Seal.

So critical was President Obama of America before the United Nations that Fidel Castro complimented him for his "courage" and "brave gesture." And Venezuelan dictator and thug Hugo Chavez joined in on the praise.
We can't lead the world by hoping our enemies—like the rogue regimes in Havana and Caracas—will hate us less.
Ronald Reagan rallied America with "Peace Through Strength." American strength is the only guarantee of liberty. American strength turned the Cuban missiles around. American strength caused the collapse of the Soviet Union. American strength yanked Saddam Hussein out of his spider hole. With freedom as our cause, strength is our only sure defense!
A strong America starts with a strong economy.
From my first day in office my number one job will be to see that America once again is number one in job creation.
On Tuesday, I will present a detailed plan to get America back to work and to grow our economy. It will be bold, sweeping and specific. But any plan is only as good as the person leading it. And you know, if we want to create jobs, it helps to have a President who has had a job!
I will make business taxes competitive with other nations, eliminate burdensome regulations and bureaucracy, and support America's workers instead of its union bosses.
I will promote the exploration of our own natural resources, which will create countless jobs.
I will make sure that America's workforce is prepared for the modern economy.
Government at all levels under President Obama has grown to consume almost 40% of our economy. We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy. I will cut federal spending, cap it at 20% or less of the GDP and finally, finally balance our budget.
We must pass a torch to the next generation, not a bill.
I will insist that Washington learns to respect the Constitution, including the 10th Amendment. We will return responsibility and authority to the states for dozens of government programs — and that begins with a complete repeal of Obamacare.
Finally, I will vigorously advance our trade interests around the world. That means ratifying pending agreements with allies like Colombia and Panama to create jobs right here in Florida and across America.
Three years ago, Candidate Obama promised to address the problems of illegal immigration in America. He failed. The truth is, he didn't even try.
I am a great proponent of legal immigration. Many of you are living proof of the unique strength of America that is constantly renewed by new Americans. The promise of America has brought some of the world's best and brightest to our shores. It's what brought Mel Martinez, the first Cuban-American U.S. Senator here. And it brought to America the parents of Marco Rubio, who is one of America's great leaders today.
I also believe that we must address illegal immigration in a way that is civil but resolute.
Our country must do a better job of securing its borders and as president, I will. That means completing construction of a high-tech fence, and investing in adequate manpower and resources.
We must also get tough on employers who hire illegal immigrants. That means putting in place an employment verification system that is both reliable and secure.
Finally, we must stop providing the incentives that promote illegal immigration. As governor, I vetoed legislation that would have provided in-state tuition rates to illegal immigrants and I strengthened the authority our state troopers had to enforce existing immigration laws.
As president, I promise to lead on this critical issue.
The people who came to America did not come for a handout. They came here for opportunity. The President and his party are about handouts and the redistribution of wealth. That is not what brought people to these shores. Our party is about freedom and opportunity. It's as simple as that. They believe in government, we believe in freedom and opportunity.
That's one of the lessons I learned from my Dad.
My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed, as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On their honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels.
There were a lot reasons my father could have given up or set his sights lower. But Dad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors, and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint.
For my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where the circumstances of birth are no barrier to achieving one's dreams. Small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged, and respected, and a good worker could almost always find a good job.
The spirit of enterprise, innovation, pioneering and can-do propelled our standard of living and economy past every other nation on earth. That spirit came from Main Street, not from Washington.
I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. We stand for freedom, opportunity and hope. And yes, we believe in American exceptionalism.
Under this President's weak leadership, we've lost a couple of years, but we have not lost our way. The principles that made us a great nation and leader of the world have not lost their meaning. They never will.
We know we can bring this country back.
Together, we can restore this great land we all love.
Thank you. God Bless America.

Remarks on U.S. Foreign Policy at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina

October 7, 2011

It's a great honor to be in South Carolina, where patriotism is a passion that tops even barbeque and football.
And it's a great honor to be here at the Citadel.
Every great university and college produces future engineers, doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs. Here at the Citadel, you do all that but you have another specialty - you produce heroes. Over 1400 of your alumni have served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere fighting the war against terrorism. And sixteen have paid the ultimate price.
Since 1842, every tyrant, petty thug or great power that threatened America learned that if you wanted to take on America, you were taking on the Citadel. That's a line of heroes that's never broken and never will be.
This is a true citadel of American honor, values and courage.
The other day I heard the President say that Americans had gone "soft." I guess he wasn't talking about how hard it is for millions of Americans who are trying to get a job or stretch a too small paycheck through the week.
As each of you looks beyond this great institution, to the life before you, I know you face many difficult questions in a world fraught with uncertainty. America is in an economic crisis the likes of which we have never seen in our lifetime. Europe is struggling with the greatest economic crisis since the Cold War, one that calls into question the very definition of the European Union.
Around the world we see tremendous upheaval and change. Our next President will face extraordinary challenges that could alter the destiny of America and, indeed, the future of freedom.
Today, I want you to join me in looking forward. Forward beyond that next Recognition Day, beyond Ring Weekend to four years from today, October 7th, 2015.
What kind of world will we be facing?
Will Iran be a fully activated nuclear weapons state, threatening its neighbors, dominating the world's oil supply with a stranglehold on the Strait of Hormuz? In the hands of the ayatollahs, a nuclear Iran is nothing less than an existential threat to Israel. Iran's suicidal fanatics could blackmail the world.
By 2015, will Israel be even more isolated by a hostile international community? Will those who seek Israel's destruction feel emboldened by American ambivalence? Will Israel have been forced to fight yet another war to protect its citizens and its right to exist?
In Afghanistan, after the United States and NATO have withdrawn all forces, will the Taliban find a path back to power? After over a decade of American sacrifice in treasure and blood, will the country sink back into the medieval terrors of fundamentalist rule and the mullahs again open a sanctuary for terrorists?
Next door, Pakistan awaits the uncertain future, armed with more than 100 nuclear weapons. The danger of a failed Pakistan is difficult to overestimate, fraught with nightmare scenarios: Will a nuclear weapon be in the hands of Islamic Jihadists?
China has made it clear that it intends to be a military and economic superpower. Will her rulers lead their people to a new era of freedom and prosperity or will they go down a darker path, intimidating their neighbors, brushing aside an inferior American Navy in the Pacific, and building a global alliance of authoritarian states?
Russia is at a historic crossroads. Vladimir Putin has called the breakup of the Soviet empire the great tragedy of the 20th Century. Will he try to reverse that tragedy and bludgeon the countries of the former Soviet Union into submission, and intimidate Europe with the levers of its energy resources?
To our South, will the malign socialism of Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, in tight alliance with the malign socialism of Castro's Cuba, undermine the prospects of democracy in a region thirsting for freedom and stability and prosperity?
Our border with Mexico remains an open sore. Will drug cartels dominate the regions adjoining the United States, with greater and greater violence spilling over into our country? Will we have failed to secure the border and to stem the tide of illegal immigrants? And will drug smugglers and terrorists increasingly make their way into our midst?
This would be a troubling and threatening world for America. But it is not unrealistic. These are only some of the very real dangers that America faces, if we continue with the feckless policies of the past three years.
But of course, it doesn't have to be this way. This isn't our destiny, it is a choice. We are a democracy. You decide. In this campaign for President, I will offer a very different vision of America's role in the world and of America's destiny.
Our next President will face many difficult and complex foreign policy decisions. Few will be black and white.
But I am here today to tell you that I am guided by one overwhelming conviction and passion: This century must be an American Century. In an American Century, America has the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world. In an American Century, America leads the free world and the free world leads the entire world.
God did not create this country to be a nation of followers. America is not destined to be one of several equally balanced global powers. America must lead the world, or someone else will. Without American leadership, without clarity of American purpose and resolve, the world becomes a far more dangerous place, and liberty and prosperity would surely be among the first casualties.
Let me make this very clear. As President of the United States, I will devote myself to an American Century. And I will never, ever apologize for America.
Some may ask, "Why America? Why should America be any different than scores of other countries around the globe?"
I believe we are an exceptional country with a unique destiny and role in the world. Not exceptional, as the President has derisively said, in the way that the British think Great Britain is exceptional or the Greeks think Greece is exceptional. In Barack Obama's profoundly mistaken view, there is nothing unique about the United States.
But we are exceptional because we are a nation founded on a precious idea that was birthed in the American Revolution, and propounded by our greatest statesmen, in our fundamental documents. We are a people who threw off the yoke of tyranny and established a government, in Abraham Lincoln's words, "of the people, by the people, and for the people."
We are a people who, in the language of our Declaration of Independence, hold certain truths to be self-evident: namely, that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. It is our belief in the universality of these unalienable rights that leads us to our exceptional role on the world stage, that of a great champion of human dignity and human freedom.
I was born in 1947, a classic baby boomer. I grew up in a world formed by one dominant threat to America: the Soviet Union and Communism. The "duck and cover" drills we learned in school during the Cuban Missile Crisis resulted from a threat by a known, identifiable enemy, with clear borders and established leaders. We needed spy planes to find the hidden missiles in Cuba but we didn't need them to find Nikita Khrushchev. President Reagan could negotiate with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and sign treaties for which each side could be held accountable. And when we caught the Soviets cheating, we could bring the world's attention to their transgressions.
Today, our world is far more chaotic. We still face grave threats, but they come not from one country, or one group, or one ideology. The world is unfortunately not so defined. What America and our allies are facing is a series of threatening forces, ones that overlap and reinforce each other. To defend America, and to secure a peaceful and prosperous world, we need to clearly understand these emerging threats, grasp their complexity, and formulate a strategy that deals with them before they explode into conflict.
It is far too easy for a President to jump from crisis to crisis, dealing with one hot spot after another. But to do so is to be shaped by events rather than to shape events. To avoid this paralyzing seduction of action rather than progress, a President must have a broad vision of the world coupled with clarity of purpose.
When I look around the world, I see a handful of major forces that vie with America and free nations, to shape the world in an image of their choosing. These are not exclusively military threats. Rather, they are determined, powerful forces that may threaten freedom, prosperity, and America's national interests.
- First, Islamic fundamentalism with which we have been at war since Sept. 11, 2001.
- Second, the struggle in the greater Middle East between those who yearn for freedom, and those who seek to crush it.
- The dangerous and destabilizing ripple effects of failed and failing states, from which terrorists may find safe haven.
- The anti-American visions of regimes in Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba—two of which are seeking nuclear weapons.
- And these forces include rising nations with hidden and emerging aspirations, like China, determined to be a world superpower, and a resurgent Russia, led by a man who believes the Soviet Union was great, not evil.
There is no one approach to these challenges. There is no Wall that the next President can demand to be torn down. But there is one unifying thread that connects each of these possible threats: when America is strong, the world is safer.
Ronald Reagan called it "Peace through Strength" and he was never more right than today. It is only American power—conceived in the broadest terms—that can provide the foundation of an international system that ensures the security and prosperity of the United States and our friends and allies around the world.
American strength rises from a strong economy, a strong defense, and the enduring strength of our values. Unfortunately, under this President, all three of those elements have been weakened.
As President, on Day One, I will focus on rebuilding America's economy. I will reverse President Obama's massive defense cuts. Time and again, we have seen that attempts to balance the budget by weakening our military only lead to a far higher price, not only in treasure, but in blood.
My strategy of American strength is guided by a set of core principles.
First, American foreign policy must be prosecuted with clarity and resolve. Our friends and allies must have no doubts about where we stand. And neither should our rivals. If the world knows we are resolute, our allies will be comforted and those who wish us harm will be far less tempted to test that resolve.
Second, America must promote open markets, representative government, and respect for human rights. The path from authoritarianism to freedom and representative government is not always a straight line or an easy evolution, but history teaches us that nations that share our values, will be reliable partners and stand with us in pursuit of common security and shared prosperity.
Third, the United States will apply the full spectrum of hard and soft power to influence events before they erupt into conflict. Resort to force is always the least desirable and costliest option. We must therefore employ all the tools of statecraft to shape the outcome of threatening situations before they demand military action. The United States should always retain military supremacy to deter would-be aggressors and to defend our allies and ourselves. If America is the undisputed leader of the world, it reduces our need to police a more chaotic world.
Fourth, the United States will exercise leadership in multilateral organizations and alliances. American leadership lends credibility and breeds faith in the ultimate success of any action, and attracts full participation from other nations. American leadership will also focus multilateral institutions like the United Nations on achieving the substantive goals of democracy and human rights enshrined in their charters. Too often, these bodies prize the act of negotiating over the outcome to be reached. And shamefully, they can become forums for the tantrums of tyrants and the airing of the world's most ancient of prejudices: anti-Semitism. The United States must fight to return these bodies to their proper role. But know this: while America should work with other nations, we always reserve the right to act alone to protect our vital national interests.
In my first 100 days in office, I will take a series of measures to put these principles into action, and place America—and the world—on safer footing.
Among these actions will be to restore America's national defense. I will reverse the hollowing of our Navy and announce an initiative to increase the shipbuilding rate from 9 per year to 15. I will begin reversing Obama-era cuts to national missile defense and prioritize the full deployment of a multilayered national ballistic missile defense system. I will order the formulation of a national cybersecurity strategy, to deter and defend against the growing threats of militarized cyber-attacks, cyber-terrorism, and cyber-espionage.
I will enhance our deterrent against the Iranian regime by ordering the regular presence of aircraft carrier task forces, one in the Eastern Mediterranean and one in the Persian Gulf region. I will begin discussions with Israel to increase the level of our military assistance and coordination. And I will again reiterate that Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.
I will begin organizing all of our diplomatic and assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with the authority and accountability necessary to train all our soft power resources on ensuring that the Arab Spring does not fade into a long winter.
I will launch a campaign to advance economic opportunity in Latin America, and contrast the benefits of democracy, free trade, and free enterprise against the material and moral bankruptcy of the Venezuelan and Cuban model.
I will order a full review of our transition to the Afghan military to secure that nation's sovereignty from the tyranny of the Taliban. I will speak with our generals in the field, and receive the best recommendation of our military commanders. The force level necessary to secure our gains and complete our mission successfully is a decision I will make free from politics.
And I will bolster and repair our alliances. Our friends should never fear that we will not stand by them in an hour of need. I will reaffirm as a vital national interest Israel's existence as a Jewish state. I will count as dear our Special Relationship with the United Kingdom. And I will begin talks with Mexico, to strengthen our cooperation on our shared problems of drugs and security.
This is America's moment. We should embrace the challenge, not shrink from it, not crawl into an isolationist shell, not wave the white flag of surrender, nor give in to those who assert America's time has passed. That is utter nonsense. An eloquently justified surrender of world leadership is still surrender.
I will not surrender America's role in the world. This is very simple: If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on Earth, I am not your President.
You have that President today.
The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity. My hope is that our grandchildren will remember us in the same way that we remember the past generations of Americans who overcame adversity, the generations that fought in world wars, that came through the Great Depression, and that gained victory in the Cold War. Let future generations look back on us and say, they rose to the occasion, they embraced their duty, and they led our nation to safety and to greatness.
The Greatest Generation is passing. But as their light fades, we must seize the torch they carried so gallantly at such sacrifice. It is an eternal torch of decency, freedom and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty — and honor — to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light.
Believe in America.
Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.

Remarks at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.

October 8, 2011

"I've been coming to this event for six years, and this is the biggest crowd yet. For that I suppose we should acknowledge President Obama. He's the conservative movement's top recruiter. Turns out, he really is a great community organizer. Although, I don't think we were the community he had in mind.
In almost every other way, President Obama has been a failure.
He faced a recession and he made it worse. He announced a recovery summer; a year and a half later, we're still waiting. 25 million Americans out of work or out of hope. Chronic unemployment is worse than at any time in recorded history. Home values and retirement funds have been devastated.
And all this didn't come cheap. In one term, he will have nearly amassed more debt than all our prior presidents combined. We needed stability and solvency … but we got Solyndra.
President Obama likes to remind us of what he inherited, with one glaring exception: he forgets to mention that he also inherited a triple A bond rating.
But now the American people are starting to do some downgrading of their own.
Last November, and in special elections since then, Americans have rejected the President's agenda. Just after his inauguration, he told the Today Show that if he couldn't turn the economy around in three years, he would be looking at a one-term proposition. Well, we're here to collect!
The President has just unveiled his latest jobs stimulus, and he's furious that we aren't enthusiastic. But Mr. President, we remember your last stimulus, the one you promised would hold unemployment below 8%. It ended up costing over a quarter of a million dollars for every job you said it saved or created. A quarter of a million dollars! And we remember your cash for clunkers program; that ended up costing $24,000 for every car. At the rate you're handing out government money, every American will end up having to pay your millionaire's tax!
President Obama has proved that maxim from Ronald Reagan—it's not that liberals are ignorant, it's that what they know is wrong!
You see, I think that to be able to create jobs, it helps to have had a job!
I spent my career in the private sector. I've met a payroll, and signed the front, as well as the back, of a payroll check. I've actually saved jobs and created jobs.
And I know what it takes to get America back to work.
Let me tell you some of the highlights of what I will do.
Beginning on day one of my presidency, I will take bold action to help grow our economy and create jobs.
I will issue an executive order that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver from "Obamacare" to all 50 states. Obamacare is a wolf in wolf's clothing—it's expensive, intrusive and unconstitutional. And that is why I will fight to repeal it.
I will put an end to the job-killing regulations imposed by the Obama administration.
I will open production of energy across the country. I'll remove the barriers to developing our coal, oil, and natural gas resources. I welcome renewable energy. But as an old venture capitalist myself, I can tell you this—there will be no more Solyndras!
I will promote free trade and open markets. And, for stealing our designs, patents and know-how, and for manipulating their currency to unfairly attack our industries and our jobs, I will finally clamp down on China.
I will protect the right of American workers to vote by secret ballot. And I will fight to stop union bosses from using the dues of their union members to support those bosses' favorite campaigns.
Those steps are just a start. The plan I have proposed, which you can download for free onto your Amazon Kindle or at my website, has 59 action steps. These actions will do something that is critically needed: they will make America once again the best place in the world for business, for investment, and for jobs.
Last week, the CEO of Coca-Cola said that the business environment in China is better than that here in the United States. China! If that is not an indictment of the Obama administration and of Washington, what is? It's time to let a conservative businessman take the reins of government to make sure that America, not China, is the economic powerhouse of the world!
There is a growing chorus in the country of people who believe America's day has passed. They believe that we must accommodate ourselves to a world of multiple balanced powers. But God did not create this country to be a nation of followers. America must lead the world, or someone else will.
I am guided by one overwhelming conviction and passion: this century must be an American Century. In an American Century, America has the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world. In an American Century, America leads the free world and the free world leads the entire world.
Let me make this perfectly clear. As President of the United States, I will devote myself to an American Century. And I will never, ever, apologize for America.
American strength rises from a strong economy, from a strong defense, and from the enduring strength of our values. Unfortunately, under this President, all three of those elements have been weakened.
I have already spoken of the actions I will take to strengthen our economy. To strengthen our military, I will reverse the President's cuts to the defense budget. Time and again, we have seen that attempts to balance the budget by weakening our military only lead to a far higher price, not only in treasure, but in blood.
I will modernize our Navy and Air Force, add active duty soldiers, restore a robust missile defense system, and give our veterans the world-class care they deserve.
And I will repair our alliances. Our friends should never fear that we will not stand by them in an hour of need. I will reaffirm as a vital national interest Israel's existence as a Jewish state. I will count as dear our special relationship with the United Kingdom. And I will begin talks with Mexico to strengthen our cooperation on our shared problems of drugs and security.
This is America's moment. I will not surrender America's role in the world. This is very simple: if you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your president.
You have that President today.
The foundation needed for a strong economy and a strong military is a people of strong values.
The values I learned in my home have enriched my life immeasurably. I had a mother and a father at home. What a blessing that was. My parent's example led me to marry, to have children, and now to bask in the joy of 16 grandchildren.
For the last 42 years, Ann has been my partner and joy. And what she has done has brought more happiness and meaning to our lives than what I have done, for Ann took the lead in raising our sons.
Steve Jobs was asked whether he was glad that he had children. He said, "it's 10,000 times better than anything I have ever done."
But marriage is more than a personally rewarding social custom. It is also critical for the well-being of a civilization. That is why it's so important to preserve traditional marriage — the joining together of one man and one woman. And that's why I will appoint an Attorney General who will defend the bipartisan law passed by Congress and signed by Bill Clinton — the Defense of Marriage Act.
Unfortunately, when it comes to marriage, our government's policies are often out of step with our values. If a couple has a baby, the government will actually give them more support—in the form of food stamps, welfare, or other benefits—if they do not marry than if they do. Our safety-net programs penalize the decision to marry, instead of rewarding it. That's just wrong. And that's why I will eliminate these marriage penalties. And I will hold fathers financially responsible for their child, whether or not they have married the mother.
Our values must also encompass the life of an unborn child. There are, of course, strong convictions on both sides of the life issue. Yet, it speaks well of our country that almost all Americans recognize that abortion is a problem. The law may call it a right, but no one ever called it a good. And in the quiet of conscience, people of both political parties know that more than a million abortions a year cannot be squared with the good heart of America.
I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. As president, I will end federal funding for abortion advocates like Planned Parenthood. I will protect a health care worker's right to follow their conscience in their work. And I will nominate judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the law. It is long past time for the Supreme Court to return the issue of abortion back to the states, by overturning Roe v. Wade.
Because the good heart of America knows no boundaries, a commitment to protecting life should not stop at the water's edge.
Taking innocent life is always wrong and always tragic, wherever it happens. The compassionate instincts of this country should not be silent in the face of injustices like China's One-Child Policy. And if I am president, you will never hear me or my vice president tell the Chinese government that we "understand" and won't "second guess" compulsory sterilization and forced abortion.
Almost all Americans live for a purpose greater than ourselves. Our heritage of religious faith and tolerance has importantly shaped who we have become as a people. We must continue to welcome faith into the public square and allow it to flourish. Our government should respect religious values, not silence them. We will always pledge our allegiance to a nation under God.
Our values ennoble the citizen, and strengthen the nation. We should remember that decency and civility are values too. One of the speakers who will follow me today, has crossed that line. Poisonous language does not advance our cause. It has never softened a single heart nor changed a single mind. The blessings of faith carry the responsibility of civil and respectful debate. The task before us is to focus on the conservative beliefs and the values that unite us — let no agenda, narrow our vision or drive us apart.
The 21st century must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity. My hope is that our grandchildren will remember us in the same way that we remember the last generations of Americans who overcame adversity, that fought in world wars, that came through the Great Depression, and that gained victory in the Cold War. Let future generations look back on us and say they rose to the occasion, they embraced their duty, and they led our nation to safety and strength.
The greatest generation is passing. But as their light fades, we must seize that torch they carried so gallantly at such great sacrifice. It is an eternal torch of decency, freedom and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty--and honor--to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light.
Believe in America.
Thank you. God Bless You, and God Bless the United States of America."

Remarks at the Americans for Prosperity Conference in Washington, D.C.

November 4, 2011

As I'm sure you've noticed, the President has been traveling the country trying to get support for his new half-a-trillion-dollar stimulus bill.
He keeps telling people, "We can't wait." To which I say, "Yes, we can."
Upon taking office, this administration's motto was "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste." Since then, it's become clear that they don't know how to end one.
The unemployment rate has been over 8% for 33 months. Our country has been running a deficit for 36 months. And just last week, nearly 400,000 Americans filed new jobless claims.
We know that's not the best America can do. That's just the best this administration can do. We will do a lot better.
Over the last 33 months, President Obama has offered a number of plans for getting the economy going. The problem is that most of his proposals are based on one idea: More spending and borrowing. Today, government borrows 36 cents of every dollar it spends. If we stay on the present course, we will face tomorrow what Greece, Italy, and Spain face today. But there is no nation big enough to bail us out.
It took 43 presidents over 200 years to accumulate $6.3 trillion of national debt. President Obama is on track to borrow and spend nearly that much in just one term.
His fundamental error is that he believes government creates jobs and opportunity. He's wrong. He puts his faith in government. I put my faith in people.
That is why I will make government simpler, smaller, and smarter.
This is not only good for the economy, it is a moral imperative. We cannot with moral conscience borrow trillions of dollars that can only be repaid by our children. We cannot so weaken our economic foundation that we jeopardize our ability to preserve freedom.
There are some who argue that fiscal responsibility is heartless and immoral. No, what is heartless is to imperil our children. And what is immoral is to imperil the strength of the nation that was founded "under God" and preserved by His hand.
This is a pivotal moment in the history of the country. We will either be led by men and women who care only for the present, who promise more and ask for less, and who ignore the tightening noose of debt–or we will be led by those who believe that deficits matter and who have the courage to act with fiscal responsibility.
When I became the Governor of Massachusetts in 2003, the state budget was out of control. My legislature was 85% Democrat. Some thought we should just raise taxes or borrow more money. I said no.
Even with about the most Democratic legislature in the nation, we didn't just slow the growth of spending, we cut spending. And we turned a $3 billion budget shortfall into a $2 billion rainy day fund.
I learned how to balance budgets in business. In the private sector, you have no choice—you either balance your budget or you go broke. And you spend every dollar like it's your own, because it is.
Someone should have told that to Solyndra. The federal government gave them a $535 million loan guarantee to build a factory in Fremont, California. The footprint covered 5 football fields. They had robots that whistled Disney songs. I am not kidding. They had "spa-like showers with liquid-crystal displays of the water temperature." The company headquarters was called the "Taj Mahal" of office buildings. That's how government starts a company.
Let me compare Solyndra with Staples, a company I helped get started. Our headquarters was located in the back of an empty food warehouse. We got some used office furniture – old Naugahyde chairs. You had to be an athlete to get out of them. Every penny we had went into selling the product and attracting new customers.
That's a difference between the private sector and government–fiscal responsibility.
I took my business experience and brought it to the Olympics. I came at a time when the Games were in crisis. We had a $370 million budget deficit, and some said the Games would fail.
The first thing we did was change the culture. We started with small, but symbolic gestures. We stopped renting fancy conference rooms for board meetings and charged board members $1 for a can of Coke and $1 for a slice of pizza.
We cut the budget for things like decorations, brochures, travel, and motivational speakers. We could get all the motivation we needed from the performance of our athletes. We wanted the entire organization to know that every penny mattered.
I used the commonsense principles I had relied on so many times in the private sector to come up with $98 million in immediate budget cuts. When it was all said and done, our Olympics were among the most successful ever, and instead of a deficit, we produced $100 million dollars for an endowment fund.
In business, in the Olympics, and in Massachusetts, I've learned how to eliminate deficits and to produce results. When I get to the White House, no one will need to teach me how to balance budgets. I've been doing that for 35 years.
It is time to level with the American people about what it will take to cut spending and balance our budget, to set honest goals and present a credible plan to achieve them.
This won't be easy. It requires tough choices. Many believe it can't be done. I believe it must be done. I believe in the American people. When the nation calls, Americans deliver.
Over the last 33 months, President Obama has grown federal spending to 24% of the economy, 24% of the GDP. As president, I pledge to reduce spending to 20% of GDP by the end of my first term. I will cap it at that level. And further, I will put us on a path to a balanced budget and a constitutional amendment that requires the government to spend only what it earns.
To reach the 20% goal, we'll need to find almost $500 billion in savings a year in 2016.
Upon taking office, I will immediately cut discretionary spending and submit a budget that returns spending to pre-Obama levels.
However, as I said at the Citadel, I will reverse President Obama's massive defense cuts. Any savings we will find in the defense budget we will re-direct to rebuild our navy and our air force, to add active duty soldiers and sailors, and to provide the care our veterans deserve. The world has not become a less dangerous place. We must preserve our commitment to a military that is so strong, no nation would ever think of testing it.
My roadmap to a smaller, simpler government combines three separate approaches.
First, eliminate and cut programs.
That will start with the easiest cut of all: I will repeal Obamacare. This alone will save us $95 billion a year. It's bad law, bad policy, and when I'm president, the bad news of Obamacare will be over.
There are many other federal programs that we must either dramatically scale back or cut out entirely. For each program, I will ask this question – "is this program so critical, so essential, that we should borrow money from China to pay for it?"
I like Amtrak, but I'm not willing to borrow $1.6 billion a year to subsidize it. I like the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but I refuse to borrow almost $1 billion a year from China to pay for them.
And then there's foreign aid. Did you know that we give $27 million a year in foreign aid to China? I will stop sending money to any country that can take care of itself. And no foreign aid will go to countries that oppose American interests.
We spend $300 million a year on groups like Planned Parenthood, which provide abortions or abortion-related services. It's long past time for that to be over.
So first, we will eliminate or cut programs that are not absolutely essential.
Second, we return numerous federal programs to the states. That's because innovation, cost management, and reduction of fraud and abuse can far exceed what Washington is able to achieve.
Medicaid is a prime example. We need to turn Medicaid back to the states and allow them to craft the healthcare solutions that suit their citizens best. By limiting the growth of Medicaid funding to CPI plus one percent, we will save $100 billion a year.
Today, nine federal agencies run 47 different federal worker retraining programs at a cost of $18 billion a year. Just imagine how much is spent on overhead. I will send those workforce training dollars back to the states, empowering them to retrain workers in ways that fit the needs of their respective economies. In the process, we can save billions of dollars.
Finally, in addition to cutting programs and returning programs to states, there is a third approach to reining-in federal spending. It is to impose far greater productivity and efficiency on government itself, just like is regularly done in every successful business in the country.
Let me give you an example of just how out of control government has become. Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman reports that during the Second World War, we commissioned 1000 ships a year, and the Navy purchasing department that year, which they called the Bureau of Ships, had 1000 employees. By the time John was Secretary during the Reagan Administration, we commissioned 17 ships a year. And Navy purchasing had grown to 4,000 people. Today, we commission 9 ships a year. And purchasing? It's grown to 24,000 people. A business like that would be out of business.
We must cut the size of the federal workforce. On President Obama's watch, we've added more than 140,000 federal workers. The American people are increasingly working to support the government. It should be the other way around.
I will reduce the federal payroll by at least 10%, saving $3.5 billion a year. And we can save billions more by cutting extraneous federal contractors.
It's not just the size of the federal workforce, it's also the cost. Since President Obama took office, the number of federal workers making $150,000 or more has doubled.
I will limit the salaries and benefits of workers in the public sector to those for workers in the private sector. Public servants should not get a better deal than the taxpayers they work for. By linking government pay with private sector pay, we will save as much as $47 billion a year.
There are still other ways to make the federal government work more efficiently and effectively. We will attack the rampant fraud that exists in numerous government programs by enacting far stiffer penalties for those who steal from taxpayers. Cutting improper payments in half can save more than $60 billion a year. And we can save nearly $11 billion a year by repealing a political giveaway that protects unions from competition and drives up the cost of government contracts: it's time to repeal Davis Bacon.
We will also find savings by combining certain government agencies and departments. For example, it makes very little sense that trade policies and programs are administered by so many offices in so many departments. Today, trade matters are housed in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, the International Trade Commission, the International Trade Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of the Treasury. And guess who gathers our trade data? None of the above; it's the Census Bureau. Too many chefs not only spoil the broth, they make it inedible and prohibitively expensive.
In sum, I will make the federal government simpler, smaller, and smarter by eliminating programs, by sending programs back to the states, and by making government more productive. I will provide for the national defense, enforce our laws, preserve our safety net, and honor all our promises to our elderly. This is the right course for a moral nation.
Deficits do in fact matter. They matter if we want to convince entrepreneurs to start businesses. They matter if we want employers to start hiring. They matter if America is to avoid the shoals of economic calamity. They matter if America is to remain the shining city on a hill. To those who say that deficits don't matter, to those who spend and borrow to win the praise of the short-sighted, we assert that you are in the wrong, and we are in the right.
My dad used to say that "the pursuit of the difficult makes men strong." Our next president is going to face difficult choices. Among these will be the future of Social Security and Medicare. In their current form, these programs will go bankrupt. I know that, you know that, and even our friends in the other party know that. The difference is that I will be honest about strengthening and preserving them, and they won't.
President Obama has failed to articulate a single serious idea to save Social Security.
I believe we can save Social Security with a few commonsense reforms. First, there will be no change for retirees or those near retirement. No change. Second, for the next generation of retirees, we should slowly raise the retirement age. And, finally, for the next generation of retirees, we should slow the growth in benefits for those with higher incomes.
While President Obama has been silent on Social Security, his agenda for Medicare is disastrous. He's the only president in modern history who has cut Medicare for seniors—do not forget, it was President Obama who cut $500 billion from Medicare, not to preserve it or sustain it, but to pay for his vaunted Obamacare. And he put the future of Medicare in the hands of 15 unelected bureaucrats. These bureaucrats have the power to enact further cuts to Medicare without congressional approval, even if those cuts overturn a law previously passed by Congress. President Obama's so-called Medicare reforms could lead to the rationing or denial of care for seniors on Medicare.
Unlike President Obama, our next president must protect Medicare, improve the program, and keep it sustainable for generations to come. Several principles will guide my efforts.
First, Medicare should not change for anyone in the program or soon to be in it. We should honor our commitments to our seniors.
Second, as with Social Security, tax hikes are not the solution. We couldn't tax our way out of unfunded liabilities so large, even if we wanted to.
Third, tomorrow's seniors should have the freedom to choose what their health coverage looks like. Younger Americans today, when they turn 65, should have a choice between traditional Medicare and other private healthcare plans that provide at least the same level of benefits. Competition will lower costs and increase the quality of healthcare for tomorrow's seniors.
The federal government will help seniors pay for the option they choose, with a level of support that ensures all can obtain the coverage they need. Those with lower incomes will receive more generous assistance. Beneficiaries can keep the savings from less expensive options, or they can choose to pay more for a costlier plan.
Finally, as with Social Security, the eligibility age should slowly increase to keep pace with increases in longevity.
These ideas will give tomorrow's seniors the same kinds of choices that most Americans have in their healthcare today. The future of Medicare should be marked by competition, choice, and innovation—rather than bureaucracy, stagnation, and bankruptcy. Our path for the future of Social Security and Medicare is honesty and security, theirs is demagoguery and deception.
The plan I propose to make government simpler, smaller, and smarter represents the biggest fundamental change to the federal government in modern history. It is a change we must make if the words "full faith and credit of the United States" are to mean anything at all.
We're not the first people to come to this realization. And we won't be the first people to be criticized for believing that responsibility is a virtue.
President Ronald Reagan shared our conviction.
In his first inaugural address, he said:
"It is not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work — work with us, not over us; stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it."
The task before us now is to reaffirm our conviction in the beliefs and values that unite us … in the challenges and opportunities that face us … and in the victory that awaits us.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.

Remarks in Bedford, New Hampshire

December 20, 2011

Six months ago, I launched my campaign for the Presidency not far from here on a perfect New Hampshire summer day. 
I spoke of an America in peril, under a President who had disappointed even his own supporters and was clearly failing. Since then, the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. More Americans have lost their homes and more Americans have slipped from the middle class into a world of poverty they never imagined.  Our soldiers return from war unable to find a decent job. 
Over the last six months, I've travelled up and down New Hampshire and across America. I've listened to anxious voices in town meetings, visited with students who are frightened by the magnitude of their college loans but even more frightened by the lack of good jobs.  From break rooms to back offices to living rooms, I've heard stories of the The Great Obama Recession. Of families getting by on less, of long planned-for retirements replaced by two jobs at minimum wage. It's a long litany of dreams deferred and economic stress that quickly become family stress. I've heard stories that will break your heart. 
But let me tell you what I rarely heard — hopelessness. 
Even in these most difficult times, the worst economy since the Great Depression, I've found Americans refusing to believe that these troubled days are our destiny. Sometimes with pride, often with anger, I've heard time and again, a constant refrain: This is not the America we love! This is not the America we deserve! That this is not the America of yesterday and we will not allow it to become the America of tomorrow! 
We are Americans. And we will not surrender our dreams to the failures of this President.  We are bigger than the misguided policies and weak leadership of one man. America is bigger than President Obama's failures! 
This America of long unemployment lines and small dreams is not the America you and I love. It is not a Live Free or Die America. These troubled years are President Obama's legacy but they are not our future!
This is an election not to replace a President but to save a vision of America. It's a choice between two destinies. 
Four years ago, many Americans trusted candidate Barack Obama when he promised to bring Americans together. But now we've learned that President Obama's idea of bringing us together is not to lift us up but instead to use the invisible boot of government to bring us all down.
I have a vision of a very different America, an America united not by our limits but by our ambitions, our hopes and our shared dreams. I am tired of a President who wakes up every day, looks out across America and is proud to announce, "It could be worse." 
It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse? 
No.
If I am President I will wake up every day and remind Americans that not only must we do better but also that we can do better!  I believe in America! 
President Obama boasts that he will "fundamentally transform" America.  I want to restore America to our founding principles. 
I believe that our founding principles are what made America the greatest nation in the world.   
Among these core principles is what the founders called the "pursuit of happiness." We call it opportunity, or the freedom to choose our course in life.  That principle is the foundation of a society that is based on ability, not birthright. 
In a merit-based society, people achieve their dreams through hard work, education, risk-taking, and even a little luck.  An opportunity society produces pioneers and inventors; it inspires its citizens to build and create. As these people exert effort and take risks, they employ and lift others and create prosperity. 
Their success does not make others poorer, it makes others better off. 
President Obama sees America differently.  He believes in an entitlement society.
Once we thought "entitlement" meant that Americans were entitled to the privilege of trying to succeed in the greatest country in the world. Americans fought and died to earn and protect that entitlement. But today the new entitlement battle is over the size of the check you get from Washington.
President Barack Obama has reversed John Kennedy's call for sacrifice. He would have Americans ask, "what can the country do for you?"
Just a couple of weeks ago in Kansas, President Obama lectured us about Teddy Roosevelt's philosophy of government.  But he failed to mention the important difference between Teddy Roosevelt and Barack Obama.  Roosevelt believed that government should level the playing field to create equal opportunities.  President Obama believes that government should create equal outcomes.  
In an entitlement society, everyone receives the same or similar rewards, regardless of education, effort, and willingness to take risk. That which is earned by some is redistributed to the others. And the only people who truly enjoy any real rewards are those who do the redistributing—the government.
The truth is that everyone may get the same rewards, but virtually everyone will be worse off.
President Obama's entitlement society would demand a massive growth of government. To preserve opportunity, we must shrink government not grow it. 
Last month, I laid out specific solutions to the spending crisis we are facing, including Medicare reform.  I'm very pleased to see that Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, who has been a champion of reform, has joined with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon to push a similar Medicare reform package that I hope will save this critical program. 
But this is more than a spending crisis we face. Even if we could afford the ever-expanding payments, an "entitlement society" is a fundamental corruption of the American spirit.  The battle we face today is more than a fight over our budget, it's a battle for America's soul. 
We can't begin to answer the question of who should be our next President until we start asking ourselves, "Who are we as Americans, and what kind of America do we want for our children?" 
I know that my answers to those questions are very different than those of the current President of the United States.
President Obama has spent the last 35 months building a government so large that feeding it will have to consume a greater and greater share of your paycheck. And does anybody in America believe they are better off today than four years ago?
He pushed through Obamacare, an entitlement program we didn't want and can't afford.
He's refused to advance a responsible plan to strengthen existing entitlements.  Instead of fostering competition and choice, he's cultivating government dependence.
President Obama talks about a country where everyone plays by the same rules, but when it comes to his favorite friends, he makes sure the rules don't apply.  He's given his supporters waivers exempting them from the burden of Obamacare.  His NLRB bullies businesses when they don't bow to union demands.  In the energy industry, he's picked winners — who turned out to be real losers — like Solyndra.  
That's how an entitlement society works — those in government control the resources and make the rules.  And while the rest of us stand still, they make sure that their friends get ahead.
The result of President Obama's approach is a staggering list of failures. It took eighteen tax increases just to get Obamacare off the ground.  Our growing welfare state is slated to cost $10.3 trillion over the next 10 years, that's $72.000 a household.  
I will take a different path. 
I will repeal Obamacare.  On the first day as president, I will issue waivers from Obamacare to all 50 states.
I will strengthen Medicare by empowering the next generation of seniors to choose the solutions that are right for them.  And I'll send Medicaid back to the states because they know how to serve their citizens best.   
My administration will create an environment where the private sector can thrive and American businesses can reach their full potential.  I'll reduce federal regulation, open up new markets, and fully exploit our energy resources.  
I'll cut taxes, cap spending and finally balance the budget. 
This time next year, all the yard signs will have come down; Town Hall meetings will be about local budgets, not the defense department or Medicare.  It'll be safe to watch television again, at least for a little while. Americans will have chosen. 
The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle-to-grave assurances that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise more benefits, that's a battle I'm not going to join.
This will be a campaign about the soul of America, about American greatness.  I'm confident that Americans won't settle for an excuse that "it could be worse."  I'm confident that Americans will refuse to be bought off by cheap promises that turn into never-ending debts for our children and grandchildren. 
This is a time when we look beyond who we are today and ask who we will become.
Not far from here, an idea called America was born. It came in a moment when a peaceful people realized they could not continue on the same path. Those farmers and merchants, aristocrats and blacksmiths, put aside their fears to take up arms against the greatest power in the world. There was not a single rational reason to believe they could succeed. 
But they believed in God and they believed in themselves. They believed that the guiding force in their lives should not be fear, but rather a strong belief that life without freedom is slow death and an abiding conviction that they could build a better world. 
That world is America. 
Here in New Hampshire, in Iowa, South Carolina, Florida, Michigan — across America — we are at the beginning of a democratic process that those early patriots risked all to secure. This is the moment when we reject failure and commit to make the disappointments of the past few years only a detour, not a destiny. We believe America can do better. Because we believe in America.
And tonight, I ask each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember what it was like to be hopeful and excited about the future, not to dread each new headline. When you spent more time looking for a house to buy than searching for a new job; when you spent more time thinking about a vacation with your family than how to make it to the next paycheck.  
That America is still out there. An America when you weren't afraid to look at your retirement savings or the price at the pump. 
An America when you never had to wake up to hear a President apologizing for America. 
I say let's fight for that America. The America that brings out the best in each of us, that challenges us to be better and bigger than ourselves. 
This election, let's fight for the America we love. 
We believe in America. 
Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.

Remarks in Des Moines Following the Iowa Caucuses

January 3, 2012

We don't know what the final vote tally is going to be, but congratulations to Rick Santorum. This has been a great victory for him and for his effort. He's worked very hard in Iowa. We -- we also feel it's been a great victory for us here. [applause]
Ron Paul as well. Ron Paul has had a great night. This is -- this has been terrific. I think it's great that here in the heartland of America that a campaign begins. All three of us will be campaigning very hard to make sure that we restore the heart and soul of the entire nation.
And thank you, Iowa, for the great send-off you're giving to us and to the others in this campaign. Look, this is -- this is a campaign night where America wins. We're going to change the White House and get America back on track. [applause]
I'm -- I'm proud tonight to have been introduced by my sweetheart of -- well, I was going to say 42 years, but we've been married 42 years. We've been sweethearts for longer than that. And behind her, four of our five sons. One of our sons, Ben, is a resident at a hospital so he can't be here tonight, but this has been a family affair for us and in this room we feel like family with you. You guys have been extraordinary. [applause]
This -- for those that don't know, this -- this volunteer team has done extraordinary work. I mean, I hope you understand. When I ran four years ago, we had 52 members of our full-time staff. This campaign, we've had five. And you guys have done the work under the work of Dave Kochell and Sara Craig. They are just heroic. Thanks, you two, for the work you've done. [applause]
And -- and you were working -- again, I am working and we're all working together because of our passion for this country and our concern that it's being led by a president who may be a nice guy, but just is over his head. And you look at -- I mean, I look -- I look at his campaign. You know, four years ago tonight, he was giving a victory celebration speech here in Des Moines.
And he'd been going across the state making all sorts of promises. The gap between his promises four years ago and his performance is as great as anything I've ever seen in my life. We face an extraordinary challenge in America. You know that. And that is, internationally, Iran is about to have nuclear weaponry just down the road here. And this president, what's he done in that regard? He said he'd have a policy of engagement. How's that worked out?
All right, we -- we...
Yeah, not terribly well. We -- we have no -- no sanctions of a severe nature, crippling sanctions put in place. The president was silent when dissident voices took to the streets in Iran. And of course, he hasn't prepared the military options that would -- would present credibly our ability to -- to take out the threat that would be presented by Iran. He's failed on that.
And then how about with regards to the economy? He went out and borrowed $787 billion and his administration said they'd hold unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below 8 percent since. You've got 25 million people today out of work or stopped looking for work or unable to get the kind of job that will allow them to meet their -- their needs.
This is -- this is not just a statistic, by the way, these 25 million people; this -- this unemployment of 8.5 percent. These are real people whose lives have been impacted severely, people who -- who lose their jobs over a long period of time. They sometimes lost their marriages, lost their faith, become depressed. This is just a tragedy and didn't need to happen. Almost everything the president has done has made it harder for businesses to grow and to hire and to put people back to work.
And then, of course, there's one more aspect of his track record that's been a failure. He was critical of President Bush for not balancing the budget; for having such large deficits. His deficits have been three times larger or more. He's on track by the end of his first term -- his only term, by the way... [applause]
He's on track -- he's on track to put almost as much public debt in place as all the prior presidents combined. This has been a failed presidency. And I'm absolutely convinced that if we want to get jobs again in this country, it's going to be helpful to have a person who's had a job in the private sector to create jobs in the private sector. [applause]
You know, he said three years ago that after being inaugurated, he was on the Today Show, and he said, "Look, if I can't get this economy turned around in three years, I'll be looking at one-term proposition." And we are here to collect, let me tell you. [applause]
I will go to work to get America back to work by making America once again the most attractive place in the world for jobs creators and innovators and investors and jobs -- the jobs will begin to flow like they have in the past. I'll keep our tax rates competitive; get regulators and regulations to see their job is to encourage enterprise; make sure we open up new markets for American goods; and finally take advantage of the energy resources we have here in oil and gas and coal and nuclear and renewables. [applause]
And I'll also do the work of finally getting ourselves to cut our federal spending and capping how much we spend and balancing our budget. I -- I think it's immoral for us to continue to spend our kids' future year after year, trillions of dollars passed onto the next generation, knowing we can't possibly pay it back. It's wrong, and under my administration it'll end. [applause]
And I -- and you've heard me say this before. I've been asked, "How are you going to cut programs?"
And I'm going to look at all the programs we have in the federal government and I'm going to ask with regard to each one of them, "Is that program so critical that it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?"
And on that basis, we're going to have a lot of programs we can get rid of, and number one on the list is Obamacare. That'll be gone. [applause]
But this election is bigger even than jobs and a strong economy. It's bigger than a budget that's balanced and deficits and debt that begins to be reduced. It's really an election about the soul of America. The question is, are we going to continue to hue to the vision of the founders.
When they crafted this country and wrote the Declaration of Independence they said that the Creator had endowed us with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And that word -- that phrase, "pursuit of happiness," deals with the opportunity associated with this great nation. We are an opportunity land. People came from all over the world seeking freedom electorally but also freedom personally, able to choose their own course in life, they came to America.
And by virtue of their successes, their passion, their energy, their pioneering, they helped lift the entire nation. They didn't make us poorer by their being successful, they made us as a nation better off.
The president has a different view. Instead of seeing a merit society, an opportunity society, I think he takes his inspiration from the social welfare states of Europe. He wants to make us an entitlement society where government takes from some to give to others. The only people who do well in that setting are the people in the government who do the taking from one to give to the others.
The right course for America is to remain a merit society, an opportunity nation. [applause]
The right course for America economically, personally, morally is for America to restore the principles that made us the shining city on the hill, our conviction that freedom is a gift of God, our recognition that America as a merit society where people, based upon their education, their -- their hard work, their risk-taking, their dreams can lift themselves and lift people around them and lift our entire nation. That's what we need to restore in this country.
I love this country. I love the hymns of America: "America the Beautiful", "O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain" -- corn counts -- doesn't it? -- as an amber wave of grain. [laughter]
Yes.
Another favorite verse, "O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, the more than self their country loved and mercy more than life."
Do we have any veterans in the room tonight? Please raise your hand to be recognized. [applause]
And one more verse let me just quote: "O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years."
The patriots, the founders of this country had a dream that was not just for their time, but was an enduring dream. It seized onto our time.
I don't want to do as the president says, to fundamentally transform America into something we might not recognize. I want to restore the principles that made America the hope of the Earth. I love our freedoms. I love our Constitution. I love our land. I love our people. And I love the fact that this is a land of opportunity.
Let us restore the greatness of America and keep this land the hope of the Earth.
Thank you so much for all your help. [applause]
On to New Hampshire. On to New Hampshire. Let's get that job done.
Come visit us there. We've got some work ahead.
Thanks, guys. [applause]

Remarks in Manchester Following the New Hampshire Primary

January 10, 2012

Thank you, New Hampshire! Tonight, we made history!
This state has always been a special place for our family. Ann and I made a home here and we've filled it with great memories of our children and grandchildren. And this Granite State moment is one we will always remember.
Tonight, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we go back to work.
We remember when Barack Obama came to New Hampshire four years ago.
He promised to bring people together.
He promised to change the broken system in Washington.
He promised to improve our nation.
Those were the days of lofty promises made by a hopeful candidate. Today, we are faced with the disappointing record of a failed President. The last three years have held a lot of change, but they haven't offered much hope.
The middle class has been crushed. Nearly 24 million of our fellow Americans are still out of work, struggling to find work, or have just stopped looking. The median income has dropped 10% in four years. Soldiers returning from the front lines are waiting in unemployment lines. Our debt is too high and our opportunities too few.
And this President wakes up every morning, looks out across America and is proud to announce, "It could be worse."
It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse?
Of course not.
What defines us as Americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better.
That conviction guides our campaign. It has rallied millions of Americans in every corner of this country to our cause.
Over the last six months, I've listened to anxious voices in town meetings and visited with students and soldiers. In break rooms and living rooms, I've heard stories of families getting by on less, of carefully planned retirements now replaced by jobs at minimum wage. But even now, amidst the worst economy since the Great Depression, I've rarely heard a refrain of hopelessness.
Americans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times. We still believe in the hope, the promise, and the dream of America. We still believe in that shining city on a hill.
We know that the future of this country is better than 8 or 9% unemployment.
It is better than $15 trillion in debt.
It is better than the misguided policies and broken promises of the last three years – and the failed leadership of one man.
The President has run out of ideas. Now, he's running out of excuses. And tonight, we are asking the good people of South Carolina to join the citizens of New Hampshire and make 2012 the year he runs out of time.
President Obama wants to put free enterprise on trial. In the last few days, we have seen some desperate Republicans join forces with him. This is such a mistake for our Party and for our nation. This country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy. We must offer an alternative vision. I stand ready to lead us down a different path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not dragged down by a resentment of success. In these difficult times, we cannot abandon the core values that define us as unique -- We are One Nation, Under God.
Make no mistake, in this campaign, I will offer the American ideals of economic freedom a clear and unapologetic defense.
Our campaign is about more than replacing a President; it is about saving the soul of America. This election is a choice between two very different destinies.
President Obama wants to "fundamentally transform" America. We want to restore America to the founding principles that made this country great.
He wants to turn America into a European-style entitlement society. We want to ensure that we remain a free and prosperous land of opportunity.
This President takes his inspiration from the capitals of Europe; we look to the cities and small towns of America.
This President puts his faith in government. We put our faith in the American people.
He is making the federal government bigger, burdensome, and bloated. I will make it simpler, smaller, and smarter.
He raised the national debt. I will cut, cap, and balance the budget.
He enacted job-killing regulations; I'll eliminate them.
He lost our AAA credit rating; I'll restore it.
He passed Obamacare; I'll repeal it.
When it comes to the economy, my highest priority as President will be worrying about your job, not saving my own.
Internationally, President Obama has adopted an appeasement strategy. He believes America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. I believe a strong America must – and will – lead the future.
He doesn't see the need for overwhelming American military superiority. I will insist on a military so powerful no one would think of challenging it.
He chastises friends like Israel; I'll stand with our friends.
He apologizes for America; I will never apologize for the greatest nation in the history of the Earth.
Our plans protect freedom and opportunity, and our blueprint is the Constitution of the United States.
The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle-to-grave assurances that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise more benefits, then I'm not your President. You have that President today.
But if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us.
If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your vote.
I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American.
I want you to remember what it was like to be hopeful and excited about the future, not to dread each new headline.
I want you to remember when you spent more time dreaming about where to send your kids to college than wondering how to make it to the next paycheck.
I want you to remember when you weren't afraid to look at your retirement savings or the price at the pump.
I want you to remember when our White House reflected the best of who we are, not the worst of what Europe has become.
That America is still out there. We still believe in that America.
We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves.
This election, let's fight for the America we love. We believe in America.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

Remarks in Columbia Following the South Carolina Primary

January 21, 2012

You should hear when we win, I tell you, it's really something. Now this race - this race is getting to be even more interesting. I just want to say to you guys thank you so very much for all your help over the last days and months and weeks going across this great state. I appreciate all the calls you made, all the people that you brought into the polls for us. This was an exciting day for us. And I just want to say thanks to all the people that have helped.
Let's begin with your governor, Governor Nikki Haley has been fabulous and I owe her so very much for her help. And treasure Curtis Loftus, who has chaired my campaign, I appreciate his help. There have been a number of state legislators, Nate Valentine has been one of those who has been with me from the very beginning, David Rad and of course the people of South Carolina, who helped this campaign, I owe you so very much. Thank you for this great night tonight.
Tonight I want to congratulate, of course, Speaker Gingrich and my fellow Republicans at a hard-fought campaign here in South Carolina. We're now three contests into a long primary season. This is a hard fight because there's so much worth fighting for. We've - we've still got a long way to go and a lot of work to do and tomorrow we're going to move on to Florida. It's a state what has suffered terribly under the failed policies of President Obama.
Now three years ago we had nothing but promises and slogans by which to judge this president. Today we have a record of deficits, decline and debt. President Obama likes to remind us that elections have consequences.
Well, today the consequences are clear and the stakes have never been higher. I've said this before and I firmly believe that this election is a battle for the soul of America.
It's -- [applause] -- it's a choice -- it's a choice between two very different destinies for America. President Obama wants to fundamentally transform our country. We want to restore to America the founding principles that made this country great and the hope of the earth. [applause]
He is -- he is making the federal government bigger and bloated. I want to make the federal government simpler, smaller and smarter and will do it. [applause]
He has raised the national debt time and time again to astronomical levels. I will cut the budget. I will cap the budget and I will finally balance the United States budget. [applause]
He has -- he has -- he has enacted job-killing regulations. I will eliminate them. He passed ObamaCare. I will repeal it. [applause]
The president -- the president has adopted an appeasement strategy. He believes that America's role as leader of the world is a thing of the past. I believe in a strong America and I believe that America must lead this nation, must lead this world and be the leader of the free world and the free world must lead the entire world. [applause]
In recent weeks, the choice within our party has also come into stark focus. President Obama has no experience running a business and no experience running a state. Our party can't be led to victory by someone who also has never run a business and never run a state. [applause]
Our president has divided the nation, engaged in class warfare and attacked the free enterprise system that has made America the economic envy of the world. We cannot defeat that president with a candidate who has joined in that very assault on free enterprise. [applause]
When my -- when my opponents attack success and free enterprise, they're not only attacking me, they're attacking every person who dreams of a better future, he's attacking you. I will support you. I will help you have a better future. I will make sure that America is a place of opportunity for all. [applause]
I'm passionate -- I'm passionate about our economic liberty because I have witnessed our free enterprise system as it rewards the hard work of many and creates prosperity for all in this great country. And over the past few weeks we have seen a frontal assault on free enterprise. We expected this from President Obama. We didn't anticipate some Republicans would join him. That's a mistake for our party and for our nation. Ours is the party of free enterprise and free markets and consumer choice. [applause]
The Republican Party doesn't demonize prosperity. We celebrate success in our party. That's a -- that's one of the big differences between our party and our president. He leads the party of big government. He believes in ever-expanding entitlement. He's wrong. We're right. And this is a battle we cannot lose. [applause]
Those who pick up the weapons of the left today will find them turned against us tomorrow. That's the choice our party gives America, or else we don't offer any choice at all and Americans in my view will demand a real choice in this campaign between those who believe in success and prosperity and opportunity, and those who believe in government. And I think they will choose us. [applause]
By the way, by the way, if President Obama think he can compare his record of job losses with my record of job creation, that a battle we're going to win. And -- [applause] -- and if he thinks he can compare his record of crony capitalism with my record of free market success, that's a battle we can win. [applause]
And let me be clear. If Republican leaders want to join this president in demonizing success and disparaging conservative values, then they're not going to be fit to be our nominee. Now, our campaign has fought very hard here in South Carolina, and in the coming weeks and months I'll keep fighting for every single vote. I will compete in every single state. [applause]
We're going to win this nomination and we're going to defeat President Obama in November. [applause]
Our campaign will be about the businesses I help start, not the bills I've tried to pass. And above all, our campaign will champion the founding principles of liberty, opportunity and economic freedom. I don't shrink from competition. I embrace it. I believe competition makes us all better. I know it's making our campaign stronger.
And in the coming weeks, the ideals of free enterprise and economic freedom will need a very strong defense, and I intend to make it. [applause]
The American people -- the American people -- [laughter]
Why, thank you. Ann agrees with you. [laughter]
The American people will be looking for a real choice in this campaign, and I will provide it. The plan we're offering protects freedom and opportunity. And our blueprint? It's the Constitution of the United States of America. [applause]
If you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you'll join us. If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not a destiny, then I'm asking for your vote.
We still believe in the America that's a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves. We still believe in that shining city on a hill.
This election I'm asking for your support. We need to you join in the fight. Thank you and God bless the United States of America. You guys are the best. Thank you so much. [applause]

Remarks in Tampa, Florida on President Obama's State of the Union Address

January 24, 2012

Thank you.  It's good to be in the Sunshine State.  It breaks my heart to visit plants like this one.
In 2008, this plant closed because of the economic downturn.  In a normal recovery under strong leadership, it could now be full of workers.
Here in Florida, people used to wake up and look forward to a hard day's work and a good, honest wage.  The money they earned helped support families and build communities.  Today too many factory floors are silent, warehouses are deserted, corporate offices are empty, and real estate endeavors are abandoned.  Floridians are struggling to find a job, keep a home, and raise a family.
As I've traveled across America, I've heard similar stories in virtually every corner of this country.  High unemployment and record home foreclosures.  Debt that's too high and opportunities that are too few.  This is the real state of our union.  But you won't hear stories like these in President Obama's address tonight.  The unemployed don't get invitations to sit with the First Lady.
Instead, tonight, the President will do what he does best.  He will give a nice speech with a lot of memorable phrases.  But he won't give you the hard numbers.
Like 9.9 — that's the unemployment rate in this state.
Or 25 percent — that's the percentage of foreclosed homes in America that are right here in Florida.
Or $15 trillion — that's the size of our national debt.
Instead, tonight, President Obama will make the opening argument in his campaign against a "Do Nothing Congress."  But, we shouldn't forget that for two years, this President had a Congress that could do everything he wanted.
With huge Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, President Obama was free to pursue any policy he pleased.
Did he fix the economy?
Did he tackle the housing crisis?
Did he get Americans back to work?
No.
He spent $787 billion on a stimulus bill and put us on track to borrow and spend $5 trillion in just his first term.
He forced through Obamacare — a trillion-dollar entitlement we don't want and can't afford.
He took over auto companies and student loans.
He stacked the National Labor Relations Board with union yes-men who, in turn, did favors for his campaign contributors and favorite friends.
When we needed stability and solvency, he gave us Solyndra.
When we needed a climate for private investment, he gave us Cash for Clunkers.
When we needed more domestic energy to keep prices low and create jobs, he imposed bans on oil drilling and turned his EPA regulators loose to slow our development of natural gas.
He's spearheaded one of the largest expansions of government in American history.  And he's paying for it with money borrowed from China.
Three years ago, we measured Candidate Obama by his hopeful promises and slogans.
Today, President Obama has amassed an actual record of debt, decline, and disappointment.
This President's agenda made these troubled times last longer.  He and his allies made it harder for the economy to recover.
Instead of solving the housing crisis and getting Americans back to work, President Obama has been building a European-style welfare state.  He has pushed for a second stimulus and deep cuts to our national defense.  He's asking the American people for another trillion dollars — and another term in office.
He keeps telling people, "We can't wait." To which I say, "Yes, we can."
Tonight, the President will deliver his State of the Union.  But make no mistake: What he's really offering are partisan planks for his re-election campaign.
The President has been telling people that his agenda will create an economy that's "built to last." 
Well, let's talk about what has lasted.
What has lasted is unemployment above 8% for 35 straight months.  What will last is almost as much debt in four years as all the prior presidents combined.  What will last are home values that are too low and foreclosure rates that are too high.  And a legacy of debt that will imperil future generations.
What is critical is that we make today Barack Obama's last State of the Union.
The President's agenda sounds less like "built to last" and more like doomed to fail.  What he's proposing is more of the same: more taxes, more spending, and more regulation.  And all of his proposals involve "big" government and "big" price tags.
Tonight, we'll also be treated to more divisive rhetoric from a desperate campaigner-in-chief.  It's shameful for a President to use the State of the Union to divide our nation.  And someone ought to tell him:  In order for the economy to truly "work for everyone," everyone needs to be working.
But more than anything, I expect the President will take this opportunity to take another victory lap.  In big speeches, he tends to tell tall tales about an America that's thriving on his watch.
In 2010, he announced that "the worst of this economic storm has passed."  I know the people of Tampa don't believe that.  Today, 24 million Americans are struggling for work.  2.8 million Americans have lost their homes.  But President Obama believes he ranks among the four best presidents in history.
Here in Florida, you know better.  You know that this President has run out of ideas.  He's run out of excuses.  And, with your help, 2012 will be the year he runs out of time.
If tonight were the first message to Congress in a Romney administration, I'd have the courage to tell the American people how it is and tell Congress what we really need to do.  I wouldn't spend my time blaming others for how we got in this mess; I'd explain how we're going to get out of it.  I'd use the State of the Union to lay out an agenda that will get our country back on track and get our fiscal house in order.
My agenda would make government simpler, smaller, and smarter.
As President, I will repeal unnecessary regulations and restore our good credit rating.
I will reduce tax rates and simplify the tax code, especially for middle-income Americans.
I will streamline regulation, ensure the prompt review of projects, and order agencies to focus on economic growth.  The Keystone Pipeline is a real "shovel-ready" project that would put 20,000 Americans back to work.  Three years of review is long enough.  The President was wrong to reject it.  I will approve it.
I will open up new markets for American goods, and open up our lands so that we can finally develop our energy resources.  A revolution in drilling for natural gas has opened up new supplies that will create American jobs, provide affordable energy, and offer our manufacturers a competitive edge.  My administration will support the development of these resources, not find excuses to stand in the way.
If I were speaking to Congress tonight, I'd note that it's now been one thousand days since the Senate last passed a budget.  That's irresponsible.  It's unacceptable.  And, as President, I will cut spending, cap spending, and finally balance the budget.
I would pledge to do all that a President can to get America working again.  When it comes to the economy, my highest priority would be worrying about your job, not saving my own.
As President, I will reverse the Obama-era defense cuts.  I believe a strong America must — and will — lead the future.  I will insist on a military so powerful that no one would ever think of challenging it.
That is the State of the Union I would deliver tonight.  My plans protect our freedom and preserve opportunity.  They reflect common-sense solutions and conservative values.  And, over the past seven months, that agenda has rallied millions of Americans to our cause.
Our campaign is about more than replacing a President; it is about saving the soul of America. This election is a choice between two very different destinies.
President Obama wants to "fundamentally transform" America. We want to restore America to the founding principles that made this country great.
This President puts his faith in government. We put our faith in the American people.
Ours is the party of free enterprise, free markets, and consumer choice.  The Republican Party stands for personal responsibility and equal opportunity.  We don't demonize prosperity.  We celebrate success.
That's the difference between our party and this President.  He leads the party of big government.  He believes in ever-expanding entitlement.
He's wrong.  We're right.  And this is a battle we cannot lose.
During my 25 years in business, I helped companies like Staples and the Sports Authority grow from start-ups to international enterprises.  I turned around companies, a state government, and an Olympics.  And I am passionate about our economic liberty because I have seen it reward the hard work of many — and create prosperity for all.
I have the experience to get America back to work.  I have the judgment we need in the White House.  And I will offer a real choice in the coming campaign.
Tonight will mark another chapter in the misguided policies of the last three years — and the failed leadership of one man.  But Americans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times.
We still believe in the hope, the promise, and the dream of America. We still believe in that shining city on a hill.
A year from now a President will be giving another State of the Union address.  The choice before us is clear.
Do we want a president who will try to explain again why his policies haven't worked?
Do we want a president who will keep promising that this time he will get it right?
Do we want a president who keep telling us why he's right and why we're wrong?
Or do we want the sense of excitement that comes with a new beginning?
We are Americans and Americans don't have to settle for a president who argues that things could be worse.  We know that things can — and must — be better.
If you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us.
If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your support.
If you share my belief that we need to scale back government so that we can expand prosperity, then I need your vote.
Thank you.  And God bless the United States of America.

Remarks in Tampa Following the Florida Primary

January 31, 2012

Thank you all. To the people of Florida tonight, thank you for this great victory. There are fewer candidates than when the race began, but the three gentlemen left are serious and able competitors. And I congratulate them on another hard-fought contest in this campaign.
Primary contests are not easy — and they're not supposed to be. As this primary unfolds, our opponents in the other party have been watching. They like to comfort themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided and weak.
But I've got some news for them: A competitive primary does not divide us; it prepares us. And when we gather here in Tampa seven months from now for our convention, ours will be a united party with a winning ticket for America!
Three years ago this week, a newly elected President Obama faced the American people and said that if he couldn't turn the economy around in three years, he'd be looking at a one-term proposition. We're here to collect.
Since then, we've had 35 months of unemployment over 8 percent. Under this President, Americans have seen more job losses and more home foreclosures than under any President in modern history.
In the last ten days, I met a father who was terrified that this would be the last night his family would sleep in the only home his son has ever known. I've met seniors who thought these would be their best years and now live day to day worried about making ends meet. I've met Hispanic entrepreneurs who thought they had achieved the American Dream and are now seeing it disappear.
In his State of the Union Address, the President actually said, "Let's remember how we got here." Don't worry, Mr. President, we remember exactly how we got here! You won the election!
Leadership is about taking responsibility, not making excuses. In another era of American crisis, Thomas Paine is reported to have said, "Lead, follow, or get out of the way." Mr. President, you were elected to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you to get out of the way!
I stand ready to lead this Party and our nation. As a man who has spent his life outside Washington, I know what it is like to start a business. I know how extraordinarily difficult it is to build something from nothing. I know how government kills jobs and, yes, how it can help.
My leadership helped build businesses from scratch. My leadership helped save the Olympics from scandal and give our athletes the chance to make us all proud. My leadership cut taxes 19 times and cast over 800 vetoes. We balanced every budget, and we kept our schools first among fifty states. My leadership will end the Obama era and begin a new era of American prosperity!
This campaign is about more than replacing a President. It is about saving the soul of America. President Obama and I have two very different visions of America.
President Obama wants to grow government and continue to amass trillion dollar deficits. I will not just slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze government's share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And, without raising taxes, I will finally balance the budget.
President Obama's view of capitalism is to send your money to his friends' companies. My vision for free enterprise is to return entrepreneurship to the genius and creativity of the American people.
On one of the most personal matters of our lives, our health care, President Obama would turn decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obamacare; I will repeal it.
Like his colleagues in the faculty lounge who think they know better, President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy. I will make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for innovators, and for job creators. And unlike the other people running for President, I know how to do that.
President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience; I will defend religious liberty and overturn regulations that trample on our first freedom.
President Obama believes America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. He is intent on shrinking our military capacity at a time when the world faces rising threats. I will insist on a military so powerful no one would ever think of challenging it.
President Obama has adopted a strategy of appeasement and apology. I will stand with our friends and speak out for those seeking freedom.
President Obama wants to "fundamentally transform" America. We want to restore America to the founding principles that made this country great.
Our plans protect freedom and opportunity, and our blueprint is the Constitution of the United States.
Together, we will build an America where "hope" is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker.
The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle-to-grave assurances that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise more benefits, then I'm not your President. You have that President today.?
But if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us.
If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your vote.
I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American.
I want you to remember what it was like to be hopeful and excited about the future, not to dread each new headline.
I want you to remember when you spent more time dreaming about where to send your kids to college than wondering how to make it to the next paycheck.
I want you to remember when you weren't afraid to look at your retirement savings or the price at the pump.
I want you to remember when our White House reflected the best of who we are, not the worst of what Europe has become.
That America is still out there. We still believe in that America.
We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves.
This election, let's fight for the America we love. We believe in America.
Thank you. And God bless America.

Remarks in Las Vegas Following the Nevada Caucuses

February 4, 2012

Thank you. Thank you, guys. Wow, what a great showing. Thank you, Nevada.
You know, this is not the first time you gave me your vote of confidence, and this time I'm going to take it to the White House. [cheers and applause]
Four years ago, candidate Obama came to Nevada, promising to help. But after he was elected, his help was telling people to skip coming here for conventions and meetings.
Today, Nevada unemployment is over 12 percent. Home values have plummeted. And Nevada's foreclosure rate is the highest in the nation. I've walked in Nevada neighborhoods blighted by abandoned homes, where people wonder why Barack Obama failed them.
Well, Mr. President, Nevada has had enough of your kind of help. [applause]
Three years ago, a newly-elected President Obama told America that if Congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent. It hasn't been below 8 percent since. This week he's been trying to take a bow for 8.3 percent unemployment. Not so fast, Mr. President. This is the 36th straight month with unemployment above the red line your own administration drew. And if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent.
Mr. President, America has also had enough of your kind of help. [applause]
CROWD [cheering]: Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.
ROMNEY: Let me ask you -- let me ask you here a question. Did Obama care encourage businesses to hire more people?
CROWD: No!
ROMNEY: Did Dodd Frank get banks to renegotiate and make more loans?
CROWD: No!
ROMNEY: Did the National Labor Relations Board attack on Boeing in South Carolina encourage employers to expand here?
CROWD: No!
ROMNEY: Did efforts to block the domestic production of energy and the Keystone pipeline speed job creation?
CROWD: No!
ROMNEY: And did those billions of dollars the president sent to his green energy buddies give anyone here a job?
CROWD: No!
ROMNEY: Mr. President, we welcome any good news on the jobs front. But it is thanks to the innovation of the American people in the private sector and not to you, Mr. President. [cheers and applause]
CROWD [cheering]: Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!
ROMNEY: This president's misguided policies made these tough times last longer. Earlier in the week, he spoke with a woman from Texas during an online event. She told him that her husband has been out of work for three years. President Obama said that he found that "interesting."
Interesting? Really? I've got a better word. Tragic. America needs a president who can fix the economy because he understands the economy, and I do, and I will. [applause]
This president began his presidency by apologizing for America. He should now be apologizing to America. We're not going to settle - we're not going to settle for a president who tells us it could be worse.
What defines us as Americans is our conviction that things must be better. That conviction guides this campaign. It's rallied millions of Americans to our cause, including tens of thousands of Nevadans, who gave me their support here today and I thank them. [applause]
Nevadans know that our future is brighter and better than these troubled times. It's better than 15 percent real unemployment. It's better than $15 trillion in debt. It's better than the misguided policies and broken promises of the last three years and the failed leadership of one man.
Our campaign is about more than just replacing the president, however. This is really a campaign about saving the soul of America. President Obama says he wants to fundamentally transform America. We want to restore to America the founding principles that made this country great. [applause]
Our vision for the future could not be more different than his. President Obama will grow government and amass more trillion dollar deficits. I will not de-slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze -- I will not just freeze government share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And without raising taxes, I will finally balance the American budget. [applause]
President Obama's brand of capitalism sends your money to his friend's companies. My vision for free enterprise is to return entrepreneurship to the genius of consumer markets and to the creativity of the American people. [applause]
Now, like his colleagues in fat lounges, they think they know better. President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy. I will instead make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for innovators and for job creators and get America working again! [applause]
And by the way, unlike the other people running for president, I know just how to do that. [applause]
If I'm elected president, my priority will be worrying about your job, not saving my own. [applause]
Now, as you know, one of the most important and personal matters of our lives is our health care. President Obama would turn the decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obama Care. I will repeal Obama Care. [applause]
The president -- just this week, President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience. I will defend religious liberty and overturn any regulation that tramples on our first freedom, our right to worship as we choose.
CROWD [cheering]: Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt.
ROMNEY: President Obama is shrinking our military and hollowing out our national defense. I will insist on a military so powerful that no one in the world would ever think of challenging us. President Obama seems to believe that America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. I believe the 21st century will be and must be an American century. [applause]
CROWD [cheering]: Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney, Romney.
ROMNEY: Our mission -- our mission is to increase the freedom and opportunity of the American people and our blueprint is the constitution of the United States. We're going to build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker. [applause]
And I will not attempt to bribe the voters with promises of new programs and new subsidies and ever increasing checks from government. If this election is a bidding war of who can promise the most benefits, then I'm not your president. You have that president today.
But if you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you'll join with us. [applause]
If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour and not our destiny, then I'm asking for your vote. I'm asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American. I want you to remember why it was you or your ancestors who sacrificed to come to America and to overcome the challenges of life in a new country, why they came here. It was not for a free ticket, it was for freedom. [applause]
It was not for the pursuit of government benefits, it was for the pursuit of happiness. We still believe in that America. We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be bigger and better than ourselves. This election, we must fight for the America we love. We believe in America.
Thank you so much and God bless you all.

Remarks in Denver, Colorado Following the Minnesota and Colorado Caucuses and the Missouri Primary

February 7, 2012

Thank you, Colorado! I congratulate my fellow Republicans, and I look forward to the contests to come.
We will take our message of liberty and prosperity to every corner of the country. And when this primary season is over, we will stand united to defeat Barack Obama and restore the values that have made America the greatest nation on earth.
Three years ago, Barack Obama came to Colorado to accept his Party's nomination. He rented out a huge stadium. He hauled in some Styrofoam Greek columns and two giant screens to set the mood. On that big stage in Denver, he made some even bigger promises.
He said the “Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress.”
Under his definition, progress would be measured by "how many people can find a job that pays a mortgage."
More Americans have lost their jobs during President Obama's term than during any other in modern history. And more Americans have lost their homes during President Obama's term than during any other in modern history. Under his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed!
In that same speech in Denver, candidate Obama said progress would be determined by “whether the average American family saw its income go up ... instead of down." During the last four years, the median income has fallen by around 10%. Under his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed!
Candidate Obama went on to say that we could measure progress by "whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business.” Have you seen what's happened to small business? Last year, under President Obama, there were almost 100,000 fewer new business start-ups than there were three years before. By his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed!
Candidate Obama said we could see progress in “an economy that honors the dignity of work.” Under President Obama, the average duration of unemployment has more than doubled and 14 million more people are on food stamps. By his own definition, President Obama has failed. We will succeed!
This week, President Obama said that he deserves a second term because, and I quote, “We've made progress.” No, Mr. President, under the definition of progress you described here four years ago, you have not made progress.
Three years ago, President Obama said that if he couldn't turn the economy around in three years, he'd be looking at a one-term proposition. Truer words could not have been spoken.
This is a moment when our country cries out for fundamental change and reform. Washington cannot reform itself and Washington will never be reformed by those who have been compromised by the culture of Washington.
This is a clear choice. I am the only person in this race — Republican or Democrat — who has never served a day in Washington. In the world I come from, leadership is starting a business, not trying to get a bill out of a subcommittee.
I have said over and over that this campaign is about more than just replacing a President — it's about saving the soul of America. We all know in our hearts that soul is corrupted by a Washington culture of reckless spending, voting to raise your own pay, and saying you support term limits but always running for re-election. It's that Washington that we must change.
This is not a moment when we can continue to do business as usual. This is not a moment when we can expect those in Washington to realize suddenly that they have been wrong and next time they will get it right.
I stand before you ready to lead this party and this nation. I have led businesses. I have led an Olympics. I have led a state.
President Obama says he is learning. We say, he is learning too little and too late. The presidency is not the place to learn how to lead. It is a place to exercise the judgment and leadership that has been learned over a lifetime.
I know that many of us are concerned about our future. Over the last thirty years, I can't tell you how many times I've heard a situation is hopeless or a long list of all the reasons something can't be done. But I've never been very good at listening to those people and I've always enjoyed proving them wrong.
It's one of the lessons I learned from dad.
My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed, as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On his honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels.
There were a lot reasons my father could have given up or set his sights lower. But Dad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint.
For my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where the circumstances of birth are no barrier to achieving ones dreams. In Dad's America, small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged, and respected.
The spirit of enterprise, innovation, pioneering and derring-do propelled our standard of living and economy past every other nation on earth.
I refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. We stand for freedom and opportunity and hope.
These last few years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a few years, we have not lost our way. The principles that made us a great nation and leader of the world have notlost their meaning. They never will.
We know we can bring this country back.
I believe in America. And so do you.
This election, let's fight for the America we love. We believe in America.
Thank you. And God bless America.

Remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference

February 10, 2012

This year, here at CPAC, we've got a great crowd. It's been a great conference. For that I suppose we should acknowledge President Obama, the conservative movement's top recruiter. Turns out, he really is a great community organizer. Although, I don't think we were the community he had in mind.
Today we are poised for a great victory in November. The pundits and the pollsters tell us we can win this election. But we must tell the nation why we should win. It is up to us to prove that we are truly ready to step forward and lead this country. This election is not just about getting more votes. Defeating Barack Obama is only one step toward our greater goal of saving America.
Of course we can defeat Barack Obama! That's the easy part! Believe me, November 6th will be the easiest day our next President will face.
This country we love is in jeopardy. It's more than the economic statistics we read, it's the pain we feel in our hearts. For three years we have suffered through the failures not only of a weak leader, but of a bankrupt ideology. I am convinced that if we do our job, if we lead with conviction and integrity, that history will record the Obama Presidency as the last gasp of liberalism's great failure and a turning point for a new conservative era.
But it's not enough to show how they have failed. We must prove we deserve to lead. I am here today to ask you to stand with me shoulder to shoulder as we go forward to fight for America.
As we step forward together, now is the time to reaffirm what it means to be a conservative and why this must be our greatest hour. America is like no other country in history. At the very heart of our American conservatism is the conviction that the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are uniquely powerful, foundational, and defining. Some see the hand of Providence in their authorship. Others credit the brilliance of the Founders. Many of us see both. But conservatives all agree that departing from these founding principles is a departure from the greatness of America-- from our mission, from our freedom, from our prosperity, and from our purpose.
I know this President will never get it, but we conservatives aren't just proud to cling to our guns and to our religion. We are also proud to cling to our Constitution!
The wisdom of our founding documents is that they see the nation's prosperity not as a product of government, but as the product of individual citizens, each pursuing happiness. This is key to the success of the American experiment. America does not just exist for the people, it has been made exceptional by the people.
A free people, pursuing their own dreams and achieving success in their own ways — that is what has propelled America and made us the most prosperous and powerful nation in the world. Many politicians on both sides of the aisle have forgotten that — if they ever really understood it at all. They have fallen under the spell of Washington.
Politicians are routinely elected on promises to change Washington, but when they come here, they become creatures of Washington. They begin to see government as the answer to every challenge and the solution for every problem. At every turn, they try to substitute the heavy hand of the federal government for free citizens and free enterprise. They think government knows better — and can do better — than a free people exercising their free will. And this President is the worst offender. Barack Obama is the poster child for the arrogance of government.
This election really is a battle for the soul of America. And it's going to come down to a choice between whether we want to be a nation of and by Washington ... or a nation of and by a free people.
As conservatives, we are united by a set of core commitments. But not everyone has taken the same path to get here. There are college students at this conference who are reading Burke and Hayek. When I was your age, you could have told me they were infielders for the Detroit Tigers. Some of you work in think tanks or follow the writings of prominent leaders. Some of you have worked in government or labored on the front lines of conservative causes. I salute you all.
My path to conservatism came from my family, my faith, and my life's work.
I was raised in a home shaped by and rooted in conservative values. My mother's father — my grandfather — came to America from England. As a teenager, he was alone in a new country, but he risked it all for a chance at religious liberty and economic opportunity.
You've probably heard how proud I am of my father. He was born to American parents living in Mexico. When he was five, they moved back to the United States. His dad was a builder who went bust more than once. My Dad grew up poor and never had a chance to finish his college degree. But he believed in a country where the circumstances of one's birth were not a barrier to achievement. And with hard work, he became the head of a car company and the Governor of the great state of Michigan.
The values that allowed my parents to achieve their dreams are the same values they instilled in my siblings and me. Those aren't values I just talk about; they are values that I live every day. My 42-year marriage to my wife, Ann; the life we've built with our five sons; and the faith that sustains us — these conservative constants have shaped my life.
In business, if you're not fiscally conservative, you're bankrupt. I spent 25 years balancing budgets, eliminating waste, and keeping as far away from government as was humanly possible. I did things conservatism is designed for — I started new businesses and turned around broken ones. And I am not ashamed to say that I was very successful at it.
I know conservatism because I have lived conservatism.
As governor of Massachusetts, I had the unique experience of defending our conservative principles in the most liberal state in our union.
When I took office, I was facing a $3 billion budget deficit and an economy in a tailspin.
Even with a legislature that was 85% Democrat, I cut taxes 19 times and balanced the budget all four years. I cast over 800 vetoes and cut entire programs. I erased a $3 billion budget shortfall and left office with a $2 billion rainy day fund. If there was a program, an agency, or a department that needed cutting, we cut it. In fact, a commentator once said that I didn't just go after the sacred cows, I went after the whole herd. And I can't wait to get my hands on Washington.
During my tenure, our conservative values also came under attack. Less than a year after I took office, the state's supreme court inexplicably found a right to same-sex marriage in our constitution. I pushed for a stay of the decision, fought for a marriage amendment to our constitution, and successfully prohibited out-of-state couples from coming to our state to get married and then go home. On my watch, we fought hard and prevented Massachusetts from becoming the Las Vegas of gay marriage. When I am President, I will preserve the Defense of Marriage Act and I will fight for a federal amendment defining marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman.
During my time in office, I stood up to those who wanted to call into question the very definition of life. I vetoed a bill that would have opened the door to cloning and embryo farming. I vetoed a bill that would have allowed young girls to gain access to abortion-inducing drugs. I fought for abstinence education in our public schools. And I defended the Catholic Church's right to serve their community in ways that were consistent with their conscience through adoption programs that placed children in a home with a mom and a dad.
I was a conservative governor. I fought against long odds in a deep blue state. I understand the battles that we, as conservatives, must fight because I have been on the front lines.
Here at CPAC, I know you understand this. This gathering has always welcomed me. And you have consistently supported me — not because of my rhetoric, but because of my record.
Over the course of this conference, several candidates either have been — or will come — before you seeking to lead our country out of these troubled times. What distinguishes us from one another is not our opposition to President Obama or even our support for conservative convictions. What distinguishes us is the nature of our experience, our perspective, and our judgment.
This election will ultimately be about two very different visions for America. But our more immediate choice will be between candidates from two very different backgrounds.
I spent 25 years in business, starting at the bottom and going on to help create a great American success story. I led an Olympics out of the shadows of scandal and turned around a state crying out for leadership.
In each of these endeavors, I worked with many talented people, but I was the Chief Executive. Success or failure lay on my shoulders. When tough decisions had to be made, I made them.
Leadership as a Chief Executive isn't about getting a bill out of subcommittee or giving a speech — it's about setting clear goals and overcoming constant adversity. It's about sharing credit when times are good and taking responsibility for failure.
I am the only candidate in this race, Republican or Democrat, who has never worked a day in Washington. I don't have old scores to settle or decades of cloakroom deals to defend.
As conservatives, you've learned to be skeptical of this city and its politicians and right you are.
My wife and I raised five boys and one of the lessons you learn is that when you hear an excuse that just doesn't make sense... it's because it doesn't make sense. And let me tell you, any politician who tries to convince you that they hated Washington so much that they just couldn't leave, well, that's the same politician who will try to sell you a Bridge to Nowhere.
This is a moment when our country needs serious change and real reform. So, let me tell you exactly what kind of President I will be.
To get America back on track and get Americans back to work, we need bold and sweeping reforms. These are not managerial issues of changing this department or that agency. To change Washington, we must change the relationship between government and citizen. These are moral choices that will define us for generations to come.
Today we borrow almost forty cents of every dollar we spend. That is unconscionable. It's unsustainable. It's reckless. It's immoral. And, if I am President, it will end.
I will approach every spending decision by asking a few important questions: Can we afford it? And, if not, is it worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?
As President, I will not just slow the growth of government, I will cut it. I will not just freeze government's share of the total economy, I will reduce it. And, without raising taxes or sacrificing America's military superiority, I will finally balance the budget.
And that will start with the easiest cut of all — I will eliminate Obamacare.
I will dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce. And, for the first time ever, we will tie the compensation and benefits of federal workers to those in the private sector. The principle here is simple: public servants should not get a better deal than the citizens they serve.
But cutting spending and bureaucracy alone won't be enough. In their current form, Social Security and Medicare are unsustainable. And we cannot afford to avoid our entitlement challenges any longer.
I am the only candidate for President who has offered a sweeping, specific plan to save Social Security and reform Medicare. There are those who say you can't talk straight to the American people on these key issues and still win an election. I say we can, we must, and I will!
These are sensible and critical reforms. Under my plan, no one at or near the retirement age will see any changes. And tax hikes are off the table.
We will slowly and gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security — and, we will slow the growth in benefits for our nation's higher-income retirees.
When it comes to Medicare, tomorrow's seniors should have the freedom to choose between traditional Medicare and a range of private plans. If these future seniors choose a more expensive plan, they would bear the additional cost.
I know this President and his liberal allies will attack me for leading where he has failed. So be it. I will stand and fight — and we will win.
He will attack us with the usual fear tactics, but we will remind Americans that during this President's term we have seen record high job losses and record home foreclosures. We will not be lectured to on values by the man whose ineptitude and failure has created so much unnecessary pain for our fellow Americans.
Ours will not be the easy course. But it will be the right course. And I am confident that Americans are yearning for a President to do what is needed, not what is expedient.
And let me be clear: Mine will be a pro-life presidency.
On day one, I will reinstate the Mexico City policy.
I will cut off funding for the United Nations Population Fund, which supports China's barbaric One Child Policy.
I will ensure that organizations like Planned Parenthood get no federal support.
And I will reverse every single Obama regulation that attacks our religious liberty and threatens innocent life.
The Presidency is more than a public office; it is a sacred trust. As President, I will honor that trust by assuring that America remains the greatest military power on the face of the earth. This is very simple: If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your President. You have that President today.
This election is a defining moment for our generation and for the conservative movement. Make no mistake — we have an opportunity for Greatness but with that opportunity comes defining responsibility. We cannot use this election to refight past battles or reward our friends. I know that the fundamental change this moment demands will take fresh, bold conservative leadership with real world solutions based on real world experience.
I will come to Washington, and, with your help and guidance and prayers, I will change Washington. And then I will leave Washington and go back to the life and family I love.
I believe this is a moment that demands we return to our basic values and first principals. This is our moment. This is why we are conservatives. The task before us now is to reaffirm the convictions that unite us and go forward shoulder to shoulder to secure the victory America deserves.
Thank you and God bless.

Remarks to the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Michigan

February 24, 2012

Thank you, David, for that kind introduction. I appreciate that warm welcome.
I want to thank Beth and her team at the Detroit Economic Club for hosting us. And I want to thank Ford Field for making room for us.
It's good to be back home in Michigan. I was born in Harper Hospital, and I grew up here. I can remember my first day at the Hampton School. There were about thirty kids in our kindergarten class. And I imagine that as they dropped us off at the Hampton School each morning, our parents were confident that our future would be brighter and even better than their own. Our parents believed in America's promise. They believed that if you built a good home and taught your kids the right values, if you made sure your kids got an education and were willing to work hard, that your child's future would be prosperous and secure.
In those days, we all believed that the future was full of possibility and prosperity. We felt the joyful optimism that comes from being raised in a land of opportunity, a place where — with risk and hard work — anyone can make a better life.
That deep confidence in a better tomorrow is the basic promise of America. Today, that promise is being threatened by a faltering economy and a lack of presidential leadership.
For 36 months, the unemployment rate has been over 8 percent. 24 million of our fellow Americans are struggling to find work. There are 3 million "missing workers" who have given up on finding a job altogether. Home values gone down, foreclosures are at a record high. Our debt is too great, and our opportunities too few.
Everywhere I go in this campaign, I meet Americans who are really suffering in the Obama Economy. You can see it on their faces and hear it in their voices — they are anxious and scared about the future. I've met moms and dads who are struggling to get by. One works the day shift while the other works at night just so they can make ends meet. I've met kids who are about to graduate college; they're facing student loans and a bad economy, and they are worried that they won't be able to get a job. Everywhere I go, I hear stories that serve as sad reminders of this failed presidency.
President Obama promised he would fix three things.
First, he said he would hold unemployment under 8%; it hasn't been under 8% for 36 months.
Then, he said he was going to cut the deficit in half; he's doubled it.
Third, he said he'd make Medicare and Social Security solvent for future generations. Three years later, he still hasn't offered a serious proposal for either one.
We have not seen a failure to communicate. We have seen a failure to lead.
That's why I'm running for President. I want to restore America's promise. That means more jobs, less debt, smaller government.
In the coming campaign, I am offering more than just a change in policy. I am offering a dramatic change in perspective and philosophy.
Earlier this week, I put forward pro-growth tax reforms that will get our economy moving again. Today, this administration is focused on extending unemployment benefits. But what workers in Michigan and around the country really want is a good job and rising wages. Reforming the tax code is one of the surest and quickest ways to achieve that goal.
First, I will make an across-the-board, 20% reduction in marginal individual income tax rates. By reducing the tax on the next dollar of income earned by all taxpayers, we will encourage hard work, risk-taking, and productivity by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn.
The businesses that pay taxes through the individual income tax system account for more than half of all private sector jobs in the United States. So this tax cut will encourage businesses to hire, raise wages, and grow the economy.
Second, I will make our business taxation globally competitive. I will reduce the corporate tax rate to 25%. Currently, it's among the highest in the developed world; I will bring it in line with other nations.
I will make the R&D tax credit permanent so we can encourage the kind of innovation that drives economic growth. And I will end the job-killing repatriation tax, so American companies who do business overseas will bring their profits here and invest at home.
Third, I will promote savings and investment by maintaining the 15% rate on capital gains and dividends. I will eliminate the tax entirely for those with annual income below $200,000. These low tax rates will encourage Americans to save and invest — and they will encourage business investment and economic growth.
Finally, I will repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, and I will abolish the death tax.
These changes will not add to the deficit. Stronger economic growth, spending cuts, and base broadening will offset the reductions. Middle-income Americans will continue to enjoy tax benefits that favor important priorities, including home ownership, charitable giving, health care, and savings. But there will be some changes in the current deductions and exemptions for higher-income Americans. Those who receive the greatest benefit from rate cuts will see the most significant limits.
These reforms will grow our economy, increase wages, and create jobs.
If we're going to get our fiscal house in order, however, we must also fix our nation's balance sheet. Today, we face $62 trillion in unfunded promises in our entitlement programs. We talk a lot about our $15 trillion of debt. And we've got to tackle that debt. But it's that $62 trillion in unfunded promises that keeps most of us up at night.
A few commonsense reforms will ensure we make good on our promises to today's seniors while saving Social Security and Medicare for future generations. Tax hikes are off the table, and there will be no change for those at or near retirement. But younger generations will enter a system strengthened for the 21st century.
When it comes to Social Security, we will slowly raise the retirement age. We will slow the growth in benefits for higher-income retirees.
When it comes to Medicare, tomorrow's seniors will have a choice among insurance providers, including traditional Medicare. As with Medicare Part D today, the private sector will compete to offer insurance coverage at the lowest possible price. Seniors will then receive government support to ensure they can afford that coverage. And with Medicare, like with Social Security, lower-income seniors will receive the most generous benefits.
Starting in 2022, new retirees will participate in this new system. We will gradually increase the Medicare eligibility age by one month each year. In the long run, the eligibility ages for both programs will be indexed to longevity so that they increase only as fast as life expectancy.
With these commonsense changes, we will have fixed our balance sheet. Instead of $62 trillion in unfunded commitments hanging over America's future, we'll have a balance sheet that is actually in balance.
My administration will also make the hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts necessary to reduce spending to 20% of GDP by the end of my first term. I will cap it there. And then, without sacrificing our military superiority, I will balance the budget.
There are three ways I'll get this done. First, I'll cut programs. I will look at every government program and ask this question: Is this so critical that it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?
Of course, we'll start with the easiest cut of all: Obamacare, a trillion-dollar entitlement we don't want and can't afford. It's bad medicine, bad policy, and when I'm President, the bad news of Obamacare will be over.
We'll also cut things like subsidies to Amtrak and funding for Planned Parenthood. We'll repeal the union giveaway called the Davis-Bacon Act to save taxpayers over $10 billion per year.
Second, we will return federal programs to the states. I will send Medicaid back to the states and cap that program's rate of growth. And I will do the same for other programs, like food stamps, housing subsidies, and job training.
States are better equipped to perform all these functions. Once the economy is really growing again, I believe that we should return spending on these programs to pre-recession levels, cap their rate of growth, and give the states flexibility and control. Taxpayers would save money, and those in need would benefit from programs that are more effective, efficient, and responsive.
Welfare reform showed us how well a state-led approach can work. Let's extend that conservative, small-government philosophy across the entire social safety net.
Finally, government itself must be made more efficient. I will shrink the size of the federal workforce by 10% and link the pay and benefits of federal employees to those of their peers in the private sector. Public servants should not make more than the Americans who pay their salaries.
This is a plan to get America back on track. And to get Michigan on track we also need to see a strong and vibrant auto industry.
Let's learn from the lessons of the past. In my view, the industry got in trouble because the UAW asked for too much, management gave too much, and the government CAFE standards hurt domestic automakers. The result was a cost-penalty per vehicle of about $2,000. Even the best designers and engineers could not overcome that kind of cost disadvantage.
As we look forward, the UAW must not imperil the future of the industry. CAFE standards must not be overly burdensome. The companies must invest in new technology and new markets. We should get government out of General Motors so that its future is determined by the demands of the marketplace, not the preferences of bureaucrats.
And Detroit should not just be the Motor City of America. It must be the Motor City of the world.
My economic plans will strengthen America — and strengthen Michigan.
By making bold cuts in spending and commonsense entitlement reforms, we will make our government simpler, smaller, and smarter. Through pro-growth policies, we will get our economy back on track — and get our citizens back to work. Taken together, the plan I'm offering represents the biggest fundamental change to the federal government in modern history.
These are conservative, pro-growth policies that will not only jumpstart our economy, but will stop the dangerous slide toward a society that values entitlement over opportunity. We will restore the promise of America. More jobs, less debt, smaller government.
Now, I know that President Obama will criticize my proposal. So be it. I believe the American people are ready for real leadership. I believe they deserve a bold, conservative plan for reform and economic growth. Unlike President Obama, I actually have one — and I'm not afraid to put it on the table.
My plan for America requires real leadership — and it calls for sacrifice. It does not require a leader to promise bigger and bigger benefits and something for nothing. It requires a leader to call for sacrifice. And if I'm elected President, I promise you this: Together, we will restore America's promise. Here in Michigan, the future will once again be full of promise and prosperity. Parents won't have to wonder if their children will have a better life. They'll know they will.
Together, we will get our debt under control. We will pursue spending cuts that rein in the deficit, entitlement reforms that tackle our long-term debt, and a pro-growth tax policy that will create jobs, encourage private investment, and foster risk-taking and innovation.
If we pursue the policies I've just described, you're going to see a Michigan with rising home values. Your kids will come out of college and find jobs that are consistent with their skills. Businesses will come here because of your unparalleled workforce. And Michigan will once again be known as an engine of innovation.
I'm not promising that every day will be easy. But I am promising that every day things will get better. Together, we will make America strong again. But to do that, I need your help. Next Tuesday, I need your vote.
If you want to make this election about restoring America's greatness, then I hope you will join me.
If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I am asking for your vote.
Together, let's put America on the path toward more jobs, less debt, and smaller government.
Let's restore America's promise and create a new age of prosperity for the country that we love.
Thank you. God Bless America.

Remarks in Novi, Michigan Following the Michigan and Arizona Primaries

February 28, 2012

[as prepared for delivery]
Thank you, Michigan. And thank you, Arizona!
A week ago the pundits and the pollsters were ready to count us out. But across Michigan and Arizona I kept meeting moms and dads, students and grandparents, all concerned about what was happening to this great country. I was confident that we would come together today and take a giant step toward a brighter future. Tonight, their efforts have brought our cause a great victory.
Tonight is all the more special because we're celebrating in the state where I was born, surrounded by Michiganders we consider family. Ann and I want to thank all of you who knocked on doors, made calls, and went to the polls.
And in Arizona, we want to thank Governor Brewer and Senator McCain who are celebrating with our two sons, Craig and Matt.
Our campaign is about restoring the promise of America. Last week, I unveiled a bold economic plan that will jumpstart this economy and help get Michiganders and Americans back to work.
Americans are crying out for more jobs, less debt, and smaller government – and I will deliver.
You know, a lot of people say that if you're running for office, you can't speak honestly with the American people. Well, I did – and I will – because this is a decisive moment that requires real leadership.
Times are tough. And we need leaders who will live with integrity, who have the courage to tell the truth, and who have the experience to get our economy back on track. That's the kind of leader I am. And that's the kind of president I will be.
Our campaign is about more than replacing a president. It's about restoring America's promise.
From generation to generation, Americans have always known that the future would be brighter and better. Americans have always believed in a tomorrow full of possibility and prosperity.
That's what it means to be a land of opportunity. In America, if you work hard, you can build a better life. If you teach your kids the right values and help them make the right choices, you know their future will be prosperous and secure.
That deep confidence in a better tomorrow is the basic promise of America. Today, that promise is being threatened by a faltering economy and a failed presidency.
Four years ago, we warned that the presidency was no place for on-the-job training. Today, we have an economy to prove it.
This president likes to remind us that he inherited an economic crisis. But he never mentions that he also inherited a Democratic Congress. With majorities in the House and Senate, President Obama was free to pursue any policy he pleased.
Did he fix the economy? Did he tackle the housing crisis? Did he get Americans back to work? No. He put us on a path toward debt, deficits, and decline. It is time to get off that path and get back on the path to prosperity.
These days, when he's not spending our money or infringing upon our rights, President Obama is busy running for re-election. He believes he ranks among the top four presidents in history.
He thinks he deserves a second term. He keeps saying, "We can't wait." To which I say, "Yes, we can."
Today, we're $15 trillion in debt. Real unemployment stands at 15%.
You've heard the saying, "I need a vacation from this vacation?" Well, we need to recover from this so-called "recovery."
Americans survived a Great Depression. We weathered two world wars. We've made it through tough times before. And we have not come all this way to give up now.
We still believe in the hope, the dream, and the promise of America. We know our future is better and brighter than these troubled times.
That unwavering conviction guides our campaign. It has rallied millions of Americans to our cause. And it's the message we will take to every corner of this country – from Ohio and Idaho to Georgia and Tennessee.
We've seen enough of this president over the last three years to know that we don't need another four. President Obama believes he is unchecked by our Constitution. He is unresponsive to the will of our people. In a second term, he would be unrestrained by the demands of re-election. If there is one thing we cannot afford, it is four years of Barack Obama with nothing to answer to.
His budget foreshadows what lies ahead. Runaway spending and record debt were just the warm-up act. For an encore, he wants to raise taxes on job creators and small businesses and families. We will not let him!
In this campaign, I am offering a real choice and a new direction. I have a plan that will restore America's promise through more jobs, less debt, and smaller government.
President Obama is making the federal government bigger, burdensome, and bloated. I will make it simpler, smaller, and smarter.
He raised the national debt. I will cut, cap, and balance the budget.
He passed Obamacare. I'll repeal it.
He lost our AAA credit rating; I'll restore it.
He rejected the Keystone Pipeline. I'll approve it. I will open up our lands for development, so we can finally get the energy we need at a price we can afford.
When it comes to the economy, my highest priority will be worrying about your job, not saving my own.
President Obama wants to raise your taxes. I will cut them. That starts with an across-the-board, 20% rate cut for every American. I will repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax and abolish the death tax.
He's proposed tax increases on small businesses and job creators. I will lower the corporate tax rate to 25%. I will make the R&D tax credit permanent to foster innovation. And I will end the repatriation tax to return investment to our shores. Let's finally have a tax plan that puts people to work.
President Obama's budget raises taxes on savings and investment. I will help America's middle class families save and invest tax-free.
President Obama has yet to offer a single serious proposal for saving Medicare or Social Security. I have a plan to save both – and, unlike him, I have the courage to put my plan on the table.
My plans will help create jobs and raise wages. They will strengthen entitlement programs for future generations. And they will not add to our deficit – they will abolish it.
I have a plan to get our citizens back to work – and I have the experience to get our economy back on track. I spent 25 years in business. I have been the steward of an Olympics and the leader of a state. I've cut taxes 19 times. I've turned a budget shortfall into a windfall. I know how government kills jobs – and, yes, how it can help. And I stand ready to lead our party to victory – and our nation to prosperity.
This is our time for choosing – and this is a choice we must get right. I have said it before – and I firmly believe – that this campaign is about saving the soul of America.
This election will come down to two very different visions for our future.
It's a choice between becoming a nation of and by Washington … and remaining a nation of and by a free people.
A choice between an entitlement society … and a land of opportunity.
A choice between squandering America's promise … and restoring that promise for future generations.
If you want to make this election about restoring American greatness, then I hope you will join us.
If you believe the disappointments of the last few years are a detour, not our destiny, then I need your support.
I'm asking you to get out and vote. I'm asking you to go to mittromney.com and pledge your support. I'm asking you to join in the fight for our freedom – and ensure that tomorrow will be better than today.
This election, let's restore America's promise. Let's fight for the country we love.
Thank you. And God bless America.

ROMNEY: Now, it's been -- it's been a long -- it's been a long road getting to Super Tuesday, let me -- let me be honest. And -- and my opponents have worked very hard. I want to congratulate Newt Gingrich on a good night in Georgia, and Rick Santorum on his good night, and -- and Ron Paul for his steadfast commitment to our Constitution and his strong support almost everywhere you go. He's got good followers. Thanks, you guys. Nice races. [applause]
Now, we -- we officially started our campaign about nine months ago, not very far from here at a farmhouse in New Hampshire. It was a beautiful spring day full of hope and promise, a day that made us all recognize once again how lucky we are to be Americans. What we launched that day was an effort not just to win more votes or more delegates -- delegates. It was the start of an effort to restore the promise of America, a promise that we know has been frayed by these difficult times. [applause]
We sounded our clarion call across the country, from airport, tarmacs, to factory floors, to door-to-door, heart-to-heart, face-to- face across the country. I met with moms and dads and teachers and students and factory workers and business owners. I've listened, and I've learned. I hope I'm a better candidate, by the way, for having done all that. And I... [applause]
I'm going to forever be grateful to you for the help that you've given me and -- and grateful also to all those people who helped me through this process and -- and taught me along the way.
I met some extraordinary folks. I met someone named Norm Burn, who, for me, exemplifies the innovative spirit that really built the country. Norm didn't go to college, didn't get an engineering degree, but he does have 100 patents in his name. And he turned a small shop in his basement into a very successful company that employs a lot of people. It's -- it's entrepreneurs like -- like Norm Burn who are going to get America's economy back on track if we can get the government out of the way. [applause]
I've -- I've met parents like -- like David McArthur -- maybe you saw him on "The Huckabee Show" -- whose children, in his case, have served their country in war. David's son was seriously injured in Afghanistan, as he described. He -- he only returned from the front lines to face a new fight, to get the medical care he needed and he surely has earned. And as I told David, I believe that to those who put everything on the line for us, we owe everything to them that they need. [applause]
You know, America's -- America's veterans, they deserve a lot better than long lines and reduced benefits. And as president, I'm going to make sure they get the care they deserve. [applause]
So -- so, in running for -- for office, I've had the chance of meeting people like Norm and David, and their stories are, of course, inspiring. But I've also met some people who are -- who are hurting under this stagnant Obama economy. And their stories are heartbreaking.
Some people have lost their jobs. Others are working two jobs just to make ends meet. Some used to be middle income, and now they're struggling again, right back where they started. As you know, the prices for gasoline and food and clothing and health care keep going up, but their paychecks stay the same, if they're lucky.
President Obama keeps telling these Americans that the recovery's here. But for them, the recession is not over. That's for sure. [booing]
You know, from -- from generation to generation in this country, Americans have always known that the future would be brighter and better. We've always believed in a tomorrow full of possibility and prosperity and security, that -- that deep confidence in a better tomorrow is the basic promise of America. But today that promise is being threatened by a faltering economy and a failed presidency.
To the millions of Americans who look around and can only see jobs they can't get and bills that they -- that they can't pay, I have a message: You have not failed. You have a president that's failed you, and that's going to change. [applause]
President Obama...
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
ROMNEY: You know, when he was campaigning, President Obama said he'd create jobs, but for 36 straight months, unemployment has been above 8 percent, and he's also said he'd cut the deficit in half, and he's doubled it. I mean, as you know, the debts today are too high, the opportunities are too few, and we've seen enough of this president over the last three years to know that we don't need another five of this president. That's for sure. [applause]
Look...
AUDIENCE: We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt!
ROMNEY: This -- this -- this president's run out of ideas. He's run out of excuses. And in 2012, we're going to get him out of the out -- out of the White House. [applause]
Now, President Obama seems to believe he's unchecked by the Constitution. He's unresponsive to the will of our people. He operates by command instead of by consensus. In a second term, he'd be unrestrained by the demands of re-election. And if there's one thing we cannot afford is four years of Barack Obama with no one to answer to.
So these days, you hear the president and his team, they keep telling us that things are getting better, but 24 million Americans are still struggling for work. They're high-fiving each other in the West Wing, but, my friends, the truth is, 8 percent unemployment is not the best America can do. It's just the best that this administration can do. [applause]
Look, when I'm -- when I'm president, this America -- American economy will not be lagging behind. This American economy will be leading the world as it has and as it should and as it will do in the future. [applause]
For this...
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
ROMNEY: You know, for this administration, the unemployment number is just another inconvenient statistic standing in the way of a second term, but those numbers are more than data on a spreadsheet. They're worried families and anxious faces. And tonight, I'd like to say to each of them: You are not forgotten. We will not leave you behind. Our campaign is on the move, and real change is finally on the way. [applause] [applause]
AUDIENCE: We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt! We need Mitt!
ROMNEY: These -- these times may be tough, but our citizens still believe in the promise of America, and they deserve a president who believes in them. That's why our campaign is about more than just replacing a president. It's about restoring America's promise, and we will do it. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go!
ROMNEY: We won't settle. We won't settle for this president's new normal. I'm offering a real choice and a new beginning. I have a plan that'll deliver more jobs, less debt, and smaller government. President Obama raised the national debt. I will cut, cap and balance the budget, finally. [applause]
He passed Obamacare; I will repeal Obamacare. [applause]
He lost our AAA credit rating; I will restore our AAA credit rating. [applause]
Amazingly, he rejected the Keystone pipeline. I will approve it. [applause]
You know, he has -- he has stalled domestic energy production. I'm going to open up our lands for development so we can finally get the energy we need at a price we can afford. [applause]
Look, when it comes to the economy...
AUDIENCE: Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go! Go, Mitt, go!
ROMNEY: When it comes to this economy, my highest priority will be worrying about your job, not worrying about saving my job. [applause]
I've -- and, by the way, I've got a pro-growth tax plan, jobs plan that's going to jump-start the economy. President Obama wants to raise your taxes; I'm going to cut them. That starts with an across- the-board 20 percent rate cut for every American. [applause]
And, by the way, I'm also going to repeal the alternative minimum tax, and I will finally abolish the death tax. [applause]
The -- the president has proposed raising taxes for job-creators; I will cut taxes for job-creators. [applause]
The president wants to raise taxes on savings and investment. I will help middle-class families save and invest tax-free. [applause]
You know, it's interesting. After three years, this president does not have a single serious proposal for saving Medicare or Social Security. I have a plan that saves both of them, and I have the courage to put that plan on the table, and we'll win with the truth. [applause]
As president, I will get our economy back on track and get our citizens back to work. And unlike President Obama, I actually have the experience to deliver on that promise. [applause]
As you know, I spent 25 years in business. I've been the steward of an Olympics and the leader of this great state that we're all in tonight. I cut taxes 19 times here. I turned a budget shortfall into a surplus. I know how government kills jobs, and, yes, I know how it can help create jobs. I stand ready to lead our party, and I stand ready to lead our nation to prosperity. [applause]
AUDIENCE: All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way! All the way!
ROMNEY: I've -- I've said this before, and I've said it -- I'm going to say it again. This campaign is -- is not just about a name on a ballot. It's about saving the soul of America. And it's driven by an unshakable optimism that lies within the heart of every American citizen. We know that our future's brighter and better than these troubled times. We've been knocked down, we've been tested, but we don't accept that an America like this nation has limits. We know America is a land of opportunity. We still get up every morning and thank God that we're Americans. And we know... [applause]
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
ROMNEY: We also know that, with hard work and with strong leadership, with a president that will tell the truth, with -- with a president that will live with integrity, that our greatest days as a nation are ahead of us, thanks to the American people. And tonight, we've taken one more step towards restoring the promise of tomorrow.
Tomorrow, we wake up and we start again. And the next day, we'll do the same. And so we'll go, day by day, step by step, door by door, heart to heart. There will be good days; there will be bad days. Always long hours, never enough time to get everything done.
But on November 6th, we're going to stand united, not only having won an election, but having saved a future. [applause]
It's time -- it's time -- it's time to believe in ourselves. It's time to believe in ourselves. It's time to believe in America. And I'm asking you to join our cause. We need your energy and your conviction and your commitment. I'm asking for you to pledge your support at mittromney.com. Get online. We need your voice and your vote in this campaign. [applause]
And I'm asking you to join in the fight for our freedom and ensure that tomorrow will be better than today. Let's go forward together and restore the promise of America. Together let's fight for the America we love. Thank you, and God bless this great land. God bless the United States of America. Thanks, you guys.

Remarks at the University of Chicago: "The Freedom to Dream"

March 19, 2012

Thanks to the University of Chicago for hosting us today.  It's good to see so many scholars from the School of Public Policy. And it is an honor to visit the campus that houses the Becker-Friedman Institute.
Milton Friedman used to tell a story about a trip he took to Asia in the 1960s.  Some government officials there asked him to visit the site of a massive public works project.  When he got there, he saw thousands of workers trying to build a canal with shovels.
Milton turned to one of the officials and asked him why there were so few machines.  The bureaucrat said, "You don't understand.  This is a jobs program."
Milton replied, "Oh, I thought you were trying to build a canal.  If it's jobs you want, then you should give these workers spoons, not shovels."
Milton Friedman knew what President Obama still has not learned, even after three years and hundreds of billions of dollars in spending:  The government does not create prosperity; free markets and free people do.
For three years, President Obama has expanded government instead of empowering the American people. He's put us deeper in debt. He's slowed the recovery and harmed our economy.  And he has attacked the cornerstone of American prosperity:  our economic freedom.
Today, I want to talk with you about why economic freedom is so critical — and how, as President, I will restore it in order to get our economy growing again.
This November, we face a defining decision.  Our choice will not be one of party or personality.
This election will be about principle.  Our economic freedom will be on the ballot.  And I intend to offer the American people a clear choice.
I spent 25 years in business. My work took me to many countries.  I was often struck by the enormous differences in the wealth and well-being of people living in different nations.  I was interested in how nations that were so close to each other in terms of geography could be so different in terms of prosperity.  Take, for example, Mexico and the United States, Israel and Egypt, Chile and Ecuador.
I read books that purported to explain the disparities between such nations. Jared Diamond argued it was largely due to their physical differences, their minerals and natural resources. But this only explained part of what I saw.
Then I read a book by historian David Landes called The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. In it, he traces the rise and fall of the great civilizations in history. After about 500 pages of scholarly analysis, he concludes with this observation: "If we learn anything from the history of economic development, it is that culture makes all the difference." Culture.
What is it about America's culture that made us the greatest economic power in the history of the earth? Many features come to mind: our work ethic, our appreciation for education, our willingness to take risk, our commitment to honor and oath, our family orientation, our devotion to a purpose greater than ourselves, our patriotism.
But one feature of our culture that propels the American economy stands out: freedom.
The American economy is fueled by freedom.
Free people and their free enterprises are what drive our economic vitality.
The Founding Fathers wrote that we are endowed by our Creator with the freedom to pursue happiness. In America, we would have economic freedom, just as we would have political and religious freedom. Here, we would not be limited by the circumstance of birth nor directed by the supposedly informed hand of government.  We would be free to pursue happiness as we wish.
The Founders were convinced that millions of people, all freely choosing their individual occupations and enterprises, all pursuing their individual dreams, would produce great prosperity.  And, they were right.
Economic freedom is the only force that has consistently succeeded in lifting people out of poverty.  It is the only principle that has ever created sustained prosperity. It is why our economy rose to rival those of the world's leading powers — and has long since surpassed them all.
Today, however, our status and our standing are in peril because the source of our economic strength is threatened.  Over the last several decades, and particularly over the last three years, Washington has increasingly encroached upon our freedom. The Obama administration's assault on our economic freedom is the principal reason why the recovery has been so tepid — why it couldn't meet their projections, let alone our expectations.  If we don't change course now, this assault on freedom could damage our economy and the well-being of American families for decades to come.
We see this attack on our freedom in every corner of the economy.
Let's start with taxes. By their very nature, they reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves.
And, yet, President Obama has proposed raising the marginal tax rate from 35% to 40%. He has proposed special breaks for his favorite industries, further increases for businesses he dislikes, and endless credits and subsidies intended to shape our behavior in this society. Think for a moment about what that does to the freedom to start a business or grow an enterprise.
Last week, I spoke with an entrepreneur in St. Louis. He and his son make amplifiers for electric guitars, but they recently had to lay off their other two employees. He said that, by his calculation, government takes 65% of what his business earns. President Obama wants to take even more.
If you invest your savings in a new business and are one of the fortunate few who see success — and make a profit — President Obama wants to take 40% of it.  And then add to that the payroll tax, the gas tax, and state and city income, property, and excise taxes.  And then factor in the regulatory burdens, whose costs far exceed the total of all income tax payments.  Pretty soon, those taxes and costs add up.  Businesses shut down.  Jobs disappear.  Entrepreneurs decide it's too risky and too costly to invest and to hire.
Dodd-Frank is another example.  It's an 848-page behemoth that will be followed by thousands and thousands of pages of new regulations.  Regulations are necessary. But burdensome regulations serve only to restrict freedom and imperil enterprise. The victims of those regulations are not nameless, faceless banks.  They're the employees, the business owners, and the customers who rely on those financial institutions.
This administration's burdensome regulations are even invading the freedom of everyday Americans.  Mike and Chantell Sackett run a small business in Idaho.  They saved enough money to buy a piece of property and build a modest home on it. But days after they broke ground, an EPA regulator told them to stop digging. The EPA said they were building on a wetland. But the Sacketts' property isn't on the wetlands register.  It sits in a residential area.
Nevertheless, the EPA wouldn't let them appeal the decision.  It told the Sacketts they weren't allowed to go to court.  An unelected government bureaucrat robbed them of their freedom.
They were given no recourse, no remedy.  They could do what the EPA wanted, or they could risk millions of dollars in fines.
Under President Obama, those same bureaucrats are insinuating themselves into every corner of the economy. They prevent drilling rigs from going to work in the Gulf.  They keep coal from being mined. They impede the reliable supply of natural gas.  They even tell farmers what their 15-year-old sons and daughters can and can't do on the family farm.
Will Rogers famously said, "This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as we do when the baby gets hold of a hammer.  It's just a question of how much damage he can do with it before you can take it away from him."
Will Rogers was concerned about the damage Congress could do.  But today, our freedom is never safe — because unelected, unaccountable regulators are always on the prowl. And under President Obama, they are multiplying like proverbial rabbits. The number of federal employees has grown by 140,000 under this president.
Those regulators do a lot of damage.  For every regulation, there are unintended consequences, underestimated costs, and unwanted influence from special interests.  And, of course, the bureaucratic impulse is to make more rules, never to reduce them.  All those regulations erode our freedom and stifle prosperity.
Now, the Obama assault on economic freedom is not limited to actions against individuals and enterprises; it extends to its intrusion upon the free marketplace itself. When government rather than the market routinely selects the winners and losers, enterprises cannot predict their prospects, and free enterprise is replaced with crony capitalism.
Solyndra, Ener1, Fisker, and Tesla are examples. When the government invested $500 million in Solyndra, you can imagine that scores of other solar energy entrepreneurs and enterprises either lost their investors or failed to find any. When the NLRB tried to shut down Boeing's plant in South Carolina, it sent a signal dissuading businesses of all kinds from making similar investments in right to work states, limiting their freedom. When General Motors shares were directed to the UAW, political payback replaced the rule of law, and the rule of law is fundamental to economic freedom.
When the heavy hand of government replaces the invisible hand of the market, economic freedom is the inevitable victim.
For centuries, the American Dream has meant the opportunity to build something new.  Some of America's greatest success stories are of people who started out with nothing but a good idea and a corner in their garage.  Too often today, Americans look at what it takes to start a business and they don't see promise and opportunity.  They see government standing in their way.
The real cost isn't just the taxes paid and money spent complying with the rules.  It's the businesses that are never started, the ideas that are never pursued, the dreams that are deferred.
We once built the interstate highway system and the Hoover Dam.  Today, we can't even build a pipeline.
We once led the world in manufacturing, exports, and infrastructure investment.  Today, we lead the world in lawsuits.
Labor unions once served as a symbol of worker rights, fair treatment, and a growing middle class.  Today, they too often represent the worst of special interests and crony capitalism.
But, now, after spending three years attacking business, President Obama hopes to erase his record with a speech.  In a recent address, he said that, "We are inventors.  We are builders.  We are makers of things.  We are Thomas Edison.  We are the Wright Brothers.  We are Bill Gates.  We are Steve Jobs."
The reality is that, under President Obama's administration, these pioneers would have found it much more difficult, if not impossible, to innovate, invent, and create.
Under Dodd-Frank, they would have struggled to get loans from their community banks.
A regulator would have shut down the Wright Brothers for their "dust pollution."
And the government would have banned Thomas Edison's light bulb. Oh yeah, Obama's regulators actually did just that.
Every great innovation, every world-changing business breakthrough begins with a dream. And nothing is more fragile than a dream. It is essential to the genius of America that we have developed a culture that nurtures these dreams and dreamers, that honors them and, yes, rewards them.
There has always been something uniquely brilliant about America. I don't believe this President understands this fundamental secret of America. And day by day, job-killing regulation by regulation, bureaucrat by bureaucrat, he is crushing the dream and the dreamers.
If we continue along this path, our lives will be ruled by bureaucrats and boards, commissions and czars.  That path erodes freedom.  It deadens the entrepreneurial spirit.
Freedom is becoming the victim of unbounded government appetite — and so is economic growth, job growth, and wage growth.  As government takes more and more, there is less and less incentive to take risk, to invest, to innovate, and to hire.
The proof is in this weak recovery.  This administration thinks our economy is struggling because the stimulus was too small.  The truth is we're struggling because our government is too big.
I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess.  I am offering a real choice and a new beginning.  And I have a conservative economic plan that will deliver more jobs, less debt, and smaller government.
My agenda takes America in the right direction.  It preserves freedom.  It encourages risk and innovation.  It fosters competition.  It allows Americans to pursue happiness as they choose — and will lead to greater opportunity.
Instead of expanding the government, I will shrink it.
Instead of raising taxes, I will cut them.
Instead of adding more regulations, I will reduce them with an overriding concern: do they help or do they hurt jobs?
That's just the beginning.  There is still more we can do.  Before we can create enduring prosperity, we must restore our economic freedom.
To build a strong America, we must empower Americans to pursue happiness as they choose, not as government directs.
We must restore the world's most competitive economy, not relinquish it to cronies and bureaucrats.
We must elect a President who puts his faith in free people, in free enterprises — and in the founding principles that made this country the greatest nation in history.
Together, let's restore America's promise by renewing our economic freedom.  Let us affirm our conviction that America is a land of opportunity and usher in a new era of enduring prosperity and American leadership.
Thank you.  God bless America.

Remarks in Schaumburg, Illinois Following the Illinois Primary

March 20, 2012

Thanks, you guys. So many great friends in this room and across Illinois. What a night. Thank you, Illinois. What a night. Wow. [applause]
And, of course, I'd like to congratulate my fellow candidates on a hard-fought contest here. I'd like to thank in particular the volunteers and our friends across the state and, frankly, in other states who've been working hard. I appreciate their unwavering support, through good times and bad.
And tonight, we thank the people of Illinois for their vote and for this extraordinary victory. Thank you so much. [applause]
And, you know, elections are about choices. And today, hundreds of thousands of people in Illinois have joined millions of people across the country to join our cause.
And this movement began on a small farm in New Hampshire on a sunny June day. We were surrounded by a small group of our friends and some supporters and family. We shared a conviction that the America we love was in trouble and adrift without strong leadership.
And three years of Barack Obama have brought us fewer jobs and shrinking paychecks, but many of us believed we were in danger of losing something even more than the value of our homes and our 401(k)s. After years of too many apologies and not enough jobs, historic drops in income and historic highs in gas prices, a president who doesn't hesitate to use all the means necessary to force through Obamacare on the American public, but leads from behind in the world.
It's time to say these words, this word: enough. We've had enough. [applause]
We -- we know our future. We know our future's brighter than these troubled times. We still believe in America. And we deserve a president who believes in us. And I believe in the American people. [applause]
Now, you know that yesterday I was giving a speech at the University of Chicago...[applause]... not -- not very far from here, not far from where Professor Barack Obama taught law. [laughter] [booing]
It was a speech on economic freedom. And as I was writing the speech, I thought to my lifetime of experiences. I've had a lot of opportunity to learn about the -- the unique genius of America's free enterprise system. It started, of course, with my dad. He didn't graduate from college. And he would tell me about his dad, who was a contractor. And you know about construction, up and down years. He -- he never quite made it, but he never gave up and raised great kids. Later, I helped start companies. And those began with just an idea, and somehow they made it through the difficult times and were able to create a good return for investors and thousands of jobs. And those jobs helped families buy their first homes. Those jobs put kids through school. Those jobs helped people live better lives, dream a little bigger.
For 25 years, I lived and breathed business and the economy and jobs. I had successes and failures. But each step of the way, I learned a little bit more about what it is that makes our American system so powerful. You can't learn that teaching constitutional law at University of Chicago, all right? [applause]
You -- you can't even learn that as a community organizer. [laughter]
The simple truth is that this president doesn't understand the genius of America's economy or the secret of the American economic success story. The American economy is fueled by freedom. [applause]
The history of the world has shown that economic freedom is the only force that has consistently lifted people out of poverty. It's the only principle that has ever been able to sustain prosperity. But over the last three years, this administration has been engaged in an all-out assault on our freedom.
Under this president, bureaucrats prevent drilling rigs from going to work in the gulf. They -- they keep coal from being mined. They impede the reliable supply of natural gas. They even tell farmers what their kids are able to do on their farms. This administration's assault on freedom has kept this so-called recovery from meeting their projections, let alone our expectations.
And now, by the way, the president is trying to erase his record with some new rhetoric. The other day he said this. He said, "We are inventors. We are builders. We are makers of things. We are Thomas Edison. We're the Wright brothers. We're Bill Gates. We're still jobs." Wait, I missed that. "We are Steve Jobs." [laughter]
That's true. But the problem is: He's still Barack Obama. [laughter] [applause]
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
ROMNEY: And, you see, under Barack Obama, those pioneers he mentioned would have faced a very difficult time trying to innovate and invent and invest and create and build jobs. You see, under Dodd- Frank, they would have found it almost impossible to get a loan from their community bank.
ROMNEY: And, of course, the regulators would have shut down the Wright brothers for dust pollution. [laughter]
You know -- and -- and, of course, the government would have banned Thomas Edison's light bulb. Oh, by the way, they just did, didn't they? Right? Yeah. [applause]
Now, you know that the real cost of these misguided policies, these attacks on economic freedom, this intrusion of the government into our freedom, the -- the cost of that are the ideas that are not pursued and the dreams that aren't realized and, therefore, all the little businesses that don't get started and the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of workers who don't get hired.
For centuries, the American dream has meant the opportunity to build something new. Some of America's greatest success stories are -- are people who started out with nothing but a good idea and a corner in their garage. But too often today, Americans who want to start a business or launch a new venture, they don't see promise and opportunity. They see government standing in the way. And I'm going to change that. We're going to get government out of the way. [applause]
You know, we -- we once built an Interstate Highway System and the Hoover Dam. Now we can't even build a pipeline. [laughter]
I mean, we -- we once led the world in manufacturing and exports, investment. Today, we lead the world in lawsuits. You know, when we replace a law professor with a conservative businessman as president, that's going to end. [applause]
I think -- I think you know this. Every great innovation, every world-changing business breakthrough begins with a dream. And nothing is more fragile than a dream. The genius of America is that we nurture those dreams and the dreamers. We honor them. And, yes, we reward them. That's part of what's uniquely brilliant about America. But day by day, job-killing regulation by job-killing regulation, bureaucrat by bureaucrat, this president is crushing the dream, and the dreamers and I will make sure that finally ends. [applause]
You know, the -- the proof -- the proof of the president's failure is seeing how tepid this economy -- this economic recovery is. I mean, this administration thinks that the economy's struggling because the stimulus wasn't large enough. [laughter]
The truth is, the economy is struggling because the government is too big. [applause]
You -- you and I know something the president still hasn't learned. Even after three years and hundreds of billions of dollars of spending and borrowing, it is not the government that creates our prosperity. The prosperity of America is the product of free markets and free people, and they must be protected and nurtured. [applause]
So tonight was a primary, but November is the general -- general election. And we're going to face a defining decision as a people. Our choice will not be about party or even personality. This election will be about principle. Our economic freedom will be on the ballot.
I'm offering a real choice and a new beginning. I'm running for president because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess. We know... [applause]
Look, we -- we know what Barack Obama's vision is. We've been living it these last three years. My vision is very, very, very different than what his is. You see, I -- I see an America where the prospects for our children will be better than even those that we've enjoyed during our lives, where the pursuit of success by all of us will unite us, not divide us, when the government finally understands...[applause]
I see a time when we'll finally have a government that understands it's better for more people to pay less in taxes than for a very few to pay a lot more. And... [applause]
And I see an America where the values we pass on to our children are greater than the debts we leave them. [applause]
I see an America where poverty is defeated by opportunity, not enabled by a government check. [applause]
I see an America that is humbled -- excuse me -- I seen an America that is humble, but it is never humbled, that leads, but is never led. I see an America that is so unquestionably strong that no one in the world would ever think of testing the might of our military. [applause]
Today -- today, we took an important step towards that America. Tomorrow, we'll take another. Each day, we move closer not just to victory, but to a better America. Join us. Join us. Together, we're going to ensure that America's greatest days are still ahead. [applause]
Thanks, you guys. Thank you so much. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

Remarks in Appleton, Wisconsin: "Freedom and Opportunity"

March 30, 2012

In 222 days, something pretty extraordinary is going to happen in the country. We'll have an election. Across this country, millions and millions of Americans will be able to do something that is really quite amazing: They will choose not only a President, but an entire House of Representatives and a third of the US Senate.
The entire world will be watching us. And by around midnight on November 6th, maybe a little earlier or a little later, we'll know the results of millions of Americans exercising their right to vote and in doing so, making a choice so profound that it is very difficult for any of us to grasp.
No one can predict the crisis the next President will confront nor what the world will look like at the end of the next President's term. In a world in which the economies of Athens, Wisconsin and Athens, Greece are connected, every decision becomes infinitely more complex.
But I believe Americans face a fundamental choice in this election, a decision that is much more important than the candidates or the political parties. We should understand that we are selecting not just who should guide us but a choice between two distinct paths and destinies for our nation.
In the days and months ahead, we should ask ourselves some very fundamental questions about who we are as a nation and who we are becoming. What does it mean to be an American in 2012? What will it mean in 2016 and beyond? Are we keeping faith with the great legacy — and trust — that has been handed to us by previous generations? And what America will we leave the next generation?
This campaign will produce a deafening cacophony of charges and counter charges and by November 6th, most Americans will probably be afraid to turn on their TV. So now, in this quiet before the storm, let's start with some basic facts about which there can be no debate.
Since Barack Obama became President, over 800,000 Americans have lost their jobs.
Millions of Americans spent longer looking for a job than ever before. Long-term unemployment is the worst since the Great Depression.
Over 46 million Americans are now living in poverty, more than ever before in our nation's history. In households with single moms, over 30% are living in poverty.
Forty-six and a half million Americans are now on food stamps, another record.
2.8 million homes have been foreclosed on.
New business startups are at the lowest level in 30 years.
Over 2,000 Chrysler and GM dealerships have closed and 22 automobile manufacturing plants have been shuttered or idled.  
Our yearly budget deficits are soaring and our national debt now stands at an all-time high. Barack Obama presided over the first trillion-dollar deficit in American history.  And he has repeated this dreadful distinction for each year he has been in office.
For the first time since World War II, our national debt is greater than the size of our entire economy. Each American's share of the national debt stands at $50,000.
President Obama did not cause the recession, but he most certainly failed to lead the recovery. His stimulus protected the government, not the people. It was promised to hold unemployment below eight percent. It did not. Barack Obama's stimulus was as ineffective as it was expensive.
His Obamacare didn't help create jobs either. It discouraged small businesses and health companies from hiring new workers. And Dodd-Frank hurt the community banks that provide loans to small businesses.  But the "Too Big To Fail" banks are even bigger today.
He failed to deliver on jobs, but on his goal to raise energy prices, he sure came through.  All in all, President Obama prolonged the recession and slowed the recovery. His economic strategy is a bust.
These troubling facts are President's Obama's legacy and now our shared history. As much as we would like to, we can't undo what has happened these past years. The families who have lost their homes, the factories that have closed, the students who had to drop out of college and those who never could make it in the door, all those missed chances and lost opportunities can't be regained.
And that's why it is important to understand one astonishing fact about this election: President Obama thinks he's doing a good job. No, I'm not kidding. He actually thinks he's doing a great job. An historically great job. According to the President, only Lincoln, FDR and Lyndon Johnson have accomplished more. And no, he didn't say that on Saturday Night Live.
How can this be? Is it that the President is just so disconnected from what is happening across America that he doesn't grasp the real consequences of his failures?
That answer is easy. The answer is yes. Of course. This is a President who was elected not on the strength of a compelling record but a compelling personality and story. There was much about the campaign of Barack Obama that appealed to many Americans. And though the reality has failed the hope and change he promised, he remains surrounded by true believers who attack anyone who challenges their power.  And, as we see each day, they will fight even more fiercely to hold on to that power.
All of this is to be expected. That power loves power and never lets go easily is hardly new. And that a White House has lost touch, well, I think we've seen that once or twice before.
But we should also remember that candidate Barack Obama pledged that he wanted to "transform this nation." And, unfortunately, that is exactly what he has been doing.  And that is one more reason why this election is so critical.
The choice before us could not be more profound.  Barack Obama and I have fundamentally different visions for America.
He has spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new Government-Centered Society.  I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of our Opportunity Society, led by free people and free enterprises.
Our different visions for America are the product of our values and our life experiences.  
Barack Obama once said that his work as a community organizer motivated him to help "communities that had been ravaged by plant closings."  His desire to help others could not be more admirable but it's clear that he saw free enterprise as the villain and not the solution.
The only real solution to help those communities devastated by lost jobs is more jobs. Barack Obama seems never to have understood the basic point that a plant closes when a business loses money.
So when this President attacks businesses for making money, and when his policies make it more difficult for businesses to make money, he is also attacking the very communities he wanted to help. That's how it works in America. Or at least that's how it works when America is working.
But under Barack Obama, America hasn't been working. The ironic tragedy is that the community organizer who wanted to help those hurt by a plant closing became the President on whose watch more jobs were lost than any time since the Great Depression.
Instead of doing everything possible to promote the power of the free enterprise system to create jobs and get us out of this economic crisis, Barack Obama has promoted the power of government. The results have been predictably dismal, but he has "transformed" us, as he likes to say, closer to his vision of a Government-Centered Society.
In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, the government must do more because the economy is doomed to do less. When you attack business and vilify success, you will have less business and less success. And then, of course the debate becomes about how much to extend unemployment insurance because you have guaranteed there will be millions more unemployed.
In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, government naturally allocates the rewards. Tax breaks are bestowed not to make us more productive or to grow a stronger economy but to reshape the society into what is currently fashionable and politically correct. Because business is inherently suspect, government regulators who know better must oversee and direct business decision-making.
In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, tax increases become not only a necessity but also a desired tool for social justice. In that world of shrinking means, there's a finite amount of money, and as someone once famously said, you need taxes to spread the wealth around.
In Barack Obama's Government-Centered Society, government spending will always increase because there's no reason to stop it. There's always someone who is entitled to something more, and who will vote for anyone who will give them something more.
In a Government-Centered Society, government dispenses the benefits, borrows what it can't take, and consumes a greater and greater share of the economy.
Today, government at all levels consumes 38 percent of the total economy or G.D.P. If Obamacare is allowed to stand, government will directly control almost half of the American economy.  And through the increasing controls government has imposed on industries like energy and financial services, and automobiles, it will indirectly or directly control well over half of our total economy.
One must ask whether we will still be a free enterprise nation and whether we will still have economic freedom. America is on the cusp of having a government-run economy. President Obama is transforming America into something very different than the land of the free and the land of opportunity.
We know where that transformation leads. There are other nations that have chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and stagnant wages. Sound familiar?
I don't want to transform America; I want to restore the values of economic freedom, opportunity, and small government that have made this nation the leader it is.
Freedom and opportunity have made America the most powerful economy in the world. They are the foundation of a nation with full employment, rising wages, and fiscal stability. The best thing we can do for the economic well-being of the people of America is not to grow government, it is to restore freedom and opportunity. It is opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans.
My grandfather was in the construction business and he never really made it himself.  But he helped convince my dad that he could accomplish anything he set his mind to. My dad didn't have the chance to finish college and he apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. Based on that excellent training, he went on to turn around a great car company and later became governor of Michigan.
My father made the most of opportunities that came before him, and by the time I came along — I was the fourth of four brothers and sisters — I had the chance to get the education my dad couldn't.
I loved cars and was tempted to stay in Michigan and go into the car business but I knew I would always wonder if any success I had was due to my father. So when I got out of business school, I stayed in Massachusetts and got an entry-level job with the best company that would hire me. More importantly, I was married and on the way to having five sons.
Over the next 25 years, my business career had many ups and downs, great successes, definite failures, but each step of the way I learned more about the transforming power of our great free enterprise system.  
I'm not naпve enough to believe that free enterprise is the solution to all of our problems — nor am I naпve enough to doubt that it is one of the greatest forces of good this world has ever known.  
Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, to make our lives better, than all of the government programs put together.
If we become one of those societies that attacks success, one outcome is certain — there will be a lot less success.
That's not who we are. The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, and took some risks, that there was the opportunity to build a better life for your family and for the next generation. It's not government's role to guarantee that every one of us will achieve the success we seek.
This nation was founded on the principle that we have a God-given right to pursue happiness. It is the pursuit that is guaranteed, not the result. It is the opportunity that is guaranteed, not the outcome. We are an Opportunity Nation.
Over the centuries, men and women pursuing happiness in their own unique ways have made ours the leading economy in the world, and as we look to the future, I am absolutely confident that the principles that created our strength are the very ones that will preserve it.
This means that government must be smaller and have strict limits placed on its power.  Obamacare violates both principles. I will repeal it.
Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That's why I will cut marginal tax rates across the board.
Regulations are necessary, but they must be continuously updated, streamlined, and modernized. Regulators should see part of their job as protecting economic freedom, promoting enterprise, and fostering job creation.
Workers should have the right to form unions, but unions should not be forced upon them. And unions should not have the power to take money out of their members' paychecks to buy the support of politicians favored by the union bosses.
In short, government must make America the best place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, small business and big business — for job creators of all kinds. Business is not the enemy. It is the friend of jobs, of rising wages, and of the revenues government needs to care for the poor and the elderly, and to provide for the national defense.  
Out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy, but they really don't like businesses very much.  But the economy is simply the product of all the nations' businesses added together.  So it's like saying you love omelettes but don't like eggs.
To build a strong economy that provides good jobs and rising wages and that reduces poverty, we need to build successful businesses of every kind imaginable.  And President Obama has been attacking successful businesses of every kind imaginable.
Apple Computer and Microsoft weren't started to save the world and neither were General Motors or Alcoa. Nor were some of the companies I helped start like Staples or The Sports Authority. All of these great American enterprises were started because innovators had great ideas and great ambitions. They became great commercial ventures, which is another way of saying they made a lot of money. Not just for a few people but for many people. They helped people buy homes, go to school, retire, start other companies.
We have always been the country where dreamers build dreams and where one dream helps launch another. And if those dreamers are rewarded with prosperity, we view that as a reason others would be encouraged to dream big as well.
We have to understand that today much of the world is hungry for the big dreamers with big ideas. America must fight to grow these dreamers and innovators, and to attract those from other lands.
My father had a favorite saying: "Nothing is as vulnerable as entrenched success." Today, because America has been so successful for so long, we seem to have forgotten what brought us here. America has become vulnerable to new competition, to looming debt, and to those who would substitute more government power for more freedom. We have made some bad choices and ignored the mounting threats.
But if the hill is a little steeper before us, we have always been a nation of big steppers.
In this last year, I have been all over this country, from student union cafeterias to kitchen tables, from factory breakrooms to boardrooms, and I've heard frustration and anger but rarely hopelessness. Many Americans have given up on this President but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America.
We have a sacred duty to restore the promise of America. And we will do it.  We will do it because we believe in America.
This Tuesday, join me. Join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the Promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger, the help wanted signs can be dusted off, and we can start again.
And this time we'll get it right. We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad. Together we'll build the greatest America we have ever known, where prosperity is grown and shared, not limited and divided, an America that guarantees that ours is the door that innovation and greatness always knocks on first.
There was a time — not so long ago — when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world.
Those days are coming back. That's our destiny. Join me. Walk together this Tuesday. And take another step every day until November 6th.
We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans!
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Remarks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Following the Wisconsin, Maryland, and District of Columbia Primaries

April 3, 2012

Thank you. Hey guys. Thank you. Congressman Ryan, he's a great leader, wonderful speaker, but he's not going to take Ann's place, I'm going to tell you that. [applause]
Thank you for providing the thank yous this evening, Congressman. Thank you all -- also to Senator Johnson and Congressman Sensenbrenner, appreciate their being here, the participation they've had in this process and thank you to Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C. We won them all. [applause]
This -- this really has been quite a night. We -- we won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of America. And here in the heartland, you know you're not going to find Americans with bigger hearts than the people of Wisconsin. [applause]
You know, but as I've been traveling across the state, I've -- I've visited with far too many whose hearts are filled with anxiety about their future.
So many good and decent people seem to be running harder just to stay in place. And -- and for many, no matter how hard they -- they're running, every day it seems to put them a little further behind. It's that way across so much of America, too much of America. Under this president's watch, more Americans have lost their jobs than during any other period since the Depression.
Millions have lost their homes. A record number of Americans are now living in poverty. And the most vulnerable are the ones that have been hurt the most. Thirty percent of single moms are now living in poverty.
New business startups -- and that's normally where we get job growth after a recession -- new business startups are down to the lowest level in 30 years. And of course, you know our national debt is at a record high. And when you drive home tonight and you stop by the gas station, just take a look at the prices. And then ask yourself, four more years of that?
I agree. [laughter]
And that's why it's important to understand one extraordinary fact about this election: President Obama thinks he is doing a good job. I'm not kidding. He actually thinks he is doing a great job. He thinks he's doing an historically great job, like Abraham Lincoln and LBJ and FDR, and no, he did not say this on "Saturday Night Live," all righty? [laughter]
It's enough -- it's enough to make you think that years of flying around on Air Force One, surrounded by an adoring staff of true believers, telling you that you're great and you are doing a great job, It's enough to make you think that you might become a little out of touch with that, and that's what's happened.
This campaign is going to deal with many complicated issues. But there is a basic choice that we're going to face. The president has pledged to transform America. And he's spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society. I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of a opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises. [applause]
And you know, the different visions we have I think are a product of the different lives we've led, the life experiences, the values we have. When he was a community organizer and communities were hurt by plant closings, his reaction was to turn to the government for help. He saw free enterprise as the villain and government as the solution.
He never seemed to grasp the very basic point that a plant closes when a business loses money. So today, when the president attacks business, and when his policies make it more difficult for business to grow and prosper, he's also attacking the very communities he had wanted to help. Or at least that's how it works when America is working.
But under Barack Obama, America hasn't been working. The ironic tragedy is that the community organizer who wanted to help those that were hurt by a plant closing became the president on whose watch more jobs have been lost any time since the Great Depression.
In Barack Obama's government-centered society, the government has to do more because the economy is doomed to do less, because when you attack business and you vilify success, you are going to have less business and less success.
And then, of course, the debate becomes about how much to extend unemployment insurance because you've guaranteed there will be millions more unemployed. In Barack Obama's government-centered society, tax increases not only become a necessity, but also a desired tool for social justice.
In that world of shrinking means, there is a finite amount of money. And as someone once famously said, you need to have some taxes to spread the wealth around. [laughter]
In Barack Obama's government-centered society, government spending always increases because, well, why not? There's always someone who's entitled to something more and who's willing to vote for anyone who will give them something more.
Now, by the way, we know where that kind of -- you know, that transformation of a -- of a free society into a government-centered society leads, because there are other nations that have followed that path. And it leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt and stagnant wages. This is beginning to sound familiar, isn't it?
I don't want to transform America. I want to restore to America the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world. [applause]
It's opportunity. It's opportunity, not a check from government -- it's opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans. Now I am not naive enough to believe that free enterprise is a solution to all of our problems. But nor am I naive enough to doubt that it is one of the greatest forces for good this world has ever known.
Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, and to make our lives better than all the programs of government combined. [applause]
If we become one of those societies that attack success, why not come as certain there will be a lot less success? And that's not who we are. The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, had the right values, took some risks, that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation.
This means that government has to be smaller and have strict limits placed on its power. ObamaCare violates both those principles, and I will get rid of it. [applause]
Taxes have to be as low as possible and in line with those of the competing nations around the world, designed to foster innovation and growth, that's why I will cut marginal taxes across the board. I want to create good jobs in this country. Let's get the taxes down for employers.
Now we, of course, understand in a free market that regulations are necessary and critical, but they have to be continuously updated, streamlined, modernized, and regulators have to see their job not just as cracking down on the bad guys but also as protecting economic freedom and promoting enterprise and fostering job creation. Washington has to become an ally of business, not the opposition of business. [applause]
Now workers should have the right to join unions. But unions should not be forced upon workers. And unions should not have the power to take money our of their members' paychecks to buy the support of politicians that are favored by the union bosses. [applause]
You know, out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy, but in everything they do, they show they don't like business very much. But the economy, of course, is simply the product of all the businesses of the nation added together. So it's a bit like saying you like an omelet, but you don't like eggs. [laughter]
You know, to build a strong economy that provides good jobs and rising wages and that reduces poverty, we have to build successful businesses of every kind imaginable. And President Obama has been attacking successful businesses of every kind imaginable.
We have always been a country of dreamers, where dreamers can have dreams, where one dream helps launch another. And if those dreamers are rewarded with prosperity, we view that as a reason that other may be encouraged to dream big as well.
Now these last few years have been difficult, made a lot worse by the mistakes and failures of the president's leadership. But if the hill before is a little steeper, we've always been a nation of big steppers.
In this last year, I've been all over the country, from student unions to kitchen tables, from factory breakrooms to boardrooms. And I've heard frustration and anger, but rarely hopelessness. A lot of Americans have given up on the president. But they haven't thought about giving up, not on themselves, not on each other, and not on America. [applause]
We have a duty -- we have a duty placed upon our shoulders by the founders of the nation, a sacred duty to restore the promise of America, and we will do it. And we will do it because we believe in America.
Tonight, I'm asking the good people of Pennsylvania, and New York, Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut to join me. Join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger.
Help wanted signs can get dusted off and put in the front yard and we can start again. And this time we're going to get it right. We will stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad. [applause]
Together, we will build the greatest America we've ever known, where prosperity is grown and shared, not limited and divided, an America that guarantees that ours is the door that innovation and greatness always knocks on first.
There was a time not so long ago when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world had. We're Americans. That meant something different to each of us, but something special to all of us.
We knew it without question -- so did the people in the rest of the world -- those days are coming back. That's our destiny. So join me, walk together, take another step every day until November 6th. We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans.
God bless this country. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thanks, you guys. Thanks for the victory in Wisconsin and Maryland and District of Columbia. Thanks, you guys. Thank you.

Excerpt of Remarks in Waukesha, Wisconsin

April 3, 2012

"This is a tough time, and so the President put an ad out yesterday talking about gasoline prices and how high they are, and guess who he blamed? Me! Why, maybe after I'm president I can take responsibility for things I might have done wrong, but this president doesn't want to take responsibility for his mistakes. I mean talk about someone who is running as far away from Harry Truman's dictum as possible. Harry Truman had the sign on his desk that said ‘The Buck Stops Here,' but this president is always looking for somewhere else to point." — Mitt Romney

Waukesha, WI
April 3, 2012
Click Here To View Mitt Romney Discuss Why President Obama Is Responsible For Higher Energy Prices
Mitt Romney: "The President has been busy over the last couple of days, doing what he likes to do a great deal, which is finding someone to blame for his own problems. If you're going by the gas station these days, it's kind of a frightening experience and your credit card may max out, the pump may stop if it hits $100. If you've got an SUV or a pick-up truck, it's going to do like yours did, Congressman, it may hit $100. A lot of people are seeing $60, $70, $80 to fill up a tank of gas. You've got a lot of folks, particularly single-moms and people who are just working at the edge that are having a hard time getting to and from work. This is a tough time, and so the President put an ad out yesterday talking about gasoline prices and how high they are, and guess who he blamed? Me! Why, maybe after I'm president I can take responsibility for things I might have done wrong, but this president doesn't want to take responsibility for his mistakes. I mean talk about someone who is running as far away from Harry Truman's dictum as possible. Harry Truman had the sign on his desk that said ‘The Buck Stops Here,' but this president is always looking for somewhere else to point. And so he talks about how oil production is up during his term, which of course has nothing to do with him. It has everything to do with his predecessors opening up land for leases and permits and also for drilling going on private land, which he hasn't been able to stop... Yet. And so during his term, by the way, the number of leases on government land has been cut in half. The number of permits given to people to drill, that's been cut to one-third of what it was before. He was the one [who] stopped the drilling in the Gulf, that said no to drilling in ANWR, no to drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. That this is a person who has done everything he can to make it harder to take advantage of our fossil fuels in this country from coal to gas to natural gas. And if we're going to have an American policy that keeps our energy dollars in America and keeps us from being beholden to the cartel in the oil world, why we're going to have to have our own resources. If I'm President of the United States, rather than saying no to oil, gas and coal and also no to the pipeline from Canada, I will say yes to those and get that pipeline off the ground and get this country energy secure."

Remarks to the Newspaper Association of America in Washington, D.C.

April 4, 2012

Over the last ten months, I've come to know a good deal about some of the journalists who write for your newspapers.
We've aired our dirty laundry together — sometimes literally as well as figuratively. We've bathed hour upon hour in the fine diesel aroma of a campaign bus. And we've shared more birthdays and holidays with each other than with our families.
One of the reporters covering our campaign is Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times. For Maeve's birthday, I got her a cake and sang her a birthday song. For my birthday, she was kind enough to remind me that I'm now old enough to qualify for Medicare.
In just the few years since my last campaign, the changes in your industry are striking. Then, I looked to Drudge or FOX or CNN online to see what stories were developing. Hours after a speech, it was being dissected on the Internet. Now, it's Twitter, and instantaneous reaction. In 2008, the coverage was about what I said in my speech. These days, it's about what brand of jeans I am wearing and what I ate for lunch.
Most people in my position are convinced that you are biased against us. We identify with LBJ's famous quip that if he were to walk on water, your headline would read: "President Can't Swim."
Some people thus welcome the tumult in your industry, heralding the new voices and the unfiltered or supposedly unbiased sources. Frankly, in some of the new media, I find myself missing the presence of editors to exercise quality control. I miss the days of two or more sources for a story — when at least one source was actually named.
How your industry will change, I cannot predict. I subscribe to Yogi Berra's dictum: "Forecasting is very difficult, especially when it involves the future."
But I do know this: You will continue to find ways to provide the American people with reliable information that is vital to our lives and to our nation. And I am confident that the press will remain free. But further, I salute this organization and your various institutions in your effort to make it not only free, but also responsible, accurate, relevant, and integral to the functioning of our democracy.
Given the number and scale of our nation's current challenges, the November election will have particular consequence. It will be a defining event. President Obama and I have very different visions for America, both of what it means to be an American today and what it will mean in the future.
The voters will expect each of us to put our respective views on the table. We will each make our case, buttressed by our experience. The voters will hear the debates, be buffeted by advertising, and be informed by your coverage. And hopefully after all this, they will have an accurate understanding of the different directions we would take and the different choices we would make.
Of course, for that to happen, the candidates must be candid about their views and plans. And, in that regard, President Obama's comments to President Medvedev are deeply troubling. That incident calls his candor into serious question. He does not want to share his real plans before the election, either with the public or with the press. By flexibility, he means that "what the American public doesn't know won't hurt him." He is intent on hiding. You and I will have to do the seeking.
Barack Obama's exchange with the Russian President raises all kinds of serious questions: What exactly does President Obama intend to do differently once he is no longer accountable to the voters? Why does "flexibility" with foreign leaders require less accountability to the American people? And, on what other issues will he state his true position only after the election is over?
But instead of answering those vital questions, President Obama came here yesterday and railed against arguments no one is making — and criticized policies no one is proposing. It's one of his favorite strategies — setting up straw men to distract from his record.
And while I understand why the President doesn't want to run on his record, he can't run from his record either.
As I have said many times before, the President did not cause the economic crisis, but he made it worse. He delayed the recovery, and made it anemic.
When he took office, millions of Americans looked to him to turn around the economy and lead us back to full employment. He failed these Americans.
The first three rules of any turnaround are focus, focus, and focus. But instead of focusing his attention on the economy, he delegated the stimulus to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.
The $787 billion stimulus included a grab bag of pet projects that had languished in Congress for good reason, for years. It was less a jobs plan and more the mother of all earmarks. The administration pledged that it would keep unemployment below 8%... it has been above 8% every month since.
The President's attention was elsewhere--like a government takeover of healthcare and apologizing for America abroad.
He handed out tens of billions of dollars to green energy companies, including his friends and campaign contributors at companies like Solyndra that are now bankrupt.
President Obama's answer to our economic crisis was more spending, more debt, and more government. By the end of his term in office, he will have added nearly as much public debt as all the prior Presidents combined. No President had ever run a trillion dollar deficit. The "New Normal" the President would have us embrace is trillion dollar deficits and eight percent unemployment.
Through it all, President Obama has failed to even pass a budget. In February, he put forward a proposal that included the largest tax increase in history, and still left our national debt spiraling out of control. The House rejected it unanimously.
Of course, no fiscal challenge is greater than the one we face with entitlements. As the President himself acknowledged three years ago, this is not a problem that we can kick down the road any further.
I'd be willing to consider the President's plan, but he doesn't have one. That's right: In over three years, he has failed to enact or even propose a serious plan to solve our entitlement crisis.
Instead, he has taken a series of steps that end Medicare as we know it.
He is the only President to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare. And, as a result, more than half of doctors say they will cut back on treating seniors.
He is destroying the Medicare Advantage program, eliminating the coverage that millions of seniors depend on and reducing choice by two-thirds.
To control Medicare cost, he has created an unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to prevent Medicare from providing certain treatments. The result will be fewer treatments and services available to patients in need, and nowhere else to turn.
A couple of months ago, we saw a fascinating exchange on Capitol Hill that epitomized not only this administration's inaction on entitlements, but also its appalling lack of leadership. The President's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, was testifying before Congress. And Congressman Paul Ryan — who, unlike this President, has had the courage to offer serious solutions to the problems we face — was pressing Geithner on the administration's failure to lead on entitlement reform. Geithner's response was this: "We are not coming before you today to say we have a definitive solution to that long term problem. What we do know is we don't like yours."
Take a moment and think about that: We don't have a solution. All we know is we don't like yours. It almost makes one long for the days when the President simply led from behind.
And now, in the middle of the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression, the President purports to have experienced a series of election-year conversions.
As President, he has repeatedly called for tax increases on businesses. Now, as candidate Obama, he decides that a lower corporate tax rate would be better.
As President, he's added regulations at a staggering rate. Now, as candidate Obama, he says he wants to find ways to reduce them.
As President, he delayed the development of our oil and coal and natural gas. Now, as candidate Obama, he says he favors an energy policy that adopts an all-of-the-above approach.
Nancy Pelosi famously said that we would have to pass Obamacare to find out what was in it. President Obama has turned that advice into a campaign strategy: He wants us to re-elect him so we can find out what he will actually do.
With all the challenges the nation faces, this is not the time for President Obama's hide and seek campaign.
President Obama has said that he wants to transform America. I don't want to transform America; I want to restore the values of economic freedom, opportunity, and small government that have made this nation the leader it is.
It is opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans.
My grandfather was in the construction business and he never really made it himself. But he convinced my dad that he could accomplish anything he set his mind to. My dad didn't have the chance to finish college and he apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. Based on that excellent training, he went on to turn around a great car company and later became governor of Michigan.
My father made the most of opportunities that came before him, and by the time I came along — I was the fourth of four brothers and sisters — I had the chance to get the education my dad couldn't.
I loved cars and was tempted to stay in Michigan and go into the car business but I knew I would always wonder if any success I had was due to my dad. So when I got out of business school, I stayed in Massachusetts and got a job with the best company that would hire me. More importantly, I was married and on the way to having five sons.
Over the next 25 years, my business career had many ups and downs, great successes, definite failures, but each step of the way I learned more about the power of our great free enterprise system.
I'm not naпve enough to believe that free enterprise is the solution to all of our problems — nor am I naпve enough to doubt that it is one of the greatest forces of good this world has ever known.
Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, to make our lives better, than all of the government programs put together.
If we become one of those societies that attack success, one outcome is certain — there will be a lot less success.
That's not who we are. The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, and took some risks, that there was the opportunity to build a better life for your family and for the next generation.
I'm offering a clear choice and a different path. Unlike the President, I have a record that I am proud to run on.
After my years in business, I used my experience to help save an Olympics and help turn around a state. When I became the governor of Massachusetts, the state budget was out of control and the legislature was 85% Democrat. We cut taxes 19 times and balanced the budget all four years. We erased a $3 billion budget shortfall and left office with a $2 billion rainy day fund. I cast over 800 vetoes and cut entire programs. If there was a program, an agency, or a department that needed cutting, we cut it. One commentator said that I didn't just go after the sacred cows; I went after the whole herd. And I can't wait to get my hands on Washington.
Unlike President Obama, you don't have to wait until after the election to find out what I believe in — or what my plans are. I have a pro-growth agenda that will get our economy back on track — and get Americans back to work.
This administration thinks our economy is struggling because the stimulus was too small. The truth is we're struggling because our government is too big. As President, I will get the government out of the way and unleash the power of American enterprise and innovation.
Seven months ago, I presented a detailed plan for jobs and economic growth, including 59 different proposals that would help strengthen the economy. I understand some people are amused that I have so many ideas. But I think the American people will prefer it to President Obama's grand total of zero.
I will cut marginal tax rates across the board for individuals and corporations, and limit deductions and exclusions. I will repeal burdensome regulations, and prevent the bureaucracy from writing new ones. I will unleash our domestic energy resources so that we can finally get the energy we need at a price we can afford.
Instead of picking winners and losers with taxpayer dollars, I will make sure that every entrepreneur gets a fair shot and that every business plays by the same rules. I will create an environment where our businesses and workers can compete and win. I will welcome the best and the brightest to our shores, and ensure that we have labor and training policies that help American workers to be more competitive.
Instead of growing the federal government, I will shrink it. I will repeal Obamacare, and cut programs that we cannot afford. I will send to the states those programs they can implement with better results at lower cost.
I have already proposed a plan that will save and strengthen Medicare and Social Security for future generations. And, unlike President Obama, I have the courage to stand behind my plan and the leadership to enact it.
My plan preserves these programs for those at or near retirement and strengthens them for future generations — without tax increases. I will gradually raise the retirement age for Social Security, and reduce the rate of benefit growth for tomorrow's higher income seniors. I will introduce market competition and consumer choice to Medicare, while also preserving traditional Medicare coverage as an option, so that future seniors can get higher quality care at lower cost.
This November, we will face a defining decision. Our choice will not be one of party or personality. This election will be about principle. Freedom and opportunity will be on the ballot.
I am offering a real choice and a new beginning. I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess. We know what Barack Obama's vision of America is — we've all lived it the last three years. Mine is very different.
I see an America where we know the prospects for our children will be better than our own; where the pursuit of success unites us, not divides us; where the values we pass on to our children are greater than the debts we leave them; where poverty is defeated by opportunity, not enabled by a government check.
I see an America that is humble but never humbled, that leads but is never lead.
In this campaign, I will lead us toward that America. We wage this campaign as Republicans or Democrats, but we share a destiny as Americans. Together, we will ensure that America's greatest days are yet ahead.
Thank you and God bless.

Excerpt of Remarks in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania

April 5, 2012

"The other day, he said he was for 'all of the above' in the energy world. And I thought: how in the world can he be saying that? Then I realized he probably means he's for all the energy sources above the ground, all right. So he's for solar and wind, which are just fine, but he doesn't like coal, oil, gas because they're below ground. Now we understand 'Obama-speak' a little better. I'm actually for everything that comes from above and everything that comes from below. I want to get energy in this country and become energy secure." — Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney: "[President Obama] said the other day, by the way, did you hear that he said that... You know, sometimes you hear what he says but it's such striking contrast with what he does, I mean it's like your head goes around. You know, you just wonder, can he really be saying that? The other day, he said he was for 'all of the above' in the energy world. And I thought: how in the world can he be saying that?

Excerpt of Remarks in Hartford, Connecticut

April 11, 2012

"This president has failed America's women. And if I'm the next President of the United States, I will go to work to get American women good jobs, rising incomes, and growing businesses." —Mitt Romney
Remarks
Hartford, CT
April 11, 2012
Mitt Romney: "I was disappointed in listening to the President as he's saying ‘Republicans are waging a war on women.' The real war on women is being waged by the President's failed economic policies. ... These are just some statistics which show just how severe the war on women has been by virtue of the President's failed policies. The number of jobs ... this is an amazing statistic ... the percentage of jobs lost by women in the President's three years, three and a half years, 92.3 percent of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women. 92.3 percent! Now, the President says 'I didn't cause this recession.' That's true. He just made it worse. And made it last longer. And because it lasted longer, more and more women lost jobs such that in his three and a half years, 92.3 percent of the people who have lost jobs have been women. His failures have hurt women. More information: What president has the worst record on female labor force participation? Barack Obama. In history, we've gone back twenty years. The progress that was made of more women getting into the workforce has been stepped back twenty years by virtue of this president's policies. Under President Obama, 858,000 more women are out of work. 858,000 more women out of work under this president. And finally, the total female unemployment rate has gone from 7 percent when he took office in January 2009 to 8.1 percent in March of 2012. This president has failed America's women. And if I'm the next President of the United States, I will go to work to get American women good jobs, rising incomes, and growing businesses."

Remarks to the National Rifle Association National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri

April 13, 2012

Chris Cox, thank you for that kind introduction.
And thanks to all of you for that warm welcome.
It's great to be with so many friends from the National Rifle Association.
This fine organization is sometimes called a single-issue group.
That's high praise when the single issue is freedom.
All of you can be proud of your long and unwavering defense of our constitutional rights and liberties.
In 207 days, we'll do something that is really quite amazing:
Americans will choose not only a President but an entire House of Representatives and a third of the US Senate.
The entire world will be watching us.
And by around midnight on November 6th, maybe a little earlier or later, we'll know the results of millions of Americans exercising their right to vote.
In doing so, Americans will make a profound choice, a decision that is much more important than the candidates or the political parties.
We will not just select the President who will guide us; we will also choose between two distinct paths and destinies for our nation.
So many of the big issues in this campaign turn on our understanding of the Constitution and how it was meant to guide the life of our nation.
It was one of Missouri's greatest sons, Harry Truman, who expressed a guiding conviction that you and I share.
In a ceremony that placed the Constitution and Declaration in the permanent care of the National Archives, President Truman offered a word of caution.
Liberty, he said, "can be lost, and it will be, if the time ever comes when these documents are regarded not as the supreme expression of our profound belief, but merely as curiosities in glass cases."
Truman believed, as we do, that the principles of our Constitution are enduring and universal...that they were not designed to bend to the will of presidents and justices who come and go.
The belief that we are all created equal, that we are endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights — these are not relics from another time, they reflect truths that are valid in every era.
The framework of law created by the Declaration and the Constitution is the source of our greatness.
It has generated unparalleled opportunity and prosperity.
Our Founders understood this, which is why they created a system of government that is limited.
This President is moving us away from our Founders' vision.
Instead of limited government, he is leading us toward limited freedom and limited opportunity.
This November, we face a defining decision.
I am offering a real choice and a new beginning.
I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to lead us in a different direction.
We know what Barack Obama's vision of America is — we've all lived it the last three years.
Mine is very different.
My course restores and protects our freedoms.
As President, the Constitution would be my guide, and the Declaration of Independence my compass.
Today, I want to talk about this administration's assault on our freedoms — our economic freedom, our religious freedom, and our personal freedom.
And I want to share my plans to return America to the first principles of our founding.
The American economy is fueled by freedom. Free people and their free enterprises are what drive our economic vitality.
The Obama administration's assault on our economic freedom is the principal reason why the recovery has been so tepid — why it couldn't meet their projections, let alone our expectations.
The President's assault on economic freedom begins with his tax hikes.
By their very nature, taxes reduce our freedom. Their only role in a free economy should be to fund services that are absolutely essential, such as national security, education, and the care of those who cannot care for themselves.
And, yet, President Obama has proposed raising the marginal tax rate from 35% to 40%. The Vice President has proposed a new global business tax. Medical device companies are soon to be subject to a new tax on revenues. And the President is now touring the country, touting a new tax on investment and the wealthy. Congress does not need more money to spend; Congress needs to learn to spend less!
Dodd-Frank is another example of the President's attack on economic freedom. It's an 848-page behemoth that will be followed by thousands and thousands of pages of new regulations. Regulations are necessary. But burdensome regulations serve only to restrict freedom and imperil enterprise. The victims of those regulations are not nameless, faceless banks. They're the employees, the business owners, and the customers who rely on financial institutions that lose out.
Under President Obama, bureaucrats are insinuating themselves into every corner of our economy, undermining economic freedom. They prevent drilling rigs from going to work in the Gulf. They keep coal from being mined. They impede the reliable supply of natural gas. They tell farmers what their children can and can't do to help on the farm.
Will Rogers famously said that he worried whenever Congress was in session. Today, our freedom is never safe — because unelected, unaccountable regulators are always on the prowl. And under President Obama, they are multiplying. The number of federal employees has grown by almost 150,000 under this president.
For centuries, the American Dream has meant the opportunity to build something new. Some of America's greatest success stories are of people who started out with nothing but a good idea and a corner in their garage. Today, Americans look at what it takes to start a business and they don't see promise and opportunity. They see government standing in their way.
The real cost isn't just the taxes paid and money spent complying with the rules. It's the businesses that are never started, the ideas that are never pursued, the dreams that are never realized.
We once built the interstate highway system and the Hoover Dam. Today, we can't even build a pipeline.
We once led the world in manufacturing, exports, and infrastructure investment. Today, we lead the world in lawsuits.
We once led the world in educating our kids. Today, half the kids in our fifty largest cities won't even graduate from high school.
If we continue along this path, we'll spend our lives filling out forms, complying with excessive regulations and pleading with political appointees for waivers, subsidies and permission. That path erodes freedom. It deadens the entrepreneurial spirit. And it hurts the very people it's supposed to help.
Freedom is the victim of unbounded government appetite — and so is economic growth, job growth, and wage growth. As government takes more and more, there is less and less incentive to take risk, to invest, to innovate, and to hire.
This administration thinks our economy is struggling because the stimulus was too small. The truth is we're struggling because our government is too big.
I am running for President because I have the experience and vision to get us out of this mess. My agenda takes America in the right direction. It preserves freedom. It encourages risk taking and innovation. It fosters competition. It promotes opportunity.
Instead of expanding the government, I will shrink it.
Instead of raising taxes, I will cut them.
Instead of adding regulations, I will scale them back.
The answer for a weak economy is not more government. It is more freedom!
Economic freedom has not been the Obama administration's only target. Our first freedom — our religious freedom — has also been under attack.
Recently, in a labor regulation case, the government claimed that a church should not be free to determine who qualifies as a minister under the law.
It claimed that the government instead could interfere with that decision. The government! The Constitution came to the rescue: the Supreme Court rejected the Obama administration's attack, in a 9-0 unanimous decision.
Now, the Obama administration has decided that it has the power to mandate what Catholic charities, schools, and hospitals must cover in their insurance plans. It's easy to forget how often President Obama assured us that under Obamacare, nothing in our insurance plans would have to change. Remember that one? Well, here we are, just getting started with Obamacare, and the federal government is already dictating to religious groups on matters of doctrine and conscience.
In all of America, there is no larger private provider of healthcare for women and their babies than the Catholic Church. But that's not enough for the Obamacare bureaucrats. No, they want Catholics to fall in line and violate the tenets of their faith.
As President, I will follow a very different path than President Obama. I will be a staunch defender of religious freedom. The Obamacare regulation is not a threat and insult to only one religious group — it is a threat and insult to every religious group. As President, I will abolish it.
Like economic and religious freedom, our personal freedoms have been under attack.
Few things are more important to us than our health, and our healthcare. The 10th amendment preserves the right to choose our own healthcare, and all rights not specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution, to the states, and to the people. Obamacare violates the Constitution. I'm counting on the Supreme Court to say exactly that.
But it's not just health care. Mike and Chantell Sackett have seen firsthand how the Obama government interferes with personal freedom. They run a small business in Idaho. They saved enough money to buy a piece of property and build a home. But days after they broke ground, an EPA regulator told them to stop digging. The EPA said they were building on a wetland. But the Sackett's property isn't on the wetlands register. It sits in a residential area. Nevertheless, the EPA wouldn't even let them appeal the decision. Fortunately, the Constitution confronted the Obama administration: the Supreme Court ruled unanimously for the Sacketts and against the Obama EPA.
This administration's attack on freedom extends even to rights explicitly guaranteed by our Constitution. The right to bear arms is so plainly stated, so unambiguous, that liberals have a hard time challenging it directly. Instead, they've been employing every imaginable ploy to restrict it.
I applaud true conservationists like Rob Keck who work to preserve lands, herds and flocks for hunting. I applaud Ambassador Bolton for opposing international efforts to erode our rights. I applaud Congressman Issa and Senator Grassley for their work in exposing the "Fast and Furious" scandal. And I applaud NRA leadership for being among the first and most vocal in calling upon Attorney General Holder to resign.
We need a President who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners.
President Obama has not; I will.
We need a President who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those seeking to protect their homes and their families. President Obama has not; I will.
And if we are going to safeguard our Second Amendment, it is time to elect a president who will defend the rights President Obama ignores or minimizes. I will.
We've seen enough of President Obama over the last three years to know that we don't need another four.
In a second term, he would be unrestrained by the demands of re-election. As he told the Russian president last month when he thought no one else was listening, after his re-election he'll have a lot more, quote, "flexibility" to do what he wants. I'm not exactly sure what he meant by that, but looking at his first three years, I have a very good idea.
Consider the courts. President Obama has an unusual view of the Supreme Court and its responsibilities, as he reminded us just the other day. He said, quote, "I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress."
Of course, what President Obama calls "extraordinary" and "unprecedented," the rest of us recognize as "judicial review." That concept has been a centerpiece of our constitutional system since 1803.
Judicial review requires that the Supreme Court strike down any law that violates the Constitution — the founding document that is the bulwark of our freedoms. But President Obama seems to believe that Court decisions are only legitimate when they rule in his favor, and illegitimate if they don't. He thinks our nation's highest court is to be revered and respected — as long as it remains faithful to the original intent of Barack Obama.
That's the problem with those who view the Constitution as living and evolving, not timeless and defining. They never explain just who will decide what the Constitution means and in which way it will "evolve."
In his first term, we've seen the president try to browbeat the Supreme Court. In a second term, he would remake it. Our freedoms would be in the hands of an Obama Court, not just for four years, but for the next 40. That must not happen.
As President, I will uphold the rule of law — and put America back on the path toward the Founders' vision. I don't want to transform America; I want to return America to the principles that made this nation great.
Our Founders began this great American Experiment. They created a nation conceived in liberty and they entrusted us with the duty to preserve it and defend it.
In the generations since, more than a million Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice.
One day toward the end of my term, my office got a call telling us that a soldier had been killed in Iraq. His casket was on a U.S. Airways flight, but his family had not been notified in time to get to the airport and receive his body. I was asked if I could go to the airport in their stead. I said, of course.
We drove over to the airport and on to the tarmac. The jet came in and the people disembarked. The luggage came down the conveyor, and then, after a little while, the casket appeared.
The State Troopers who were there with me all saluted. I put my hand on my heart. And then I glanced up at the terminal. There's a big wall of glass at the U.S. Airways terminal in Boston right where the plane had come in. The people coming off the plane had seen the police cars, so they'd stopped to see what was going on. And then the people walking down the hall saw the people leaning up against the glass, so they pulled up behind them. A huge crowd had formed up there.
Every single person had their hand on their heart.
When I think of our country, scenes like this come to mind. Should I have the honor of serving as president, that's how I will seek to lead — not by pitting one group against another, but by bringing us together.
Americans want a leader who will tell them the truth, who will live with integrity, and who will preserve this great nation — and protect our Constitution.
We have a sacred duty to restore the promise of America. And we will do it. We will do it because we believe in America.
We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad.
There was a time — not so long ago — when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world.
Those days are coming back. That's our destiny.
We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans!
Join me in this great cause.
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Excerpt of Remarks in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania

"And note that there are some differences in the campaign coming forward. Which is the President, our current president, is intent on raising tax rates, particularly for small business." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "And note that there are some differences in the campaign coming forward. Which is the President, our current president, is intent on raising tax rates, particularly for small business. Most small businesses are taxed at the individual tax rate—meaning they don't pay a corporate tax, they pay individual tax rates and so he wants to raise the tax rates from 35 percent to 40 percent. That will impact a lot of small businesses and probably lead to some businesses having to lay people off. There's another tax that he has proposed, and that is now in law, which is the Obamacare tax, which is applied to companies that make medical devices and instruments and so forth. And that tax is about 2.3 percent of your sales—not of your profit, but of your sales. And so that's going to have a big impact on employers that are in the medical field, as you are. And then of course the Vice President the other day proposed another tax, which he said is a global tax on business. I'm not quite sure what that is, but that will surely cost jobs as well. And the President, of course, has been campaigning for something known as the Buffett Rule, the Buffett Tax. And I understand that was defeated in the Senate yesterday, so that's probably not going to happen, but not a tax that had much of an impact. As a matter of fact, someone calculated that that tax would raise enough revenue to pay for government for eleven hours. So it was more of a gimmick than it was a real proposal to reform our tax system and make life a little easier. My own plan is to lower the tax rates, but also limit some of the deductions and exemptions and breaks, particularly for high income folks, so we can continue to get the revenue we've been getting — when I say we, I'm talking about the government — but can do so in a tax structure that's simpler and with rates that are a little lower so that businesses can afford to hire and expand and people can have a little easier time making ends meet."

Excerpt of Remarks in Charlotte, North Carolina

April 18, 2012

"Virtually nothing the President has done, including his stimulus, which protected government but did not encourage the private sector, virtually nothing he has done has made it more likely for people to get jobs. And so, for three-and-a-half years, we've had unemployment above 8 percent. He set the measure; he has failed by the measurements he set. You won't hear that at this convention, but you're going to hear it at ours, I'll tell you that." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Virtually nothing the President has done, including his stimulus, which protected government but did not encourage the private sector, virtually nothing he has done has made it more likely for people to get jobs. And so, for three-and-a-half years, we've had unemployment above 8 percent. He set the measure; he has failed by the measurements he set. You won't hear that at this convention, but you're going to hear it at ours, I'll tell you that. Now, you're also not going to hear, at his convention, that he is on track to add almost as much public debt to this country as all the prior presidents combined. Even having been critical of President George W. Bush for the debt he added, which of course was far less than that which is being added by this president. You won't hear that even though he's been president for three-and-a-half years, he has yet to propose solutions to save Medicare and Social Security. You won't hear that he's the first president in modern history, in any history, to cut Medicare by $500 billion to pay for his vaunted Obamacare. You won't hear him repeat an accurate statement. I have one... I actually have one in mind in particular, which was from his speech four years ago. I mean listen to this, this is what he said four years ago, and I wish he'd repeat this, and I'm going to change one name at the end. He says ‘Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home's value plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit cards, bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of the government's making, but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of...' Yeah, Barack Obama. I changed what word he had in there and put down Barack Obama. Those things he said about the prior administration are absolutely accurate about his administration and that's why even if you like Barack Obama, we can't afford Barack Obama. It's time to get someone that'll get this economy going and put the American people back to work with good jobs and rising incomes."

Excerpt of Remarks in Lorain, Ohio

April 19, 2012

You know, the other day the President, I guess it was just yesterday, he was in Ohio and he said that this campaign is going to come down to his vision, his vision for America. If you want to know where his vision leads, open your eyes because we've been living it for the last three years. It leads to lost jobs, lost homes, lost dreams. It's time to end that vision and have a vision of growth and jobs and economic vitality." — Mitt Romney

MITT ROMNEY: "Now, as you can tell, we're in a factory. This factory is empty, it's owned by National Gypsum. It was closed in 2008, at the beginning of the economic downturn. Had the President's economic plans worked, President Obama's plans worked, it would be opened by now. But it's still empty and it underscores the failure of this president's policies with regards to getting this economy going again.

Remarks in Manchester, New Hampshire Following the Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island Primaries

April 24, 2012

Thank you Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York! And tonight I can say thank you, America. After 43 primaries and caucuses, many long days and more than a few long nights, I can say with confidence – and gratitude – that you have given me a great honor and solemn responsibility. And, together, we will win on November 6th!
We launched this campaign not far from here on a beautiful June day. It has been an extraordinary journey.
Americans have always been eternal optimists. But over the last three and a half years, we have seen hopes and dreams diminished by false promises and weak leadership. Everywhere I go, Americans are tired of being tired, and many of those who are fortunate enough to have a job are working harder for less.
For every single mom who feels heartbroken when she has to explain to her kids that she needs to take a second job … for grandparents who can't afford the gas to visit their grandchildren … for the mom and dad who never thought they'd be on food stamps … for the small business owner desperately cutting back just to keep the doors open one more month – to all of the thousands of good and decent Americans I've met who want nothing more than a better chance, a fighting chance, to all of you, I have a simple message: Hold on a little longer. A better America begins tonight.
Tonight is the start of a new campaign to unite every American who knows in their heart that we can do better! The last few years have been the best that Barack Obama can do, but it's not the best America can do!
Tonight is the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the Obama years and the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together.
This has already been a long campaign, but many Americans are just now beginning to focus on the choice before the country. In the days ahead, I look forward to spending time with many of you personally. I want to hear what's on your mind, hear about your concerns, and learn about your families. I want to know what you think we can do to make this country better…and what you expect from your next President.
And I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I'll probably start out talking about my wonderful wife Ann – I usually do – and I'll probably bore you with stories about our kids and grandkids. I'll tell you about how much I love this country, where someone like my dad, who grew up poor and never graduated from college, could pursue his dreams and work his way up to running a great car company. Only in America could a man like my dad become governor of the state in which he once sold paint from the trunk of his car.
I'd say that you might have heard that I was successful in business. And that rumor is true. But you might not have heard that I became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people to hundreds of people. You might not have heard that our business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright Horizons. And I'd tell you that not every business made it and there were good days and bad days, but every day was a lesson. And after 25 years, I know how to lead us out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery!
Four years ago Barack Obama dazzled us in front of Greek columns with sweeping promises of hope and change. But after we came down to earth, after the celebration and parades, what do we have to show for three and a half years of President Obama?
Is it easier to make ends meet? Is it easier to sell your home or buy a new one? Have you saved what you needed for retirement? Are you making more in your job? Do you have a better chance to get a better job? Do you pay less at the pump?
If the answer were "yes" to those questions, then President Obama would be running for re-election based on his achievements…and rightly so. But because he has failed, he will run a campaign of diversions, distractions, and distortions. That kind of campaign may have worked at another place and in a different time. But not here and not now. It's still about the economy …and we're not stupid.
People are hurting in America. And we know that something is wrong, terribly wrong with the direction of the country.
We know that this election is about the kind of America we will live in and the kind of America we will leave to future generations. When it comes to the character of America, President Obama and I have very different visions.
Government is at the center of his vision. It dispenses the benefits, borrows what it cannot take, and consumes a greater and greater share of the economy. With Obamacare fully installed, government will come to control half the economy, and we will have effectively ceased to be a free enterprise society.
This President is putting us on a path where our lives will be ruled by bureaucrats and boards, commissions and czars. He's asking us to accept that Washington knows best – and can provide all.
We've already seen where this path leads. It erodes freedom. It deadens the entrepreneurial spirit. And it hurts the very people it's supposed to help. Those who promise to spread the wealth around only ever succeed in spreading poverty. Other nations have chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and stagnant wages.
I have a very different vision for America, and of our future. It is an America driven by freedom, where free people, pursuing happiness in their own unique ways, create free enterprises that employ more and more Americans. Because there are so many enterprises that are succeeding, the competition for hard-working, educated and skilled employees is intense, and so wages and salaries rise.
I see an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living. I see children even more successful than their parents – some successful even beyond their wildest dreams – and others congratulating them for their achievement, not attacking them for it.
This America is fundamentally fair. We will stop the unfairness of urban children being denied access to the good schools of their choice; we will stop the unfairness of politicians giving taxpayer money to their friends' businesses; we will stop the unfairness of requiring union workers to contribute to politicians not of their choosing; we will stop the unfairness of government workers getting better pay and benefits than the taxpayers they serve; and we will stop the unfairness of one generation passing larger and larger debts on to the next.
In the America I see, character and choices matter. And education, hard work, and living within our means are valued and rewarded. And poverty will be defeated, not with a government check, but with respect and achievement that is taught by parents, learned in school, and practiced in the workplace.
This is the America that was won for us by the nation's Founders, and earned for us by the Greatest Generation. It is the America that has produced the most innovative, most productive, and the most powerful economy in the world.
As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, the graduates who can't get a job, the soldiers who return home to an unemployment line, it breaks my heart. This does not have to be. It is the result of failed leadership and of a faulty vision. We will restore the promise of America only if we restore the principles of freedom and opportunity that made America the greatest nation on earth.
Today, the hill before us is a little steep but we have always been a nation of big steppers. Many Americans have given up on this President but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America.
In the days ahead, join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the Promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger, the help wanted signs can be dusted off, and we can start again.
And this time we'll get it right. We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad.
There was a time – not so long ago – when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world.
Those days are coming back. That's our destiny.
We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans!
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Remarks in Lansing, Michigan: "A New Course for America"

May 8, 2012

Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with the students here at the Lansing Community College. East Lansing was home for my parents and me during six years of the 1960's. And though I was away at school for most of that time, it holds fond memories for me.
Much is the same as I remember it. Michigan State is still a major presence, and the capitol building continues to dominate the downtown.
But a good deal has changed, most noticeably, the demise of Oldsmobile. It was a fine car and a source of pride for the city. It was also a source of a lot of good paying jobs.
These last few years have been hard on the people of Lansing, and they have been hard on the people of America. In the Obama Economy, some of the hardest hit have been those in the middle class.
Moms and Dads who used to sit down for dinner with the kids are now working different hours, and the kids eat pretty much on their own. Retirees who had saved and planned for retirement can't sell their home, and can't begin to live off the puny interest from their CDs. Young married couples who want kids don't see how they can possibly afford to have them. For a lot of folks, things like vacations, movies and restaurants are things of the past.
I recently met with a Veterinarian and her husband. Her business has dropped 40%, not because she has lost clients, but because her clients can no longer afford to give their pets vaccinations and care. They have lost their home, and they have lost their clinic, but they have not lost their determination. They cut back, deeper and deeper, and they work, longer and harder.
Americans are tired of living on the edge. Tired of worrying about what kind of country they are leaving their children. Americans are tired of being tired.
This wasn't what we expected from President Obama. He promised change and hope, and said that he and we together could do anything.
But rhetoric met reality, and reality won. His four years in office have been a disappointment for all of us, and they have been a catastrophe for some of us.
In his campaign kickoff speech last week, he asked us not to think about these last four years. Convenient, but not convincing. Ignoring his record would bind us to repeat it.
He is asking us, nevertheless, to look only to the years ahead, to consider how much better his policies will make things down the road. But in our hearts we know. As much as we'd like to believe him, we know that America is going in the wrong direction. Not forward, but sideways, or worse. We know that the mounting debt is a problem, not a blessing. We know that failing schools mean failing futures. We know that if more and more good jobs leave America, there won't be enough good jobs to succeed in America.
This we know in our hearts--the lessons of the last four years teach us a great deal about the next years, if we continue in the same direction, with the same president.
The President's plea that we simply ignore the last four years is his latest effort to escape responsibility for the failures. His earlier effort was to attempt to blame others – his predecessor, the Congress, the One Percent, oil companies, and ATMs.
But the failures were not caused by others, they were caused by wrong choices, the President's choices.
President Obama chose to apply liberal ideas of the past to a 21st century America. Liberal policies didn't work then, they haven't worked over the last four years, and they won't work in the future. New Democrats had abandoned those policies, but President Obama resurrected them, with predictable results.
President Clinton said the era of big government was over. President Obama brought it back with a vengeance. Government at all levels now constitutes 38% of the economy, and if Obamacare is installed, it will reach almost 50%.
President Clinton made efforts to reform welfare as we knew it. President Obama is trying tirelessly to expand the welfare state to all Americans, with promises of more programs, more benefits, and more spending.
Old-school liberals saw a problem and thought a government-run program was the answer. Obamacare is the fulfillment of their dreams. Federal bureaucrats will tell all Americans what they have to have in their health insurance policies. And an unelected board will tell seniors what treatments Medicare will cover.
Liberalism once taught that unions would ensure lasting prosperity for workers. Instead, they too often contributed to disappearing companies, disappearing industries, and disappearing jobs. But like many politicians of the past, President Obama takes his marching orders from union bosses, rails against right to work states, fights to win union elections by eliminating the vote by secret ballot, and even denies an American company the right to build a factory in the American state of its choice.
The liberals of the past raised taxes, often with little thought of how they would hurt small business, and the economy. Like them, President Obama proposes to raise the tax on small business. He wants to increase the marginal tax rate paid by the most successful small businesses from 35% to 40%. It's a throwback to discredited policies, and it will kill jobs.
Old-school liberals envisioned government guiding and providing every need of every citizen. Government would be at the center, the most important player in our lives.
Have you seen President Obama's vision of the future? To help us see it, his campaign has even created a little fictional character, living an imaginary life filled with happy milestones for which she will spend the rest of her days thanking President Obama. It's called "The Life of Julia." And it is a cartoon.
Julia progresses from cradle to grave, showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible. The weak economy, high unemployment, falling wages, rising gas prices, the national debt, the insolvency of entitlements – all these are fictionally assumed away in a cartoon that is produced by a president who wants us to forget about them.
What does it say about a president's policies when he has to use a cartoon character rather than real people to justify his record? What does it say about the fiction of old liberalism to insist that good jobs and good schools and good wages will result from policies that have failed us, time and again?
It is often asked why is this recovery the slowest on record? Why are American families having to suffer so much for so long? It's because the solutions that have been applied to the problem have been the wrong solutions.
President Obama is looking in the wrong direction. Looking backward won't solve the problems of today nor will it take advantage of the opportunities of tomorrow. His are the policies of the past. The challenges of the present and the promise of tomorrow must be met by a new and bold vision for the future.
I spent my business career at the leading edge of change. For my first ten years, I helped advise enterprises across the country as the economic world changed. Some companies were able to adapt to change, and others were not. Our task was always the same – to see the impact of change and to see the future in ways that others had not.
That was also my task for the next 15 years of my life as I helped start new businesses or invested in businesses that needed to improve. We saw the immense opportunity for advertising on the Internet, the opportunity for super-stores in sporting goods and in office supplies, the opportunity for building a new steel mill even as old steel mills were shutting down.
Finding solutions and opportunities in an environment of change and turbulence is what I learned in my career. And it is something I can bring to the presidency.
This is a time for new ideas, new answers and a new direction. That is the only way that our future can be better than the past.
Let me describe some of the policies of that new direction. I will be discussing these throughout this campaign.
I will improve healthcare by getting it to work more like a consumer market, and I will repeal and replace Obamacare. Individuals will be able to buy their own health insurance policies, either through their employer or directly. And the kind of competition we see in everything from auto insurance to cell phones to broadband will finally slow the growth of healthcare costs.
I will improve schools and universities and colleges with greater choice, greater accountability, and greater application of the technologies that have transformed so much of our economy.
I will help usher in a revival in American manufacturing. If we take an entirely new and different direction in energy, in trade, and in labor policies, we will see more manufacturing jobs come back to America than those that are leaving America. I am absolutely convinced that with the right policies and leadership we can see a resurgence in American manufacturing.
New and emerging small businesses and so-called gazelle, or fast-growing, businesses will spring up across the country by instituting pro-growth regulations, pro-growth taxes, pro-growth intellectual property protections, and pro-growth labor policies.
We will re-build our failing infrastructure by merging public investment with private initiative.
And as this new direction creates new jobs, it will also create the increasing demand for workers that will produce higher wages and better benefits.
With the right direction and the right leadership, America can be reinvigorated as an economic powerhouse. And families can depend on stable jobs, rising home values, and more opportunity for their children. This can be more than our hope – it can be our future.
The economic pressures that families feel today are not inevitable. It does not have to be this way. We are not the victims of forces beyond our control. We can choose our destiny. We are, after all, Americans.
America is at a crossroads, one with the greatest economic divergence of the last hundred years. One path is that which President Obama has chosen. It ends with us becoming like much of Europe with chronic high unemployment, stagnant wages, and perilous levels of debt. If we continue in this direction, companies will continue to migrate away from America to job-friendly countries. Small businesses and start-ups will dwindle. And consumed by a desire to protect what little we have left, we will ignore the kinds of opportunities that created this great nation in the first place.
I propose a different course, a new course unlike any of our past. It will draw on the creativity and invention of the world's most innovative citizenry. Government will be their partner, not their master. And government will be small enough for businesses to grow fast enough – fast enough to exploit the global opportunities in our changing world, fast enough to create better jobs, fast enough to provide our children with a future brighter than our past.
The President is trying to breathe life into the failed policies of the past. We must instead invigorate the spirit of free people and free enterprises with a new vision for the future.
I am increasingly optimistic about our future. I know the challenges we face as a nation are serious and grave. But while I understand our challenges, I've also seen our strengths.
In this campaign, I've seen the fundamental goodness of our nation and of our people.
I've seen the creative capacity of our entrepreneurs, the productivity of our workers, the unrivaled power of freedom.
In our students, I've seen the leaders and innovators of tomorrow. They will do great things if we give them the freedom to dream big and the resources to create and build upon those dreams.
Innovation is the heart and soul of American prosperity. We work on iPads, we take pictures with cell phones, we sell on virtual marketplaces, we have best friends on Facebook we have never met--all of these things were invented in America. And somewhere at a coffee shop, perhaps here in Lansing, a student is probably sketching out an idea that will change our lives in ways we can't imagine. I want that person to succeed beyond their wildest dreams. I want them to create thousands of new jobs. And out of their innovation will come other innovations, and more good jobs. This is how America works.
At a time when technology is empowering people with more choices and more control over their lives than at any other time in history, this President's policies substitute government for individuality, for choice, for freedom. There is no app for freedom. It is what we live. Freedom gives us more choices, more prosperity, and better lives.
We do not have to live with less. We can create more.
This is America. I believe in America. I believe in the power of freedom to create a better future.
Our children are counting on us. The world depends on us. And God willing, we will not disappoint them.
God bless this great nation.

Commencement Address At Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia

May 12, 2012

For the graduates, this moment marks a clear ending and a clear beginning. The task set before you four years ago is now completed in full. To the class of 2012: Well done, and congratulations.
Some of you may have taken a little longer than four years to complete your studies. One graduate has said that he completed his degree in only two terms: Clinton's and Bush's.
In some ways, it is fitting that I share this distinction with Truett Cathy. The Romney campaign comes to a sudden stop when we spot a Chick-fil-A. Your chicken sandwiches were our comfort food through the primary season, and there were days that we needed a lot of comforting. So, Truett, thank you and congratulations on your well-deserved honor today.
There are some people here who are even more pleased than the graduates. Those would be the parents. Their years of prayers, devotion, and investment have added up to this joyful achievement. And with credit to Congressman Dick Armey: The American Dream is not owning your own home, it is getting your kids out of the home you own.
Lately, I've found myself thinking about life in four-year stretches. And let's just say that not everybody has achieved as much in these last four years as you have.
That's a theme for another day. But two observations. First, even though job opportunities are scarce in this economy, it is not for nothing that you have spent this time preparing. Jerry Falwell, Senior, long ago observed that "You do not determine a man's greatness by his talent or wealth, as the world does, but rather by what it takes to discourage him." America needs your skill and talent. If we take the right course, we will see a resurgence in the American economy that will surprise the world, and that will open new doors of opportunity for those who are prepared as you are.
Of course, what the next four years might hold for me is yet to be determined. But I will say that things are looking up, and I take your kind hospitality today as a sign of good things to come.
I consider it a great life honor to address you today. Your generosity of spirit humbles me. The welcoming spirit of Liberty is a tribute to the gracious Christian example of your founder.
In his 73 years of life, Dr. Falwell left a big mark. For nearly five decades he shared that walk with his good wife Macel. It's wonderful to see her today. The calling Jerry answered was not an easy one. Today we remember him as a courageous and big-hearted minister of the Gospel who never feared an argument, and never hated an adversary. Jerry deserves the tribute he would have treasured most, as a cheerful, confident champion for Christ.
I will always remember his cheerful good humor and selflessness. Several years ago, in my home, my wife and I were posing for a picture together with him. We wanted him to be in the center of the photo, but he insisted that Ann be in the middle, with he and I on the sides. He explained, by pointing to me and himself, "You see, Christ died between two thieves."
Maybe the most confident step Jerry ever took was to open the doors of this school 41 years ago.
He believed that Liberty might become one of the most respected Christian universities anywhere on earth. And so it is today.
He believed, even when the first graduating class consisted of 13 students, that year after year young Christians would be drawn to such a university in ever-greater numbers. And here you are.
Today, thanks to what you have gained here, you leave Liberty with conviction and confidence as your armor. You know what you believe. You know who you are. And you know Whom you will serve. Not all colleges instill that kind of confidence, but it will be among the most prized qualities from your education here. Moral certainty, clear standards, and a commitment to spiritual ideals will set you apart in a world that searches for meaning.
That said, your values will not always be the object of public admiration. In fact, the more you live by your beliefs, the more you will endure the censure of the world. Christianity is not the faith of the complacent, the comfortable or of the timid. It demands and creates heroic souls like Wesley, Wilberforce, Bonhoeffer, John Paul the Second, and Billy Graham. Each showed, in their own way, the relentless and powerful influence of the message of Jesus Christ. May that be your guide.
You enter a world with civilizations and economies that are far from equal. Harvard historian David Landes devoted his lifelong study to understanding why some civilizations rise, and why others falter. His conclusion: Culture makes all the difference. Not natural resources, not geography, but what people believe and value. Central to America's rise to global leadership is our Judeo-Christian tradition, with its vision of the goodness and possibilities of every life.
The American culture promotes personal responsibility, the dignity of work, the value of education, the merit of service, devotion to a purpose greater than self, and, at the foundation, the pre-eminence of the family.
The power of these values is evidenced by a Brookings Institution study that Senator Rick Santorum brought to my attention. For those who graduate from high school, get a full-time job, and marry before they have their first child, the probability that they will be poor is 2%. But, if those things are absent, 76% will be poor. Culture matters.
As fundamental as these principles are, they may become topics of democratic debate. So it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman.
The protection of religious freedom has also become a matter of debate. It strikes me as odd that the free exercise of religious faith is sometimes treated as a problem, something America is stuck with instead of blessed with. Perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government.
But from the beginning, this nation trusted in God, not man. Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution. And whether the cause is justice for the persecuted, compassion for the needy and the sick, or mercy for the child waiting to be born, there is no greater force for good in the nation than Christian conscience in action.
Religious freedom opens a door for Americans that is closed to too many others around the world. But whether we walk through that door, and what we do with our lives after we do, is up to us.
Someone once observed that the great drama of Christianity is not a crowd shot, following the movements of collectives or even nations. The drama is always personal, individual, unfolding in one's own life. We're not alone in sensing this. Men and women of every faith, and good people with none at all, sincerely strive to do right and lead a purpose-driven life.
And, in the way of lessons learned, by hitting the mark or by falling short, I can tell you this much for sure.
All that you have heard here at Liberty University – about trusting in God and in His purpose for each of us--makes for more than a good sermon. It makes for a good life. So many things compete for our attention and devotion. That doesn't stop as you get older. We are all prone, at various turns, to treat the trivial things as all-important, the all-important things as trivial, and little by little lose sight of the one thing that endures forever.
No person I have ever met, not even the most righteous or pure of heart, has gone without those times when faith recedes in the busy-ness of life. It's normal, and sometimes even the smallest glimpses of the Lord's work in our lives can reawaken our hearts. They bring us back to ourselves – and, better still, to something far greater than ourselves.
What we have, what we wish we had – ambitions fulfilled, ambitions disappointed ... investments won, investments lost ... elections won, elections lost – these things may occupy our attention, but they do not define us. And each of them is subject to the vagaries and serendipities of life. Our relationship with our Maker, however, depends on none of this. It is entirely in our control, for He is always at the door, and knocks for us. Our worldly successes cannot be guaranteed, but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us, thanks to the grace of God. The best advice I know is to give those worldly things your best but never your all, reserving the ultimate hope for the only one who can grant it.
Many a preacher has advised the same, but few as memorably as Martin Luther King, Jr. "As a young man," he said, "with most of my life ahead of me, I decided early to give my life to something eternal and absolute. Not to these little gods that are here today and gone tomorrow. But to God who is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
In this life, the commitments that come closest to forever are those of family.
My Dad, George Romney, was a CEO, a governor, and a member of the President's Cabinet. My wife Ann asked him once, "What was your greatest accomplishment?" Without a moment's pause, he said, "Raising our four kids."
Ann and I feel the same way about our family. I have never once regretted missing a business opportunity so that I could be with my children and grandchildren. Among the things in life that can be put off, being there when it matters most isn't one of them.
As C.S. Lewis is said to have remarked, "The home is the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose, and that is to support the ultimate career."
Promotions often mark the high points in a career, and I hope I haven't seen my last. But sometimes the high points come in unexpected ways. I was asked to help rescue the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
I'm embarrassed now to recall that when this opportunity was first presented to me, I dismissed it out of hand. I was busy, I was doing well, and, by the way, my lack of athletic prowess did not make the Olympics a logical step. In fact, after I had accepted the position, my oldest son called me and said, "Dad, I've spoken to the brothers. We saw the paper this morning. We want you to know there's not a circumstance we could have conceived of that would put you on the front page of the sports section."
The Olympics were not a logical choice, but it was one of the best and most fulfilling choices of my life. Opportunities for you to serve in meaningful ways may come at inconvenient times, but that will make them all the more precious.
People of different faiths, like yours and mine, sometimes wonder where we can meet in common purpose, when there are so many differences in creed and theology. Surely the answer is that we can meet in service, in shared moral convictions about our nation stemming from a common worldview. The best case for this is always the example of Christian men and women working and witnessing to carry God's love into every life – people like the late Chuck Colson.
Not long ago, Chuck recounted a story from his days just after leaving prison. He was assured by people of influence that, even with a prison record, a man with his connections and experience could still live very comfortably. They would make some calls, get Chuck situated, and set him up once again as an important man. His choice at that crossroads would make him, instead, a great man.
The call to service is one of the fundamental elements of our national character. It has motivated every great movement of conscience that this hopeful, fair-minded country of ours has ever seen. Sometimes, as Dr. Viktor Frankl observed in a book for the ages, it is not a matter of what we are asking of life, but rather what life is asking of us. How often the answer to our own troubles is to help others with theirs.
In all of these things – faith, family, work, and service –the choices we make as Americans are, in other places, not choices at all. For so many on this earth, life is filled with orders, not options, right down to where they live, the work they do, and how many children the state will permit them to have. All the more reason to be grateful, this and every day, that we live in America, where the talents God gave us may be used in freedom.
At this great Christian institution, you have all learned a thing or two about these gifts and the good purposes they can serve. They are yours to have and yours to share. Sometimes, your Liberty education will set you apart, and always it will help direct your path. And as you now leave, and make for new places near and far, I hope for each one of you that your path will be long and life will be kind.
The ideals that brought you here ... the wisdom you gained here ... and the friends you found here – may these blessings be with you always, wherever you go.
Thank you all, and God bless you.

Remarks In Des Moines, Iowa

May 15, 2012

Thank you all very much.
It's good to be back in Iowa. So many friends here hold a special place in my heart.
I've come here today to talk to you about an issue that affects the very heart of America.
Of course, Iowa is much more than a collection of beautiful farms and small towns and cities bounded by two of America's great rivers. Iowa is a collection of the values that built America and that have sustained us through good times and bad. You know them well: hard work, taking care of our neighbors, family, faith in God and country. Common sense, kitchen table values. Not fancy, but enduring.
These aren't the values that lead to out-of-control spending sprees, or to piling up massive amounts of debt you know your children – and grandchildren – will have to work all their lives to pay off. These aren't the values of putting off difficult decisions with the hope that maybe someone else will solve them.
Today America faces a financial crisis of debt and spending that threatens what it means to be an American. Here in the heartland you know in your hearts that it's wrong.
We can't spend another four years talking about solving a problem that we know we are making worse every single day.
When the men and women who settled the Iowa prairie saw a fire in the distance, they didn't look around for someone else to save them or go back to sleep hoping the wind might blow another direction. They knew that their survival was up to them.
A prairie fire of debt is sweeping across Iowa and our nation and every day we fail to act that fire gets closer to the homes and children we love.
This is not solely a Democrat or a Republican problem. The issue isn't who deserves the most blame, it's who is going to do what it takes to put out the fire.
The people of Iowa and America have watched President Obama for nearly four years, much of that time with Congress controlled by his own party. And rather than put out the spending fire, he has fed the fire. He has spent more and borrowed more.
The time has come for a president, a leader, who will lead. I will lead us out of this debt and spending inferno. We will stop borrowing unfathomable sums of money we can't even imagine, from foreign countries we'll never even visit. I will bring us together to put out the fire!
A lot of people think this is a problem we can't solve. I reject that kind of "can't do" defeatist talk. It's wrong.
What's happened here isn't complicated. Washington has been spending too much money and our new President made things much worse. His policies have taken us backwards.
Almost a generation ago, Bill Clinton announced that the Era of Big Government was over.
Even a former McGovern campaign worker like President Clinton was signaling to his own Party that Democrats should no longer try to govern by proposing a new program for every problem.
President Obama tucked away the Clinton doctrine in his large drawer of discarded ideas, along with transparency and bipartisanship. It's enough to make you wonder if maybe it was a personal beef with the Clintons....but really it runs much deeper.
President Obama is an old school liberal whose first instinct is to see free enterprise as the villain and government as the hero. America counted on President Obama to rescue the economy, tame the deficit and help create jobs. Instead, he bailed out the public-sector, gave billions of dollars to the companies of his friends, and added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined.
The consequence is that we are enduring the most tepid recovery in modern history.
The consequence is that half of the kids graduating from college can't find a job that uses their skills. Half.
The consequence is that retirees can no longer get by on savings and Social Security.
The consequence is that the length of time it takes an unemployed worker to find a job is the longest on record.
This is why even those who voted for Barack Obama are disappointed in him.
Disappointment is the key in which the President's re-election is being played. Americans will not settle for four more years of the same melancholy song. We can and we must do better.
President Obama started out with a near trillion-dollar stimulus package – the biggest, most careless one-time expenditure by the federal government in history. And remember this: the stimulus wasn't just wasted – it was borrowed and wasted. We still owe the money, we're still paying interest on it, and it'll be that way long after this presidency ends.
Then there was Obamacare. Even now nobody knows what it will actually cost. And that uncertainty has slowed our economy. Employers delay hiring and entrepreneurs put the brakes on starting new businesses, because of a massive, European-style entitlement that Americans didn't want and can't afford.
When you add up his policies, this President has increased the national debt by five trillion dollars.
Let me put that in a way we can understand. Your household's share of government debt and unfunded liabilities has reached more than $520,000 under this president. Think about what that means. Your household will be taxed year after year with the interest cost of that debt and with the principal payments for those liabilities. Of course, it won't be paid off by the adults in your household. It will be passed along to your children. They will struggle throughout their lives with the interest on our debts--and President Obama is adding to them every single day.
And that's the best case scenario. The interest rate on that debt is bound to go up, like an adjustable mortgage. And there's a good chance this debt could cause us to hit a Greece-like wall.
Subprime mortgages came close to bringing the economy to its knees. This debt is America's Nightmare Mortgage. It is adjustable, no-money down, and assigned to our children. Politicians have been trying to hide the truth about this Nightmare Mortgage for years--just like liar-loans.
This is not just bad economics; it is immoral.
During my time in business and in state government, I came to see the economy as having three big players – the private sector, the states and localities, and the federal government.
Of these three, the private sector is by far the most efficient and cost effective. That's because scores of businesses and thousands of entrepreneurs are competing every day to find a way to deliver a product or a service that is better than anyone else's. Think about smart phones. Blackberry got things going. Then Apple introduced the iPhone. Now the Android platform leads the market. In the world of free enterprise, competition brings us better and better products at lower and lower cost. Innovate and change or you go out of business. And the customer--us--benefits.
Government doesn't begin to compare when it comes to change and improvements that provide better and less expensive services and products. But among governments, the states and localities are more responsive than the federal government, probably because there is a degree of competition between them.
The slowest, least responsive sector is the federal government. Nobody hears "Washington, D.C." and thinks "efficiency."
Imagine if the federal government was the sole legal supplier of cell phones. First, they'd still be under review, with hearings in Congress. When finally approved, the contract to make them would go to an Obama donor. They'd be the size of a shoe, with a collapsible solar panel. And campaign donors would be competing to become the all-powerful App Czar.
My point is this: as President Obama and old-school liberals absorb more and more of our economy into government, they make what we do more expensive, less efficient, and less useful. They make America less competitive. They make government more expensive.
What President Obama is doing is not bold; it's old.
As president, I will make the federal government simpler, smaller, smarter – and, by the way, more in keeping with the vision of the Framers of our Constitution.
This is why I do not, for one moment, share my opponent's belief that our spending problems can be solved with more taxes. You do not owe Washington a bigger share of your paycheck.
Instead of putting more limits on your earnings and your options, we need to place clear and firm limits on government spending. As a start, I will lower federal spending to 20 percent of GDP within four years' time – down from the 24.3 percent today.
The President's plan assumes an endless expansion of government, with costs rising and rising with the spread of Obamacare. I will halt the expansion of government, and repeal Obamacare.
Working together, we can save Social Security without making any changes in the system for people in or nearing retirement. We have two basic options for future retirees: a tax increase for high-income retirees, or a decrease in the benefit growth rate for high-income retirees. I favor the second option; it protects everyone in the system and it avoids higher taxes that will drag down the economy.
I have proposed a Medicare plan that improves the program, keeps it solvent, and slows the rate of growth in health care costs.
Both of these reforms are relatively simple, compared to the far more difficult choices we'll face if we do nothing. Of course, Medicare and Social Security are also easy to demagogue, and I expect the President to continue doing that in this campaign. But Americans are on to that game, and I'm not going to insult voters by pretending that we can just keep putting off entitlement reform. I will continue to speak honestly, and, if elected, I will do what is right for the people of America.
The President has made little effort to rein in redundancy and waste.
In 2011, the Government Accountability Office found 34 areas where agencies, offices, or initiatives in the federal government had overlapping objectives or were providing similar services. The GAO estimated that fixing this redundancy could save over $100 billion. Yet, one year later, only three of these 34 areas had been fully addressed. Only one program was actually defunded.
In 2010, 17 federal government agencies gave $7.7 billion to more than 25 United Nations programs, billions of it voluntarily.
Another example: There are 94 federal programs in 11 agencies that encourage "green" building. A report found that the results of their initiatives and investments are, quote, "unknown."
We see the same bureaucracy and overhead in our anti-poverty programs. Last year, the federal government spent more than $600 billion on more than 100 different programs that aim to help the poor.
My approach to federal programs and bureaucracy is entirely different. Move programs to states or to the private sector where they can be run more efficiently and where we can do a better job helping the people who need our help. Shut down programs that aren't working. And streamline everything that's left. It's time for the people of America to take back the government of America.
Entitlement reform, doing away with redundancy and waste, and shifting services and programs to the economic player who can deliver them best – these are all serious steps toward getting our debt and spending under control.
But above all, we need to shake off the static big-government mindset of these past few years, and all the limits and regulations that go with it. We need a big turnaround here, and it requires a focused, unrelenting, long-term agenda for economic growth.
Instead of leading the world in how much we borrow, America must continue to lead the world in how much we build, create, and invent.
With all that we've been through these past few years, the challenges can seem awfully big, and some might look at America and wonder if we have lost our confidence. But confidence is not what is missing. All that's lacking now is direction and leadership.
These have been years of disappointment and decline, and soon we can put them behind us. We can prosper again, with the powerful recovery we've all been waiting for, the good jobs that so many still need, and, above all, the opportunities we owe to our children and grandchildren.
All of this can be more than our hope – it can be our future. It can begin this year, in the choice you make, so I ask for your help, your support, and your vote on the sixth of November.
Thank you all, and God bless America.

Remarks at a Fundraising Event in Boca Raton, Florida

May 17, 2012

[video provided by "Mother Jones"]
Part I:
Part II:
ROMNEY: ...And I guess everybody here is a dignitary, and I appreciate your help. And by the way, I am serious about the food. Bring that...clear the place, but Hilary has to eat her beets. [laughter] I'm gonna—because the table is small enough and the room is intimate enough, I'd like to spend our time responding to questions you have, listening to advice you might have. Occasionally, as I did just a moment ago, I get envelopes like that, which is, and I'll open this and there'll be campaign ideas—"Why don't you talk about the following issues..."—so I'm happy to take advice and then we can all vote on it, whether it's a good piece of advice or bad advice. And so we'll get a chance to do that, but I'm looking to get your perspectives. Just to tell you a couple of things you may not know about me. You probably know that I'm father of five and grandfather now of 18—my oldest son just had twins just last week, and so our grandchild nest is getting larger, and they're a source of great joy. When I was probably halfway through my career at Bain Consulting, I met with a lawyer to draft a will, and she said, "How do you want to divide what estate you might eventually have?" And I said—I didn't have anything at that point—I said, "I want to divide it equally among my five sons." And she said, "Well, how much will you want to give to the grandchildren that they will ultimately have," and I said, "Well, I don't want to give anything to the grandchildren—I'll give it to the sons, and they in turn will give it to their children as needed." And she said, "You'll change your mind." And I said, "No, I don't think so." So I saw her not long ago, and I said, "I don't want to give anything to my sons, I want to give it [to all to my grandchildren.] [laughter]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You lost Samantha's vote. [laughter]
ROMNEY: This, uh, it's not as...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is my daughter. [laughter]
ROMNEY: It's not just because I love my grandchildren, as I do, and I love my sons and [unintelligible], it's that I'm very concerned about what the nation is gonna be like over the coming decade or two. And I really do. As I said in my remarks earlier, I see these two very different scenarios. One is as America really powering the world economy, with an extraordinary economy here, with China working with us, wanting to see stability in the world, and a very vibrant America, with freedom and prosperity for the great bulk of the American people. On the other hand, I really do see something like Europe. And I think that's the path we're on right now. So that's why I wanna make sure what little I'll have left after the campaigns goes to you know, goes to my grandchildren. That's one piece about me that you may not know. The other is just about my heritage—my dad, you probably know, was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company, but he was born in Mexico. And had he been born of Mexican parents I'd have a better shot at winning this, but he was [laughter] unfortunately born of Americans living in Mexico. They'd lived there for a number of years, and, uh, I mean I say that jokingly, but it'd be helpful if they'd been Latino...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Pull an Elizabeth Warren!
ROMNEY: Pardon?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Pull an Elizabeth Warren.
ROMNEY: That's right. Those that don't know Elizabeth Warren—she's the woman who's running for US Senate in Massachusetts, who said that she's Cherokee, has put in her application over the years that she's Cherokee, and Harvard put down that she's one of their minority faculty members. It turns out that at most she's 1/32 Cherokee, and even that can't be proven. So, in any event, yeah, I can put down my dad was born in Mexico and leave it at that. But his dad was in construction, very successful in Mexico, but in America went broke more than once. So my dad never had the money or time to get a college degree. Without a college degree, became head of a big car company and ultimately a governor. And believed in America, believed in the opportunity in this country, never doubted for a moment that he could achieve his dreams. And Ann's dad, my wife's dad, was born in Wales. His dad was a coal miner. This coal miner got injured in a coal mining accident; realizing that there was no future there for him or his four children, he came to Detroit and worked in the auto factories until he could save enough money to bring his kids over, which he did. And then they got together as a family and said, you know, to be successful in America, you've got to get an education. And they couldn't afford an education. And the kids and the parents said you know, if we all work, and we all save, we could afford to send one of us to college. And they, they sent my wife's dad.
Can you imagine working every day, taking a couple of jobs, saving your money so that your brother could go to—I mean, I would never do that for my brother—that he could go to co...so he went to college, and got a degree at the General Motors Institute of Technology, which is one of these programs where you work a semester, and then you go to school a semester and...and then after it was over he started a little company, he became more successful, and he was able to hire his brothers and his brother-in-law, and provide for them in an extraordinary way. By the way, both my dad and Ann's dad did quite well in their life, but when they came to the end of their lives, and, and passed along inheritances to Ann and to me, we both decided to give it all away. So, I had inherited nothing. Everything that Ann and I have we earned the old-fashioned way, and that's by hard work and...[applause] I see that—
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You've just lost Samantha's vote for a second time. [laughter]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: These jokes are [unintelligible]. [laughter]
ROMNEY: I say that because there's the percent that's, "Oh, you were born with a silver spoon," you know, "You never had to earn anything," and so forth. And, and frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you could have, which is to get born in America. I'll tell ya, there is—95 percent of life is set up for you if you're born in this country. And I remember going to—sorry just to bore you with stories—but I was, when I was back in my private equity days, we went to China to buy a factory there, employed about 20,000 people, and they were almost all young women between the ages of about 18 and 22 or 23. They were saving for potentially becoming married, and they worked in these huge factories, they made various small appliances, and as we were walking through this facility, seeing them work, the number of hours they worked per day, the pittance they earned, living in dormitories with little bathrooms at the end with maybe ten rooms. And the rooms, they had 12 girls per room, three bunk beds on top of each other. You've seen them.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, yeah.
ROMNEY: And around this factory was a fence, a huge fence with barbed wire, and guard towers. And we said, "Gosh, I can't believe that you, you know, you keep these girls in." They said, "No, no, no—this is to keep other people from coming in. Because people want so badly to come work in this factory that we have to keep them out, or they'll just come in here and start working and try and get compensated. So, we—this is to keep people out." And they said, "Actually, Chinese New Year, is the girls go home, sometimes they decide they've saved enough money and they don't come back to the factory." And he said, "And so on the weekend after Chinese New Year, there'll be a line of people hundreds long outside the factory, hoping that some girls haven't come back and they can come to the factory. And so, as we were experiencing this for the first time, for me to see a factory like this in China some years ago, the Bain partner I was with turned to me and said, "You know, 95 percent of life is settled if you're born in America." This is an amazing land. And what we have is unique, and fortunately it is so special we're sharing it with the world. I'm concerned about the future, but also optimistic as I said, and I look forward to getting America back on track, and having people plan on bringing their ideas and their dreams to this country. We get big dreamers, by the way. Oh, I just, we didn't talk about immigration today. Gosh, I'd love to bring in more legal immigrants that have skill and [unintelligible]. I'd like to staple a green card to every Ph.D. in the world and say, "Come to America, we want you here." Instead, we make it hard for people who get educated here or elsewhere to make this their home. Unless, of course, you have no skill or experience, in which case you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life. [laughter] It's very strange. It's run by people who don't understand the words "global competition of ideas," and our idea has to win, but only if America reigns strong. But with that introduction, I'm going to turn to you for counsel, advice, or questions. Policy questions. Wanna talk about tax policy? Or political questions? How I win? Please.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: One comment, Governor.
ROMNEY: Yes.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The debates are gonna be coming, and I hope at the right moment you can turn to President Obama, look at the American people, and say, "If you vote to reelect President Obama, you're voting to bankrupt the United States." I hope you keep that in your quiver because that's what gonna happen. And I think it's going to be very effective. Just wanted to give you that.
ROMNEY: Yeah, it's interesting...the former head of Goldman Sachs, John Whitehead, was also the former head of the New York Federal Reserve. And I met with him, and he said as soon as the Fed stops buying all the debt that we're issuing—which they've been doing, the Fed's buying like three-quarters of the debt that America issues. He said, once that's over, he said we're going to have a failed Treasury auction, interest rates are going to have to go up. We're living in this borrowed fantasy world, where the government keeps on borrowing money. You know, we borrow this extra trillion a year, we wonder who's loaning us the trillion? The Chinese aren't loaning us anymore. The Russians aren't loaning it to us anymore. So who's giving us the trillion? And the answer is we're just making it up. The Federal Reserve is just taking it and saying, "Here, we're giving it.' It's just made up money, and this does not augur well for our economic future.
You know, some of these things are complex enough it's not easy for people to understand, but your point of saying, bankruptcy usually concentrates the mind. Yeah, George.
Audience member, "George": Governor, to your point on complexity. How is—you've traveled around America and talked to people in larger groups and perhaps people with different backgrounds, and people in this room: To what extent do people really understand that we're hurtling toward a cliff, and to what extent do people understand the severity of the fiscal situation we're in. Do people get it?
ROMNEY: They don't. By and large people don't get it. People in our party, and part of—it's our fault because we've been talking about deficits and debt for about 25 or 30 years as a party, and so they've heard us say it and say it and say it. The fact that Greece is going what it's going through, and they read about France and Italy and Spain, has finally made this issue topical for the American people. And so when you do polls, and you ask people what is the biggest issue in the 2012 election, No. 1 is the economy and jobs by a wide margin. But No. 2 is the deficit. But debt, that doesn't calculate for folks, but the deficit does. They recognize you can't go on forever like this. Although the people who recognize that tend to be Republicans, and the people who don't recognize that tend to be Democrats. And what we have to get is that 5 or 10 percent in the middle who sometimes vote Republican, sometimes vote Democrat, and have them understand how important this is. It's a challenge. I did the calculation for folks today, and USA Today publishes this every year. It's a front-page story: the headline once a year, it somehow escapes people's attention, and that is, if you take the total national debt and the unfunded liabilities of Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, the amount of debt plus unfunded liabilities per household in America is $520,000. Per household.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's like 12 times their income, right?
ROMNEY: At least. 10, 12 times their income. Even though we're not going to be writing the check for that amount per household, they're going to be paying the interest on that. You'll be paying the interest on that. [laughter] Because we—my generation will be long gone, and you'll be paying the interest. And so you'll be paying taxes, not only for the things you want in your generation, but for all the things we spent money on, which is just—it's extraordinary to think the tax rates, someone calculated what would happen. If we don't change Medicare or Social Security, the tax rate—you know what the payroll tax is now, it's 15.3 percent—if we don't change those programs, that tax rate will have to ultimately rise to 44 percent. The payroll tax. Then there's the income tax on top, which the president wants to take to 40 percent. Then there's state tax in most states. And sales tax. So you end up having to take 100 percent of people's income. And yet the president, three and a half years in, won't talk about reforming Social Security or Medicare. And when the Republicans do, it's "Oh, you're throwing granny off the cliff." It's like you're killing the kids. The biggest surprise that I have is that young people will vote for Democrats. They look at this and say, "Holy cow! The only guys who are worried about the future of our country and our future are Republicans." But the Democrats, they talk about social issues, draw in the young people, and they vote on that issue. It's like, I mean, there won't be any houses like this if we stay on the road we're on.
Please. Yeah—I heard a voice, please.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Gov. Romney, we are former Bostonians, and we'll talk about how we know you.
ROMNEY: Uh, oh. [audience laughter and cross talk]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's good!...and we totally agree with what you said economically. But I would like to know, and I would like to get into much more discussion on what I consider the real issues: the real issues of Iran, and how your point of view differs from President Obama's.
ROMNEY: Thank you—and by the way, start eating, those of you who have food in front of you that's warm, start eating. I'm standing up so I can see you, but I'm not standing up so you that you have to stop and look at me. It's important to look at your food as you're eating it. [laughter] Noticed you putting a fork in your finger here, all right...[cross talk and laughter].
You are right, which is a nuclear Iran is an unthinkable outcome, not just for our friends in Israel and our friends in Europe, but also for us. Because Iran is the state sponsor of terror in the world, has Hezbollah now throughout Latin America, Hezbollah with fissile material. If I were Iran, and a crazed fanatic, I'd say let's get a little fissile material to Hezbollah, have them carry it to Chicago or some other place, and then if anything goes wrong or if America starts acting up, we'll just say, "Guess what, unless you stand down, why we're gonna let off a dirty bomb." This is where we head, where American can be held up and blackmailed by Iran, by the mullahs, by crazy people. So we really don't have any option but to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon.
I'll give the specifics about Iran, and then maybe talk more broadly about foreign policy. The specific on Iran is that we should have put in place crippling sanctions at the beginning of the president's term. We did not. He will say, "Yes, but Russian wouldn't go along with us." Well, he gave Russia their No. 1 foreign objective: For a decade, all they've cared about is getting the missile defense sites out of Poland, and he gave them that and got nothing in return. He could have—I presume—gotten them to agree to crippling sanctions on Iran. He did not, which is in my opinion, one of the greatest foreign policy errors of the modern time. And by the way, if he could not have gotten that from Russia, he should have kept the missile defense sites in Poland, just to keep a bargaining chip on table. I mean, put nothing in if he wants—I would have kept them, I wouldn't have traded them away, but that's where he was.
No. 2, we should have been aggressively supporting the voices of dissent in Iran, and when there was an effort towards revolution there we should been aggressively supporting. And finally we should have made it clear, at least by now, that we have military plans to potentially remove their nuclear capabilities. That doesn't mean we actually pull the trigger, but it means we communicate to them that we're ready to do so. And that it is unacceptable to America to have a nuclear Iran. Instead what this administration has done is communicate to the Iranians that we're more worried about Israel attacking them than we are about them becoming nuclear. It's extraordinary. So those are some thoughts directly at Iran.
I'll step back on foreign policy: The president's foreign policy, in my opinion, is formed in part by a perception that he has that his magnetism and his charm and his persuasiveness is so compelling that he can sit down with people like Putin, Chбvez, and Ahmadinejad. And that they'll find we're such wonderful people that they'll go on with us. And they'll stop doing bad things. And it's an extraordinarily naive perception, and it has led to huge errors in North Korea, in Iraq, obviously in Iran, in Egypt, around the world. My own view is that that the centerpiece of American foreign policy has to be strength. Everything I do will be calculated to increasing America's strength. When you stand by your allies, you increase your strength. When you attack your allies, you become weaker. When you stand by your principles, you get stronger. When you have a big military—that's bigger than anyone else's—you're stronger. [unintelligible] When you have a strong economy, you build America's strength. For me, everything is about strength and communicating to people what is and is not acceptable. It's speaking softly but carrying a very, very, very big stick. And this president instead speaks loudly and carries a tiny stick. And that is, you know, that's not the right course for a foreign policy. I saw Dr. Kissinger in New York—you're not eating! [laughter]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm mesmerized! [unintelligible]
ROMNEY: He's bored to tears. [laughter] I saw Dr. Kissinger; I said to him, "How are we perceived around the world?" And he said, "One word: VEAK!" [laughter] We are weak, and that's how this president is perceived, by our friends and, unfortunately, by our foes. And it's no wonder that people like Kim Jong Un, the new leader of North Korea, announces a long-range missile test only a week after he said he wouldn't. Because, it's like, what's this president going to do about it? If you can't act, why, don't threaten. [To another audience member with a question] Please.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [Asks about Iraq (Garbled)]
ROMNEY: I'm just gonna taste this by the way. I just wanna show you how it's done: You take this in your fork...[laughter]...you put it in...That's good, that's good. Please, go ahead.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you get the call as president, and you had hostages...Ronald Reagan was able to make a statement, even before he became, was actually sworn in—
ROMNEY: Yeah—
AUDIENCE MEMBER: the hostages were released—
ROMNEY: on the day of his inauguration, yeah.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So my question is, really, how can you sort of duplicate that scenario?
ROMNEY: Ohhhh. [A few chuckles in audience] I'm gonna ask you, how do I duplicate that scenario.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I think that had to do with the fact that the Iranians perceived Reagan would do something to really get them out. In other words [unintelligible]...and that's why I'm suggesting that something that you say over the next few months gets the Iranians to understand that their pursuit of the bomb is something that you would predict and I think that's something that could possibly resonate very well with American Republican voters.
ROMNEY: I appreciate the idea. I can't—one of the other things that's frustrating to me is that at a typical day like this, when I do three or four events like this, the number of foreign policy questions that I get are between zero and one. And the American people are not concentrated at all on China, on Russia, Iran, Iraq. This president's failure to put in place a status forces agreement allowing 10-20,000 troops to stay in Iraq? Unthinkable! And yet, in that election, in the Jimmy Carter election, the fact that we have hostages in Iran, I mean, that was all we talked about. And we had the two helicopters crash in the desert, I mean that's—that was—that was the focus, and so him solving that made all the difference in the world. I'm afraid today if you said, "We got Iran to agree to stand down a nuclear weapon," they'd go hold on. It's really a, but...by the way, if something of that nature presents itself, I will work to find a way to take advantage of the opportunity.
ROMNEY: Please—yes?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's your lucky night: more foreign policy! [laughter and crosstalk]...actually the first time you were in Jerusalem. And we appreciate you being there. How do you think that the Palestinian problem can be solved, and what are you going to do about it?
ROMNEY: I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard. One is the one which I've had for some time, which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace. And that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish. Now, why do I say that? Some might say well just let the Palestinians have the West Bank and have security and set up a separate nation for the Palestinians. And then come a couple of thorny questions. And I don't have a map here to look at the geography. But the border between Israel and the West Bank is obviously right there, right next to Tel Aviv, which is the financial capital, the industrial capital of Israel. The center of Israel. It's, uh—what? The border would be maybe seven miles from Tel Aviv to what would be the West Bank?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nine.
ROMNEY: Nine miles. Okay, I'd be close. Nine miles. The challenge is the other side of the West Bank...the other side of the West Bank, the other side of what would be this new Palestinian state would either be Syria at one point or Jordan. And, of course, the Iranians would want to do through the West Bank exactly what they did through Lebanon and what they did in Gaza. Which is the Iranians would want to bring missiles and armament into the West Bank and potentially threaten Israel. So Israel, of course, would have to say that can't happen. We've got to keep the Iranians from bringing weaponry into the West Bank. Well, that means that—who?—the Israelis are going to control the border between Jordan, Syria, and this new Palestinian nation? Well, the Palestinians would say, "Ah, no way! We're an independent country. You can't guard our border with other Arab nations." And then how about the airport? How about flying into this Palestinian nation? Are we going to allow military aircraft to come in? And weaponry to come in? And if not, who's going to keep it from coming in? Well, the Israelis. Well, the Palestinians are going to say, "We're not an independent nation if Israel is able to come in and tell us what can land at our airport." These are problems, and they're very hard to solve, alright?
And I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and these thorny issues, and I say there's just no way. And so what you do is you say you move things along the best way you can. You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that it's going to remain an unsolved problem. I mean, we look at that in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a potentially volatile situation, but we sort of live with it. And we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve. We don't go to war to try and resolve it.
On the other hand, I got a call from a former secretary of state—and I won't mention which one it was—but this individual said to me, "You know, I think there's a prospect for a settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis after the Palestinian elections." I said, "Really?" And his answer was, "Yes, I think there's some prospect." And I didn't delve into it but you know, I always keep open the idea of, I have to tell ya, the idea of pushing on the Israelis?—to give something up, to get the Palestinians to act, is the worst idea in the world. We have done that time and time and time again. It does not work. So, the only answer is show your strength. Again, American strength, American resolve, as the Palestinians someday reach the point where they want peace more than we're trying to push peace on them—and then it's worth having the discussion. Until then, it's just wishful thinking.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Individuals in this room obviously are your supporters. I am very concerned that the average American, who doesn't know you, there's a terrible misconception. And I spend numerous hours trying to [unintelligible]. Years and years ago, I called George Bush Sr., and he had helped me in my campaign in Massachusetts when I ran for Senate. I told him that there's a guy named Clinton who's running for the following reasons. And he laughed. Right now, I'm very concerned...Women would not want to be involved for you. Hispanics, majority of them do not want to vote for you. College students don't. After talking to them, and explaining and rationalizing on a one-on-one basis, we are able to change their opinions. But on a mass level, what do you want us to do, this group here, as your emissaries, going out to convert these individuals to someone who's obviously going to be such an incredible asset to this country. We want you.
ROMNEY: Well...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But what do we do? Just tell us what we can help...
ROMNEY: I have—I have some good news for you. It's not impossible. Now, the reason I say that is for instance, the New York Times had a poll last week, the New York Times and NBC, and I was leading by two points among women. All right. Now, the president came out and said this is an outrageous poll, they don't know what they were doing—by the way, the polls at this stage make no difference at all—but the point is, women are open to supporting me. They like the president [unintelligible], but they're disappointed. They're disappointed with the jobs they're seeing for their kids, they're disappointed with their own economic standing right now. So we can capture women's votes, we're having a much harder time with Hispanic voters. And if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting bloc has in the past, why we're in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Rubio!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Exactly.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Pick him up!
ROMNEY: And so...[laughter] We have some great—we have some great Hispanic leaders in our party who will help communicate what our party stands for, and what I think, frankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars, because the president's going to have about $800 to $900 million. And that's—that's by far the most important thing you could do.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [unintelligible]
ROMNEY: Because, well, because you don't have the capacity to speak to hundreds of thousands of people. I will be in those debates. It will be, I don't know, 150 million Americans watching. If I do well, it'll help. If I don't, it won't help...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You will do so well. Your debates are incredible. [laughter and claps]
ROMNEY: Thank you, thanks, thank you. But advertising makes a difference, and the president will engage in a personal character assassination campaign. And so we'll have to fire back one, in defense, and No. 2, in offense. And that's [unintelligible]...Florida will be one of those states that is the key state. And so all the money will get spent in 10 states, and this is one of them. So, I—the best thing I could ask you to do—I mean, yeah, sure, talk to people and tell them how you know me and word of mouth makes a big difference. But you know, I'm not terribly well known by the general American public, because...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're known as a rich boy. I mean, they say, "He's a rich man."
ROMNEY: They don't. But don't worry—given all those negative things, given all those negative things, the fact that I'm either tied or close to the president, and the fact that, you know, he's out there talking about the one-year anniversary of Osama bin Laden being captured, unemployment coming down, unleashing his campaign, new campaign, and we're still sort of tied? That's very interesting. And it's, it's encouraging. Please.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I would disagree with that. I think a lot of young children coming out of college feel they're let down by the president. And they feel there's not a job out there for them, and [unintelligible] making $60,000 and now they're making $30,000. Very similar to the U6.
ROMNEY: Yeah, yeah.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question to you is, Why don't you stick up for yourself? To me, you should be so proud of your wealth. That's what we all aspire to be—we kill ourselves, we don't work a nine to five. We're away from our families five days a week. I'm away from my four girls five days a week and my wife. Why not stick up for yourself and say, "Why is it bad to be, to aspire to be wealthy and successful? You know, why is it bad to kill yourself? And why is it bad to cut 30 jobs that protect 300?" And, when people talk about you cutting jobs, you save companies that were failing...[unintelligible]. So my question is, when does that stand up...[unintelligible].
AUDIENCE MEMBER: ...neighborhood...and worked his way up from nothing to be an incredibly successful entrepreneur, so, it, it...
ROMNEY: You heard in my speech tonight, I talked it [crosstalk]...again, but if it...oh, you weren't here.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He came here, so he missed the...
ROMNEY: In every stump speech I give, I speak about the fact that people who dream and achieve enormous success do not make us poorer—they make us better off. And the Republican audience that I typically speak to applauds. I said that tonight, and the media's there, and they write about it, they say that Romney defends success in America and dreamers and so forth. So they write about it. But in terms of what gets through to the American consciousness, that's—I have very little influence on that in this stage, as to what they write about. And that will happen—and we'll have three debates, we'll have a chance to talk about that in the debates. There will be ads which attack me; I will fire back in a way that describes in the best way we can the fact that if, the theme in my speech is that—I wind up in, you know, the ambassadors [unintelligible] me today, several times—I wind up talking about how the thing which I find most disappointing in this president is his attack of one American against another American, the division of America based on going after those who have been successful.
And then I quote Marco Rubio, I tell in my speeches, I say, Marco Rubio—I think what I said would be [unintelligible]...I also think I said that at a fundraising event earlier today, but I did when I was in Empire...[unintelligible] [laughter]...I just said Sen. Rubio says that when he grew up here, poor, that they looked at people that had a lot of wealth, and his parents never once said, "We need some of what they have, they should give us some." Instead they said that you work hard and go to school, someday we might be able to have enough. That's...[applause] I will continue to do that, how much of that gets picked up, there are so many things that don't get picked up in a campaign because people aren't watching them. By the way, most people don't watch during the summer. I said we're going to go into a season here starting with the beginning of June with almost no attention paid, then after Labor Day, in September and October, that's when it'll get fun.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: For the last three years, all everybody's been told is, "Don't worry, we'll take care of you." How are you going to do it, in two months before the elections, to convince everybody you've got to take care of yourself?
ROMNEY: There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. And I mean, the president starts off with 48, 49, 48—he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect. And he'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean that's what they sell every four years. And so my job is not to worry about those people—I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10 percent in the center that are independents that are thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other depending upon in some cases emotion, whether they like the guy or not, what it looks like. I mean, when you ask those people...we do all these polls—I find it amazing—we poll all these people, see where you stand on the polls, but 45 percent of the people will go with a Republican, and 48 or 4...
[Recording stops]
ROMNEY: ...and about twice as much as China, not 10 times as much like it's reported. And we have responsibility for the whole world. They're only focused on one little area of the world, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, that's it. And they're building a military at a rapid rate. So this idea that somehow we've already spent so much money in the military—it's like, guys, don't overthink how strong we are. We—you probably know it, this was a couple of years ago, but we had one of our aircraft carriers sailing by Japan, and the Chinese pulled up behind it in a diesel sub, in a super-quiet diesel sub, pulled up behind it. It could have been torpedoed. And, I mean, we're in that kind of—our Navy's smaller in number of ships than anytime since 1917, and this president wants to shrink it. The list goes on. Our Air Force is older and smaller than anytime since '47 when the Air Force was formed, and he wants to shrink it. If we go the way of Europe, which is spending 1 to 2 percent of their economy on the military, we will not be able to have freedom in the world.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: When the [unintelligible] in September, the markets are going to be looking—marginal tax rates going up, overheads going, fine, but sequestration under the debt ceiling deal—what do they call it?
ROMNEY: Taxageddon?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, they call it that. The Obamacare, taxes on dividends and capital gains—I mean, the markets are going to be speaking very wildly in October on all of those issues.
ROMNEY: They'll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I'm going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the president's going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends, of course, which markets you're talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is, if we win on November 6th there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country. We'll see capital come back, and we'll see—without actually doing anything—we'll actually get a boost in the economy. If the president gets reelected, I don't know what will happen. I can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my own view is that if we get the—the "Taxageddon," as they call it, January 1st, with this president, and with a Congress that can't work together, it really is frightening, really frightening in my view.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fifty-four percent of American voters think China's economy is bigger than the US. When I first met you four or five years ago, you did a diagram where you went very granular and you said, "Look, guys"—this was a small group—and you said, "this is it, this is what it is, tell it like it is." How are you going to win if 54 percent of the voters think China's economy is bigger than ours? Or if it costs 4 cents to make a penny and we keep making pennies? Canada got it right a month ago. Why isn't someone saying, "Stop making pennies, round it to the nearest nickel?" You know, that's an easy thing, compared to Iran. I want to see you take the gloves off and talk to people that actually read the paper and read the book and care about knowing the facts and acknowledges power. As opposed to people who are swayed by, you know, what sounds good at the moment. If you turned it into like, "Eat what you kill," it'd be a landslide. In my humble opinion.
ROMNEY: [laughs] Well, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country. And people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don't think this will have a significant impact on my electability. Um, I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact. You know, I—
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No one even knows who Pete Peterson is and he's [unintelligible] trouble 20 years ago.
ROMNEY: But that's my point. Which is—my dad used to say, "Being right early is not good in politics." And in a setting like this—a highly intellectual subject, a discussion of a whole series of important topics—typically doesn't win elections. And there are, for instance, this president won because of hope and change. All right? He won because of hope and change.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Keep the change. [laughter]
ROMNEY: Yeah, well. So it's—I can tell you I have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants. A couple of people in particular who've done races around the world. I didn't realize these guys in the US, the Karl Rove equivalents, they do races all over the world. In Armenia. In Africa. In Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his races. So they do his races and see which ads work and which processes work best and, uh, we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. I'd tell them to you, but I'd have to, you know, shoot ya. [laughter] Hopefully it will be a successful place.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I think one of the aspects about hope and change that worked well for Obama four years ago was he promised to bring us more honest, transparent governance in Washington. I've been around politics—the first campaign I worked for was Barry Goldwater in 1964. I've gotta be the oldest Republican in [unintelligible]. But from what I've seen, particularly in the last seven months because of my own personal involvement in an issue, is the government in Washington right now is just permeated by cronyism, outright corruption. Our regulatory agencies that are supposed to protect the public are protecting the people that they're supposed to be regulating. And I think people are fed up with that. Doesn't matter if you're in the tea party of Occupy Wall Street, people see that the government is working for the powerful interests and the people who well-connected politically and not the common person. Which threatens that whole idea that we have this great opportunity—which we should have and have had, historically—in the US for anybody, from whatever background, to become successful. One way that that becomes compromised is when the government is no longer seen as being an honest agent. And where our tax dollars are not really being put to work for us but for the people who are plugged-in politically. You know, you had cases like Solyndra and [unintelligible] that I've talked about and gotten involved in. You have Eric Holder who is probably the most corrupt attorney general that we had ever in American history. And I think it's something that if spun the right way in simple terms can actually resonate with the American people. Obama did not keep his promises. Nancy Pelosi was supposed to give us an honest Congress and has given us just the opposite as speaker. And I think that's a campaign issue that can work well. I'm optimistic that you'll be elected president. And my recommendation would be clean house, immediately. The SEC, the CFEC are disaster areas.
ROMNEY: I wish they weren't unionized, so we could go a lot deeper than you're actually allowed to go. Yeah. I can say this, which I'm sure you'll agree with this as well. We speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told you, the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side, they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, "Do you think Barack Obama is a failure?" they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, "Are you disappointed in his policies that haven't worked?" they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don't want to be told that they were wrong, that he's a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he's corrupt. Those people that we that have to get, they want to think they did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase, "He's in over his head."
But we, you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us, and these people are people who voted for him and don't agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have speaking with those people is, you know, the president's been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent, hasn't been below 8 percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won't graduate from high school. What are they gonna do? They usually pass on saying...and I could say to that audience that they nod their heads and say, "Yeah, I think you're right." What's he going to do by the way is try and vilify me as someone who's been successful. Or who's closed business or laid people off—an evil, bad guy. And that may work. I actually think that right now people are saying, "I want somebody who can make things better, that's gonna motivate me, who can get jobs for my kids and get rising incomes." And I hope to be able to be the one who wins that battle.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've seen Obama a lot of times on talk shows, interviews, but I've never seen you on any of them. I think a lot of people, especially you know, [unintelligible] I think people would see you in a different light. I think a lot of women especially do not watch debates. They don't come to these functions. You maybe have to show your face more on TV and talk just like regular [unintelligible] typical American last name.
ROMNEY: Smith.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: In Sweden, you say Johansson. [laughter]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I think maybe you could reach a lot of people.
ROMNEY: Well, thank you. I have been on The View twice now. [laughter] I've been on The View twice. It went very well.
ROMNEY: Regis is gone. I've done the night, the evening shows. I've been on Letterman a couple of times. I've been on Leno more than a couple times, and now Letterman hates me because I've been on Leno more than him. They're very jealous of one another as you know. And there's, I was asked to go on Saturday Night Live. I did not do that, in part because you want to show that you're fun and you're a good person, but you also want to be presidential. And Saturday Night Live has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential. But The View is fine. Although The View is high risk because of the five women on it, only one is conservative. Four are sharp-tongued and not conservative, Whoopi Goldberg in particular. Although last time I was on the show, she said to me, "You know what? I think I could vote for you." And I said, "I must have done something really wrong." [laughter] I had to sit down and—oop, Darlene, you get the last word.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was just gonna say, I think a media strategy would be sending Ann on the road. Because she, I think, is your best friend, your best advocate. She connects so well. People talk so much about this connect—and somebody said over there, people think he's a rich, rich guy. Most of us know that you know that's—
ROMNEY: You know that I'm as poor as a church mouse. [laughter]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We know that you value [unintelligible] and hard work. And Ann really connects with people, and she can tell a story about the hard work and she can tell about the person who [unintelligible] and go on Good Morning America and go on The View and hold her own against these people. And really get you the women connecting to you more. Seeing her and think she's a great—
ROMNEY: I think you're right. Absolutely right. We use Ann sparingly right now, so that people don't tired of her, or start attacking.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who gets tired of Ann?
ROMNEY: [laughter] I'll tell ya—. But you will see more of her in the September, October timeframe. And you know we had, what's her name, Hilary Rosen, who, you know, attacked her, and that made Ann much more visible to the American people, which I think is very helpful. It gave her a platform she wouldn't have had otherwise. And I agree with you. I think she will be extraordinarily helpful.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just a quick—. Can you be a friend of her on Facebook or whatever happened after Hilary Rosen [unintelligible]...That shows you the value of social networking and just how important the media can be in this election cycle, and I just think that she is amazing. And I know she wants, she wants [unintelligible]...
ROMNEY: She's out there. She's, she's in Texas tonight. She was in Louisiana last night. She's raising money in those places. She was at Ben Crenshaw's house for dinner today, tonight. [unintelligible] So there are some benefits. One of the benefits I get is eating the world's best dessert, which I will. [laughter] Thank you. [applause]

Videotaped Remarks On Cuban Independence Day

May 18, 2012

Mitt Romney today made the following remarks on Cuban Independence Day, which is celebrated this coming Sunday, May 20th:
To View The Video Of The Speech, Click Here: http://mi.tt/JnQMaY
Today, I join with the Cuban people—on the island, here in America, and elsewhere in the world—in honoring the independence that was so dearly won by brave Cubans over a century ago. The struggle for Cuban independence was based on the principles of liberty, and won through the courage and sacrifice that the yearning for freedom inspires.
Today is a recognition of freedom's triumph, but it's also a sobering reminder that over 50 years of Cuba's history have been lost to the tyranny of the Castro regime.
Since Castro took power, the Cuban people have been denied basic human freedoms. No freedom of religion, no freedom of the press, no political freedom. And the regime uses brutality and violence to suppress these freedoms and impose its will.
In recent years and months, we have seen the deaths of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, Juan Wilfredo Soto, Wilman Villar and Laura Pollan at the hands of the dictatorship. We have witnessed the continued incarceration of peaceful pro-democracy activists and the unlawful imprisonment of Alan Gross.
These injustices make painfully clear that the Castros' grip on power remains as tight as ever. The regime touts so-called "reforms," but the facts point to continued oppression. The Cuban people still live in constant fear of a brutal totalitarian regime that has demonstrated time and again its utter disregard for basic human dignity.
The fight for a free Cuba has gone on for far too long.
Too many dreams have been shattered, too many lives have been ruined, and too many families have been separated by the tyranny of the Castro regime.
Too many Independence Day celebrations have passed with that regime still clinging to power.
And too many political leaders—on both sides of the aisle—have lauded the dream of a free Cuba on this day over the years, only to falter in realizing that dream once in office.
In recent years, we have seen the United States back away from pressuring the Castro regime, under the misguided view that placating them with an open hand would yield progress. That naivetй has invited only more cruelty and oppression in return.
Today, we join Cubans around the world in celebrating independence and remembering the brave men and women who gave their lives in the fight for freedom. And to those who continue the fight, I offer not only words of support, but the promise of action.
If I am elected President, the Castro regime will have no reason to doubt our unwavering commitment to your cause. The regime will feel the full weight of American resolve.
The international community will know that the future of Cuba is within the leadership of the Cuban pro-democracy movement, represented in men and women like Jose Daniel Ferrer, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez "Antunez," Sara Marta Fonseca, and Berta Soler.
And, together, we will hasten the day when the regime will come to an end.
"Like bones to the human body, the axle to the wheel, the wing to the bird, and the air to the wing, so is liberty the essence of life." These were the words of Jose Marti at the time of Cuba's fight for independence.
Those words rang true for Cuba a century ago. Soon, they will ring true once again.

Remarks on Education at The Latino Coalition's Annual Economic Summit in Washington, D.C.: "A Chance For Every Child"

May 23, 2012

Thanks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for hosting us. This year the Chamber marks 100 years of Standing Up for American Enterprise. Few organizations have fought longer or harder for the principles of economic freedom. And these days, your voice is more important than ever.
I am grateful to the Latino Coalition for the invitation to be part of your Annual Economic Summit. In recent days we've heard a lot about business from the President and if you're feeling like you deserve protection under the Endangered Species Act, I can't blame you.
This is a time when everybody in this administration should be doing everything in their power to support you. If every one of our small businesses added just two employees, Americans could pay more mortgages and buy more groceries and fill their gas tanks.
Instead, sadly, President Obama has decided to attack success. It's no wonder so many of his own supporters are calling on him to stop this war on job creators. Make no mistake, when I am President, you won't wake up every day and wonder if the President is on your side.
Starting on Day One, I'll be there to help you make it. And if you're successful beyond your wildest dreams, I'll be the first to celebrate your success because I know your prosperity means greater opportunity – for you, for your families, for your employees, and for your communities. And that's what the American Dream is all about.
During my lifetime, I've seen a few of my own dreams come true. I've run and started business, helped guide the Olympics, and led a great state. I learned early on that the only way to succeed in tough situations is to bring people together for a common purpose. That's how you achieve greatness and accomplish your goals.
Dividing people and pitting one side against another produces nothing but failure and mediocrity. Unfortunately, we've seen too much of that from this administration. That's part of why we're facing the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. And it's why this President and his party have failed to address the most serious problems facing our country.
When the President took office, he faced a jobs crisis. It's barely improved. He faced a spending crisis. It's only gotten worse. And he faced an education crisis.
I'd love to stand here today and join you in celebrating the end of our education crisis. Wouldn't it be great if we could look back on the last four years with confidence that the crisis had been confronted and we'd turned the corner toward a brighter future?
But sadly, that hasn't happened. And the tragedy is not just a matter of test scores and international rankings. It's the frustration of a sixth grader who wants to learn more, but is stuck in a class that's moving too slowly. It's the embarrassment of a 10th grader who knows he can't read the books he's assigned. It's the shame of a 12th grader who's supposed to be ready to graduate, but hasn't mastered the skills he or she needs to succeed in life.
In this country, we believe every child has something to contribute. No matter what circumstances they were born into, every child has a dream about where they can go or what they can become. Whether that dream is to invent something, start something, build something, or create something, it all starts with the basic skills and confidence that only a good education can provide.
Yet, today, too many dreams are never realized because our education system is failing.
More than 150 years ago, our nation pioneered public education. We've now fallen way behind.
Among developed countries, the United States comes in 14th of 34 in reading, 17th of 34 in science, and an abysmal 25th out of 34 in math.
Our public education system is supposed to ensure that every child gets a strong start in life. Yet, one in four students fails to attain a high school degree. And in our major cities, half of our kids won't graduate. Imagine that.
Imagine if your enterprise had a 25% to 50% failure rate in meeting its primary goal. You would consider that a crisis. You would make changes, and fast. Because if you didn't, you'd go out of business.
But America's public education establishment shows no sense of urgency. Instead, there is a fierce determination to keep things the way they are.
Here we are in the most prosperous nation, but millions of kids are getting a third-world education. And, America's minority children suffer the most. This is the civil-rights issue of our era. It's the great challenge of our time.
Last week, I spoke about the prairie fire of debt that is spreading across our country. Today, I want to talk about our crisis in education. With all of our economic troubles, there's a temptation to put off the task of fixing our nations' schools for another time. But the jobs and housing failures of these past few years only make that task more important.
Let's not kid ourselves – we are in the midst of a National Education Emergency. The only reason we don't hear more about it is because our economic troubles have taken our national attention away from the classroom. But if unemployment was where it should be and home values were going up, there is no question that the crisis in American education would be the great cause of this campaign.
Of course, the jobs and housing failures of these past few years only make the need for educational improvement all the more critical. So I'll be blunt: I don't like the direction of American education, and as President, I will do everything in my power to reverse this decline.
Much as you have in your own business careers, I've found that you can't expect dramatically different results unless you are open to dramatic change. As president, I will pursue bold policy changes that will restore the promise of our nation's education system.
First, I will expand parental choice in an unprecedented way. Too many of our kids are trapped in schools that are failing or simply don't meet their needs. And for too long, we've merely talked about the virtues of school choice.
As President, I will give the parents of every low-income and special needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school. For the first time in history, federal education funds will be linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school, or to a private school, where permitted. And I will make that choice meaningful by ensuring there are sufficient options to exercise it.
To receive the full complement of federal education dollars, states must provide students with ample school choice. In addition, digital learning options must not be prohibited. And charter schools or similar education choices must be scaled up to meet student demand.
Instead of eliminating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program as President Obama has proposed, I will expand it to offer more students a chance to attend a better school. It will be a model for parental choice programs across the nation.
Parental choice will hold schools responsible for results, but parents can only exercise that choice effectively if they have good information. No Child Left Behind helped our nation take a giant step forward in bridging this information gap. But the law is not without its weaknesses. As president, I will break the political logjam that has prevented successful reform of the law. I will reduce federal micromanagement while redoubling efforts to ensure that schools are held responsible for results.
For example, parents shouldn't have to navigate a cryptic evaluation system to figure out how their kids' schools are performing. States must provide a simple-to-read and widely available public report card that evaluates each school. These report cards will provide accurate and easy-to-understand information about student and school performance. States will continue to design their own standards and tests, but the report cards will provide information that parents can use to make informed choices.
We will take bold steps to ensure our system welcomes and rewards the best teachers. As president, I will make it my goal to ensure that every classroom has a quality teacher.
There are currently 82 programs in ten agencies that spend $4 billion on teacher quality. As president, I will consolidate these programs, and block grant them to states that adopt innovative policies. For example, states will be rewarded if they regularly evaluate teachers for their effectiveness and compensate the best teachers for their success. Teaching is a highly valued profession that must attract and retain the best and brightest.
Dramatically expanding parental choice, making schools responsible for results by giving parents access to clear and instructive information, and attracting and rewarding our best teachers--these changes can help ensure that every parent has a choice and every child has a chance.
Finally, since we live in a twenty-first century economy that increasingly demands a college education, efforts at improvement can't stop at high school's end. Students must have access to a wide variety of options that will give them the skills they need for successful careers. We must stop fueling skyrocketing tuition prices that put higher education out of reach for some and leave others with crushing debt.
These are bold initiatives that will produce better outcomes for our parents and teachers and students. But accomplishing real change won't be easy. Efforts to truly reform our schools always meet strong resistance from entrenched interests.
The teachers unions are the clearest example of a group that has lost its way. Whenever anyone dares to offer a new idea, the unions protest the loudest.
Their attitude was memorably expressed by a long-time president of the American Federation of Teachers: He said, quote, "When school children start paying union dues, that's when I'll start representing the interests of children."
The teachers unions don't fight for our children. That's our job. And our job keeps getting harder because the unions wield outsized influence in elections and campaigns.
Annually, many teachers are forced to pay almost $1,000 in union dues. The two major teachers unions take in $600 million each year. That's more revenue than both of the political parties combined.
In 2008, the National Education Association spent more money on campaigns than any other organization in the country. And 90% of those funds went to Democrats.
Education is one issue where it should be easy to find common purpose and common solutions. And I believe the President must be troubled by the lack of progress since he took office. Most likely, he would have liked to do more. But the teachers unions are one of the Democrats' biggest donors – and one of the President's biggest campaign supporters. So, President Obama has been unable to stand up to union bosses – and unwilling to stand up for kids.
The most recent example is the Opportunity Scholarship program. Since 2004, it's allowed thousands of children in the District of Columbia to escape one of the worst school systems in the nation and get a world-class education. Armed with scholarships of up to $7,500, students enrolled in private schools. 99% of them were African American or Hispanic.
After three months, students could already read at levels 19 months ahead of their public-school peers. And parents were happy; for every spot in the program, there were 4 applications.
Then, Senator Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, inserted a provision to end the program. The White House offered no resistance. In fact, the President has proposed ending all funding for Opportunity Scholarships. It must have gone against his better instincts, but the unions wanted it so he went along.
In the Opportunity Scholarships, the Democrats finally found the one federal program they are willing to cut. Why? Because success anywhere in our public schools is a rebuke to failure everywhere else. That's why the unions oppose even the most common sense improvements.
In Detroit, students in the city's failing public schools were offered a lifeline by a philanthropist who offered $200 million to create 15 charter schools. The teachers union made the state legislature turn that gift down.
In Connecticut, parents groups tried to pass "parent trigger" legislation so they could take over and transform failing schools. A national teachers union moved fast to stop that.
Now some union leaders will tell you that their objections are misunderstood. They'll argue the issues are complicated. But really it's simple – and it comes down to this: When your cause in life is preventing parents from having a meaningful choice or children from having a real chance, then you are on the wrong side. You might even be in the wrong vocation, because good teachers put the interests of children first.
The same is true of a good president. In his speeches, President Obama likes to tell us "we can't wait." If only he would say that and mean it about education reform – because millions are waiting for change, and so many are missing their chance.
The President can't have it both ways: He can't talk up reform, while indulging the groups that block it. He can't be the voice of disadvantaged public-school kids, and the protector of special interests.
President Obama has made his choice, and I have made mine: As president, I will be a champion of real education reform in America, and I won't let any special interest get in the way.
We have to stop putting campaign cash ahead of our kids.
This is a battle we can and must win. And while a lot needs fixing, we're getting some of the most important things right.
We have good teachers, like the ones who are leading New York City's Democracy Prep. Because of them, kids from the city's poorest community are outperforming children from the wealthiest. Last summer, these teachers took over the worst elementary school in Harlem rather than let it shut down. Democracy Prep is a testament to good people who refuse to give up on our kids or leave our cities without a fight.
And leadership makes a huge difference. When Jeb Bush became governor of Florida, reading scores of Hispanic students in that state's school system were dismal. He brought focused innovation and passionate leadership. Today those scores have risen dramatically.
But too often, new ideas, good teachers, and dedicated parents don't find a welcoming partner and true champion in elected officials like Governor Bush. Instead, they are met with resistance and resentment from the establishment.
I know what it is like to be a Governor fighting to do things differently. You need every bit of help you can get. As President, I'll stand shoulder to shoulder with these reformers and innovators.
When I became Governor, we were in the midst of instituting tough, bi-partisan education reforms. They included the requirement that every student pass a test to graduate from high school. The test came under attack from the unions. But we stood our ground.
We also offered our best students a four-year, tuition-free scholarship to the state college of their choice. I called it the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship, after two Massachusetts citizens who understood the importance of education to our nation.
Every year I'd ask a school principal to invite the students who scored in the top 25% on the exam to a special assembly. After some words about hard work, I'd ask them to reach under their chair and remove an envelope that had been taped there. And I'd watch as each of them would open the enclosed letter.
Every year, I'd stand in front of the room and the same scene would unfold:
At first, you could hear a pin drop. Then each student's eyes would get big and proud smiles would creep across their faces as they found out how well they had done on the exam. And then they would read the part of the letter where they learned they'd earned an Adams Scholarship. The smiles turned into cheers – and the sound was deafening.
I got more hugs on Adams Scholarship day than I did at Christmas. Kids would bring me their cell phones so I could tell their parents the exciting news. And parents – more than once – told me that they had been worried they would not be able to afford college and that the scholarship would make a difference.
Here in America, every child deserves a chance. It shouldn't be reserved for the fortunate few.
If America is going to continue to lead the world in how much we build, create, and invent, then we must transform how we teach, train, and educate. We already have good teachers, engaged parents, and big ideas. What we need now is strong leadership and the political will.
A choice for every parent means a chance for every child. That can be more than our hope – it can be our future. It can begin this year, in the choice you make, so I ask for your help, your support, and your vote on the sixth of November.
Thank you all, and God bless America.

Remarks in St. Louis, Missouri: "A Champion For Free Enterprise"

June 7, 2012

Thank you. It is great to be here.
We launched this campaign a little over a year ago. It's been a remarkable journey. I've traveled across this great country and had the privilege to visit with Americans from every walk of life. As those of the traveling press corps can attest, we've brought our campaign to every kind of business imaginable, from factory floors to lumber yards to warehouses of every shape and size.
But whatever the business, everywhere I go, I hear frustration and disappointment in the lack of economic progress of the past three and a half years. Americans are tired of being tired. They're tired of working harder for less and now for the first time, more Americans are starting to think our future might not be as bright as our past. That lack of faith in the future is a bridge to despair that we cannot cross.
An America that does not believe that tomorrow and tomorrow's tomorrow will be better is not the America we know and love.
I've spoken often of the President's failures of policy. From the stimulus bill that gave us Solyndra but left us with record unemployment, to the job-crushing over-regulation of the EPA, to the smothering economic effects of Obamacare, this President's misguided policies have been muddled, confused and simply ineffective. When you look around at America's economy, three and half years into this presidency, it's painfully obvious that this inexperienced President was simply not up to the task of solving a great economic crisis.
But today I want to speak to the road ahead and why I believe the disappointments of the past years have been a breach of faith with the American people.
America is rightly heralded as the greatest experiment in self-governance in world history. We are all here today because of a startling conviction that free individuals could join together to decide their fate and that more freedom made us all stronger.
Our example – and commitment – to freedom has changed the world. But along with the genius of our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights, is the equal genius of our economic system. Our Founding Fathers endeavored to create a moral and just society like no other in history, and out of that grew a moral and just economic system the likes of which the world had never seen. Our freedom, what it means to be an American, has been defined and sustained by the liberating power of the free enterprise system.
That same system has helped lift more people out of poverty across the globe than any government program or competing economic system. The success of America's free enterprise system has been a bright beacon of freedom for the world. It has signaled to oppressed people to rise up against their oppressors, and given hope to the once hopeless.
It is called the Free Enterprise System because we are both free to engage in enterprises and through those enterprises we ensure our freedom.
But sadly, it has become clear that this President simply doesn't understand or appreciate these fundamental truths of our system. Over the last three and a half years, record numbers of Americans have lost their jobs or simply disappeared from the work force. Record numbers of Americans are living in poverty today – over 46 million of our fellow Americans are living below the poverty line.
This is not just a failure of policy; it is a moral failure of tragic proportions. Our government has an absolute moral commitment to help every American help themselves and today, that fundamental commitment has been broken.
I do not believe this has been done with evil intent or ill will. But for a family watching their house being sold at foreclosure, or the family that is forced to spend their kid's college savings just to make ends meet, the results are just as devastating.
These are not statistics, these are our fellow Americans. As your President, starting on Day One, I will do everything in my power to end these days of drift and disappointment. There is something fundamentally wrong when there are over 23 million Americans who are unemployed, underemployed, or have stopped looking for work, and yet the President tells us he's doing a great job.
I will not be that President of deception and doubt. I will lead us to a better place.
For three and a half years, President Obama has expanded government instead of empowering the American people. He's put us deeper into debt. He's slowed the recovery and harmed our economy. And he has attacked the cornerstone of American prosperity: our economic freedom.
Today, government at all levels consumes 37 percent of the total economy or G.D.P. If Obamacare is allowed to stand, government will reach half of the American economy. And through the increasing controls government has imposed on industries like energy, financial services and automobiles, it will soon effectively control the majority of our economic activity.
One must ask whether we will still be a free enterprise nation and whether we will still have economic freedom. America is on the cusp of having a government-run economy. President Obama is transforming America into something very different than the land of the free and the land of opportunity.
We know where that transformation leads. There are other nations that have chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and stagnant wages.
I don't want to transform America; I want to restore the values of economic freedom.
So for every government-spending proposal, I will ask the following question: "Is this program so important that it is worth borrowing more money from China to pay for it?" With our nation facing 16 trillion dollars in debt, most times the answer will be an easy and unqualified "no." We've seen how fast our debt can grow. It's time to see how fast our economy can grow, and the first step is spending discipline.
Instead of throwing more borrowed money at bad ideas, I will lower tax rates, simplify the tax code, and get the American economy running at full strength.
Under President Obama, a single, massive law has spread so much uncertainty across the economy, especially to the small companies that employ about half of America's workers and create most of our new jobs. They have no idea how many more taxes and regulations are coming. And they sense from Washington an outright hostility toward what they do and what they hope to achieve.
So, as president, I will begin with an equally big dose of certainty across our economy: By granting waivers to all fifty states, I will start the process of repealing Obamacare on Day One.
In a free-enterprise system, we don't measure our success in equal outcomes, but instead in how well we preserve and promote the equality of opportunity. And this system has resulted in unrivaled prosperity and made America the greatest nation in history.
President Obama's vision is very different – and deeply flawed. There is nothing fair about a government that favors political connections over honest competition and takes away your right to earn your own success. And there is nothing morally right about trying to turn government dependence into a substitute for the dignity of work.
Where my vision believes in the ingenuity of the American people, his vision trusts the wisdom of political appointees and boards, commissions and czars. It's one in which ordinary Americans must get permission from people in Washington before they can buy, build, invest or hire.
It's a world of federal mandates and waivers, tax credits and subsidies, federal grants and loan guarantees. It's an economy where a company's lobbyists will be more important than its engineers, and federal compliance lawyers will outnumber patent lawyers.
Business models based on building a better mousetrap will give way to those that seek the right mix of government subsidies, waivers and loan guarantees. And Chief Government Officers will join the ranks of Chief Financial Officers and Chief Operating Officers in corporate America's executive ranks.
President Obama trusts in the wisdom of government. I put my trust in the ingenuity and creativity and commitment to hard work of the American people.
Looking at the sorry economic record of this administration, it's easy to lose heart, and even to give up – as so many have in their search for a job. The President and his team would like us to believe that somehow it's the fault of the free market that things haven't gone right. That's just another way of saying that it's your fault, and not theirs, that the real recovery hasn't yet arrived.
We have waited, and waited, and waited for recovery. And enough time has passed to pronounce judgment on the economic policies of this administration. They have not worked. And you, the entrepreneurs and workers of America, have not failed these past three and a half years – your government has failed you.
Never before has federal policy run so contrary to the needs, ideals, and aspirations of the American entrepreneur. And with all that we've been through these past few years, the challenges can seem awfully big. Some might wonder if we have lost our confidence. But confidence is not what is missing – all that's lacking is direction and leadership.
This President believes in an America of limits, where it is more important to focus on allocating the rewards of success than helping everyone succeed. That is an America of diminished opportunity and increased disappointment, of long unemployment lines and small dreams.
I believe in a very different America. If we embrace the future with leadership that does everything possible to unlock the potential of our economic might, we can enter a new era of prosperity the likes of which we have never seen. We cannot shy away from greatness for fear that some might succeed more than others. Just as every American who can't find work makes our light shine a little less bright, success breeds success. It's not just our economy that is hurting -- it is our American spirit.
It doesn't have to be this way. These have been years of disappointment and decline, and soon we can put them behind us. We can prosper again, with the powerful recovery we have all been waiting for, the good jobs that so many still need, and, above all, the opportunities we owe to our children and grandchildren.
All of this can be more than our hope – it can be our future. It can begin this year, in the choice you make, so I ask for your help, your support, and your vote on the sixth of November.
Thank you all, and God bless America.

Remarks in Stratham, New Hampshire

June 15, 2012

Thank you for that warm welcome. It's great to be back in Stratham. And I'd like to thank Doug and Stella for welcoming us once again to their beautiful farm.
Ann and I visited this farm a year ago when we launched our campaign for the Republican nomination. It was a beautiful day, and the start of a remarkable journey.
Over the past year, it's become clear that good things begin here, so today we're back, with a few more friends and closer to the goal. Every day our campaign grows as more and more Americans realize that we don't have to settle for these years of disappointment and decline.
America can do better – and with your help, we will. Together, we're going to take this campaign all way to the White House.
Since last June, we've been to towns, big and small. We've visited businesses – some generations old, others quite new, every one of them trying to make the best of a bad economy. Across the country, people have welcomed us into their homes. We've enjoyed long talks about family and country in break rooms and backyards, in diners and on factory floors.
Everywhere I go, I meet people who represent the best of America. They are hopeful, hard-working, determined and proud. But they are also worried and anxious. They are tired of being tired.
And they are tired of a detached and distant President who never seems to hear their voices.
When Americans rose up and demanded, "Stop borrowing money and sticking our kids with the bill," the President wasn't listening. He was on the line with China, taking out another loan.
When Americans went to town halls and said, "We don't want Obamacare," the President ignored us, and spent fifteen months ramming his health-care bill through Congress on a party-line vote.
And when we asked, "Where is the recovery we were promised?" this President lectured us saying "The private sector is doing fine."
For so many Americans the distance between their town and the city of Washington has never seemed so far. The federal establishment has never seemed so hostile or remote – so disconnected from economic reality, and yet so willing to use restrictions and regulations, taxes and fines, commissions and czars to direct our daily lives.
The President's plans have Americans wondering whether our future can be as bright as our past. But that lack of faith in our future is a bridge to despair that we cannot cross.
That's why, from now until November, our campaign will carry a simple message: America's greatest days are ahead!
Washington's big government agenda should not smother small-town dreams. In the America we love, every town counts. Every job counts. And every American counts!
We're here today to launch a campaign bus tour that will take us from New Hampshire to Pennsylvania, then to Ohio and on to Iowa, Wisconsin and, finally, Michigan.
In the days ahead, we'll be traveling on what are often called the "backroads of America." But I think our tour takes us along much of the "backbone of America."
This is the America known for thriving farms and factories. For prosperous towns and cities and great colleges and universities. For solid communities and churches. All of them born out of American optimism; nourished and sustained by hard work and a belief that the American future is one of limitless possibilities and that opportunity is an American birthright.
We will travel through the industrial heartland of America. This was once a model to the world for mining, manufacturing, and innovation. Many of the greatest commercial enterprises in the history of the world were born here. They gave birth to an extraordinary middle class which never questioned their ability to build a better life for their children.
But in these past few years, too many of these Americans have been struggling and in distress.
But even where factories have closed and jobs are too few, the spirit of enterprise -- the spirit that powered the engines of America's remarkable economic growth and prosperity -- that spirit still lives strong. And it is the goal of this campaign -- and will be the mission of my presidency -- to nurture that spirit and to see it flourish once again.
The world knows the names of great cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago and Cleveland. These were the arsenals of democracy, the forges of freedom, the melting pots of America. Their resilience and indomitable energy are a cornerstone of America's future.
But we should never forget that some of America's biggest dreams were also born in our smallest communities. Our small towns have given us great writers, great thinkers, and great leaders.
Before they were literary giants who dazzled the world, great American writers like Mark Twain and John Steinbeck were kids playing in wide-open spaces, dreaming up the stories they would tell.
Before they were pioneers, Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers looked out into the dark night and up at the clear blue sky, imagining great inventions that would someday change the world. And, no, Mr. President, they were not dreaming of a government loan.
And small towns gave us Lincoln and Truman, Eisenhower and Reagan – and so many sons and daughters who have sacrificed to defend our freedom on battlefields far away.
The vision and the values, the character and the can-do spirit that you find in our small towns have made America great. In these places, you also find a special sense of community and a deep commitment to our country.
These Americans are quiet heroes. They raise strong families, run our factories, and grow our food. They coach Little League and soccer. They serve on the PTA. They volunteer to help their neighbors. And they dream big dreams – sometimes for themselves, but mostly for their kids.
Every town counts because the families who have lost a job, faced a foreclosure, or been forced to spend the money they were saving for college just to make ends meet are not statistics – they are our fellow Americans.
In recent years, they have shown great determination and real bravery. These men and women do the hard things that others say aren't worth trying. They keep pressing on, even when government bureaucrats and regulations keep getting in their way. They have talent and creativity – and they aren't about to let their family or our country down by letting their dreams go. They are the backbone of America.
Yesterday the President gave a speech. A Very. Long. Speech.
You might have thought that it would be a moment when he would acknowledge his policy mistakes and suggest a new course. But no. He promised four more years, of more of the same. Four. More. Very. Long. Years.
That's really the divide in this race. The President thinks we're on the right track and his policies are working.
And I...I believe with all my heart that we can -- that we must -- do better!
So let me ask where you stand. Do you believe America can do better? Do you believe that with new leadership and a new president our greatest days are still ahead? Do you believe we can take back the White House and reclaim the greatness of America?
Somewhere in that long speech, President Obama spoke of giving people a "fair shot." I couldn't agree more.
President Obama isn't giving our students a fair shot when they graduate and only half of them can find jobs or work that matches their skills.
And he isn't giving the middle class a fair shot when wages keep going down and prices keep going up. Under Barack Obama, more Americans are living in poverty than under any President in history. That's a tragedy, not a fair shot!
He didn't give the children of Washington, DC a fair shot when he proposed to end their scholarships to go to better schools.
And when he bows to the demands of the teacher's unions, he isn't giving a fair shot to kids across America.
He isn't giving entrepreneurs and job creators a fair shot when he picks winners and losers, rewarding campaign donors with tax dollars in scandals like Solyndra.
Barack Obama isn't giving a fair shot to our children and grandchildren when he saddles them with trillions of dollars of debts.
If there has ever been a president who has failed to give the middle class of America a fair shot, it is Barack Obama.
I have a very different vision for America, and of our future. And I know what we must do to truly give our fellow Americans a fair shot...and a better chance.
I see an America where free enterprise is nurtured and celebrated, not attacked, because freedom and free enterprise is what creates jobs, not government. I see an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living. I see children even more successful than their parents -- some successful beyond their wildest dreams -- and others congratulating them for their achievement, not attacking them for it. We must not allow the desperation of a failing Presidency to divide this great country.
I see an America that is fundamentally fair, that cares for those who cannot care for themselves, that never wavers from our commitment to our seniors, and that gives our veterans the respect and care they richly deserve.
In the America I see, character and choices matter. And education, hard work, and living within our means are valued and rewarded. And poverty will be defeated, not with a government check, but with respect and achievement that is taught by parents, learned in school, and practiced in the workplace.
This is the America that was won for us by the nation's Founders, and earned for us by the Greatest Generation. It is the America that has produced the most innovative, most productive, and most powerful economy in the world.
As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, the graduates who can't get a job, the soldiers who return home to an unemployment line, it breaks my heart. This does not have to be. It is the result of failed leadership and of a faulty vision.
I am running for President because I have the experience and the vision to get us out of this mess. I am offering a real choice and a new beginning.
We can't afford four more years of failed policies and weak leadership.
Starting on Day One, I will do what it takes to get America back to work.
Obamacare will end.
We'll open markets around the world, and make sure that countries like China finally play by the rules.
We'll get the Keystone Pipeline built and we'll send a message to the world that a new era of energy independence has begun right here on our continent.
We'll replace the Obama job killing tax policies with sweeping tax reform to jumpstart job creation.
The government regulators who are strangling small business will finally learn that job creators are our friends, not our enemies.
And once again, the Era of Big Government will be over!
No wonder Bill Clinton and so many other mainstream Democrats are revolting against the backward direction President Obama is taking his Party and our country!
Let us make today the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the Obama years.
Let us make today the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together.
For every single mom who feels heartbroken when she has to explain to her kids that she needs to take a second job ... for every grandparent who can't afford the gas to visit the grandkids... for the mom and dad who never thought they'd be on food stamps ... for the small business owner desperately cutting back just to keep the doors open one more month...
To all of the thousands of good and decent Americans I've met who want nothing more than a better chance, a fighting chance, to all of you, I have a simple message: Hold on a little longer. A better America begins today!
Today the hill before us is a little steep but we have always been a nation of big steppers.
Many Americans have given up on this President but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America.
In the days ahead, join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the Promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little bigger, the help wanted signs can be dusted off, and we can start again.
And this time we'll get it right. We'll stop the days of apologizing for success at home and never again apologize for America abroad.
There was a time – not so long ago – when each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without question. And so did the world.
Those days are coming back. That's our destiny. Join me. Let's walk together, every day until November 6th.
We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still ahead. We are, after all, Americans!
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando, Florida

June 21, 2012

Thank you for inviting me to your annual conference. It's an honor to be here among so many dedicated elected leaders.
I come to you today as a candidate for President of the United States of America. I will govern from the principle that while this is a land of extraordinary diversity, there is much more that unites us than divides us. Though each of us walks a different path in life, we are united by one great, overwhelming passion: We love America. We believe in America. We are one nation, under God.
Today, we are united not only by our faith in America. We are united also by our concern for America.
This country we love is in peril. That is why I am running for President.
Almost four years ago, Americans did something that was very much the sort of thing Americans like to do: We gave someone new a chance to lead; someone we hadn't known for very long, who didn't have much of a record but promised to lead us to a better place.
At the time, we didn't know what sort of a President he would make. It was a moment of crisis for our economy, and when Barack Obama came to office, America wished him well and hoped for the best.
Three and a half years later, over 23 million Americans are out of work, underemployed or have just quit looking for work. At a time when we should be gaining momentum, we're losing it. Job growth has slowed and this week, we learned that the number of job openings has fallen again.
Hispanics have been hit disproportionately hard. While national unemployment is still above 8%, Hispanic unemployment is at 11%.
The middle class has been crushed under President Obama. More Americans are living in poverty today than at any point in history. Over two million more Hispanics are living in poverty today than the day President Obama took office.
Home values have plunged, our national debt is at record levels and families are buried under higher prices for food and gasoline.
And yet our President says the private sector is doing fine. This is more than a policy failure; it is a moral failure.
Now, I know the President will say that he inherited an economic crisis. But we shouldn't allow the challenges he faced four years ago to divert our attention from another important fact: The President pursued policies that have made this the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. And he broke promises many were counting on to build a brighter future.
It did not have to be this way.
Just compare this President's record with Ronald Reagan's first term. President Reagan also faced an economic crisis. In fact, in 1982, the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 11 percent. But in the two years that followed, he delivered a true recovery – economic growth and job creation were three times higher than in the Obama Economy.
If President Obama had delivered a real recovery – a Reagan recovery – we would have five million more jobs today. The unemployment rate would be about six percent. And our economy would be at least one trillion dollars larger.
Tomorrow, President Obama will speak here, for the first time since his last campaign. He may admit that he hasn't kept every promise. And he'll probably say that, even though you aren't better off today than you were four years ago, things could be worse. He'll imply that you really don't have an alternative. He's taking your vote for granted.
I've come here today with a simple message: You do have an alternative. Your vote should be respected. And your voice is more important now than ever before.
This November, we'll make a choice. We can continue along the path we're on – or we can choose a better way.
Instead of continuing with the policies of the last three and a half years, we can revitalize our free-enterprise economy. We can lead the world in what we invent and build and create. And let me make this very clear—this is the only way we can strengthen the middle class. And this is the only way we can create sustained prosperity. Raising taxes to grow government does not grow the middle class.
Today, I am asking you to join me because, while we may not agree on everything, we share the same goal, the same vision, and the same belief in American greatness that draws so many to our shores. Liberty's torch can burn just as brightly for future generations of immigrants as it has burned for immigrants past.
We know our businesses can't succeed, grow, and hire more workers without a more competitive tax code. That's why I will lower our corporate tax rate, and reduce individual marginal rates by 20 percent, across the board.
We also know that our businesses and families need affordable and reliable energy. Producing more of our energy resources will create jobs in America and generate greater revenues for America. It will also help bring manufacturing back to our shores.
We know our economy can't grow if we're mortgaging our future to pay for the big government programs of today. As President, I will rein in spending and balance the budget. And I will repeal Obamacare. We cannot afford another $2 trillion entitlement. Obamacare depresses job growth. In one study, 73 percent of business owners said that Obamacare has made it harder for them to hire people. Repealing Obamacare and replacing it will give businesses the certainty they need to hire, expand, and grow.
We can also jumpstart our economy by expanding trade in our hemisphere. Yet, the President has not completed a single new trade agreement with Latin America. And he's failed to crack down on countries like China that don't follow the rules.
We know our kids can't succeed if they're trapped in failing schools. That's why, as President, I will give the parents of every low-income and special-needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school. When it comes to education, a choice for every parent means a chance for every child.
An effective immigration system can also strengthen our economy, as it has since the nation's founding.
Unfortunately, despite his promises, President Obama has failed to address immigration reform.
For two years, this President had huge majorities in the House and Senate – he was free to pursue any policy he pleased. But he did nothing to advance a permanent fix for our broken immigration system. Instead, he failed to act until facing a tough re-election and trying to secure your vote.
Last week, the President finally offered a temporary measure that he seems to think will be just enough to get him through the election. After three and a half years of putting every issue from loan guarantees for his donors to Cash For Clunkers before immigration, now the President has been seized by an overwhelming need to do what he could have done on Day One. I think you deserve better.
Some people have asked if I will let stand the President's executive action. The answer is that I will put in place my own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the President's temporary measure.
As President, I won't settle for a stop-gap measure. I will work with Republicans and Democrats to find a long-term solution. I will prioritize measures that strengthen legal immigration and make it easier. And I will address the problem of illegal immigration in a civil but resolute manner. We may not always agree, but when I make a promise to you, I will keep it.
Let me speak to a few principles that will guide me.
As I have said many times, it is critical that we redouble our efforts to secure the borders. That means both preventing illegal border crossings and making it harder to illegally overstay a visa. We should field enough border patrol agents, complete a high-tech fence, and implement an improved exit verification system.
Our immigration system should help promote strong families, not keep them apart. Our nation benefits when moms and dads and their kids are all living together under the same roof. But, today, too many families are caught in a broken system that costs them time and money and entangles them in red tape. For those seeking to come to America the right way, that kind of bureaucratic nightmare has to end. And we can do this with just a few common-sense reforms.
As President, I will reallocate Green Cards to those seeking to keep their families under one roof. We will exempt from caps the spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents. And we will eliminate other forms of bureaucratic red tape that keep families from being together.
Immigration reform is not just a moral imperative, but an economic necessity as well. Immigrants with advanced degrees start companies, create jobs, and drive innovation at a high rate. Immigrants founded or cofounded nearly half of our 50 top venture-backed companies. They are nearly 30 percent more likely to start a business. And that kind of risk taking is something we need more than ever because new business starts are now at a 30-year low.
I will work with states and employers to update our temporary worker visa program so that it meets our economic needs.
And if you get an advanced degree here, we want you to stay here – so we will staple a green card to your diploma. We want the best and brightest to enrich the nation through the jobs and technologies they will help create.
We also have a strong tradition in this country of honoring immigrants who join our military and put their lives on the line to keep this country safe. Since September 11, 2001, the United States has naturalized almost 75,000 members of the Armed Forces. Too many of these patriots died on distant battlefields for our freedom before receiving full citizenship here in the country they called "home."
As President, I will stand for a path to legal status for anyone who is willing to stand up and defend this great nation through military service. Those who have risked their lives in defense of America have earned the right to make their life in America.
But improving access to legal immigration is only one part of the equation. We must also make legal immigration more attractive than illegal immigration, so that people are rewarded for waiting patiently in line. That's why my administration will establish a strong employment verification system so that every business can know with confidence that the people it hires are legally eligible for employment.
We can find common ground here, and we must. We owe it to ourselves as Americans to ensure that our country remains a land of opportunity – both for those who were born here and for those who share our values, respect our laws, and want to come to our shores.
I've spoken often about how proud I am of my father. He was born to American parents living in Mexico. When he was five, they left everything behind, and started over in the United States.
His dad – my grandfather – was a builder who went bust more than once. My grandfather didn't make much money. There were times in my dad's life when he lived in poverty. But my grandfather had big hopes for my dad, and tried to help him as best he could.
My Dad didn't finish college. But he believed in a country where the circumstances of one's birth were not a barrier to achievement – and he wasn't afraid of hard work. He held odd jobs – lath and plaster and selling paint. He was lucky enough to live in America, where hard work can turn aspirations into realities. And he became the leader of a great car company and the governor of a great state.
This is my father's story – but it could be any American's. Most of you here today are leaders in your community. You are here because you have benefitted from this land of opportunity, and you want to give back to this country, to fight for its people, so that they have the same chance to succeed.
We are truly one America. Everyone here has made this exceptional nation what it is today.
This isn't an election about two people. This isn't an election about being a Republican, Democrat, or an independent. This is an election about the future of America. I would ask each of you to look at the last three and a half years, and ask whether we can do better.
Is the America of 11% Hispanic unemployment the America of our dreams? I know we can do better. We can prosper again, with the powerful recovery we have all been waiting for, the good jobs that so many still need, and, above all, the opportunities we owe to our children and grandchildren.
Thank you all, and God bless America.

Remarks Following The Supreme Court's Decision On President Obama's Healthcare Law

June 28, 2012

"As you might imagine, I disagree with the Supreme Court's decision and I agree with the dissent. What the Court did not do on its last day in session, I will do on my first day if elected President of the United States. And that is I will act to repeal Obamacare.
"Let's make clear that we understand what the Court did and did not do. What the Court did today was say that Obamacare does not violate the Constitution. What they did not do was say that Obamacare is good law or that it's good policy.
"Obamacare was bad policy yesterday. It's bad policy today. Obamacare was bad law yesterday. It's bad law today. Let me tell you why I say that. Obamacare raises taxes on the American people by approximately $500 billion. Obamacare cuts Medicare, cuts Medicare, by approximately $500 billion. And even with those cuts, and tax increases, Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt and pushes those obligations on to coming generations. Obamacare also means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep. Obamacare is a job killer. Businesses across the country have been asked what the impact is of Obamacare. Three quarters of those surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce said Obamacare makes it less likely for them to hire people. And perhaps most troubling of all, Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor.
"For all those reasons, it's important for us to repeal and replace Obamacare. What are some of the things that we'll keep in place, and must be in place, in a reform, a real reform, of our healthcare system? One, we have to make sure that people who want to keep their current insurance will be able to do so. Having 20 million people, up to that number of people, lose the insurance they want, is simply unacceptable. Number two, got to make sure that those people who have pre-existing conditions know that they will be able to be insured and they will not lose their insurance. We also have to assure that we do our very best to help each state in their effort to assure that every American has access to affordable healthcare. And something that Obamacare does not do that must be done in real reform is helping lower the cost of healthcare and health insurance. It's becoming prohibitively expensive.
"And so this is now a time for the American people to make a choice. You can choose whether you want to have a larger and larger government, more and more intrusive in your life—separating you and your doctor—whether you're comfortable with more deficits, higher debt that we pass onto the coming generations. Whether you're willing to have the government put in place a plan that potentially causes you to lose the insurance that you like or whether instead you want to return to a time when the American people will have their own choice in healthcare. Where consumers will be able to make their choices as to what kind of health insurance they want.
"This is the time of choice for the American people. Our mission is clear: If we want to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to have to replace President Obama. My mission is to make sure we do exactly that. That we return to the American people the privilege they've always had to live their lives in the way they feel most appropriate. Where we don't pass on to coming generations massive deficits and debt, where we don't have a setting where jobs are lost. If we want good jobs and a bright economic future, for ourselves and for our kids, we must replace Obamacare. That is my mission. That is our work. And I'm asking the people of America to join me. If you don't want the course that President Obama has put us on, if you want instead a course that the Founders envisioned, then join me in this effort. Help us. Help us defeat Obamacare. Help us defeat the liberal agenda that makes government too big, too intrusive, and is killing jobs across this great country."

Remarks at the NAACP Convention in Houston, Texas

July 11, 2012

Thank you, Bishop Graves, for your generous introduction. Thanks also to President Ben Jealous and Chairman Roslyn Brock for the opportunity to be here this morning, and for your hospitality.  It is an honor to address you.
I appreciate the chance to speak first — even before Vice President Biden gets his turn tomorrow.  I just hope the Obama campaign won't think you're playing favorites.
You all know something of my background, and maybe you've wondered how any Republican ever becomes governor of Massachusetts in the first place.  Well, in a state with 11 percent Republican registration, you don't get there by just talking to Republicans.  We have to make our case to every voter.  We don't count anybody out, and we sure don't make a habit of presuming anyone's support. Support is asked for and earned — and that's why I'm here today.  
With 90 percent of African-Americans voting for Democrats, some of you may wonder why a Republican would bother to campaign in the African American community, and to address the NAACP.  Of course, one reason is that I hope to represent all Americans, of every race, creed or sexual orientation, from the poorest to the richest and everyone in between.
But there is another reason: I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African American families, you would vote for me for president. I want you to know that if I did not believe that my policies and my leadership would help families of color -- and families of any color -- more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I would not be running for president.
The opposition charges that I and people in my party are running for office to help the rich.  Nonsense.  The rich will do just fine whether I am elected or not. The President wants to make this a campaign about blaming the rich. I want to make this a campaign about helping the middle class. 
I am running for president because I know that my policies and vision will help hundreds of millions of middle class Americans of all races, will lift people from poverty, and will help prevent people from becoming poor. My campaign is about helping the people who need help. The course the President has set has not done that — and will not do that. My course will.
When President Obama called to congratulate me on becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, he said that he, "looked forward to an important and healthy debate about America's future."  To date, I'm afraid that his campaign has taken a different course than that.
But, in campaigns at their best, voters can expect a clear choice, and candidates can expect a fair hearing — only more so from a venerable organization like this one. So, it is that healthy debate about the course of the nation that I want to discuss with you today.
If someone had told us in the 1950s or 1960s that a black citizen would serve as the forty-fourth president, we would have been proud and many would have been surprised.  Picturing that day, we might have assumed that the American presidency would be the very last door of opportunity to be opened.  Before that came to pass, every other barrier on the path to equal opportunity would surely have come down.  
Of course, it hasn't happened quite that way.  Many barriers remain.  Old inequities persist.  In some ways, the challenges are even more complicated than before.  And across America -- and even within your own ranks -- there are serious, honest debates about the way forward.  
If equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, then a chronically bad economy would be equally bad for everyone.  Instead, it's worse for African Americans in almost every way.  The unemployment rate, the duration of unemployment, average income, and median family wealth are all worse for the black community. In June, while the overall unemployment rate remained stuck at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate for African Americans actually went up, from 13.6 percent to 14.4 percent.
Americans of every background are asking when this economy will finally recover — and you, in particular, are entitled to an answer.  
If equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, black families could send their sons and daughters to public schools that truly offer the hope of a better life.  Instead, for generations, the African-American community has been waiting and waiting for that promise to be kept.  Today, black children are 17 percent of students nationwide — but they are 42 percent of the students in our worst-performing schools.
Our society sends them into mediocre schools and expects them to perform with excellence, and that is not fair.  Frederick Douglass observed that, "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men."  Yet, instead of preparing these children for life, too many schools set them up for failure. Everyone in this room knows that we owe them better than that.
The path of inequality often leads to lost opportunity. College, graduate school, and first jobs should be milestones marking the passage from childhood to adulthood. But for too many disadvantaged young people, these goals seem unattainable — and their lives take a tragic turn. 
Many live in neighborhoods filled with violence and fear, and empty of opportunity. Their impatience for real change is understandable. They are entitled to feel that life in America should be better than this. They are told even now to wait for improvements in our economy and in our schools, but it seems to me that these Americans have waited long enough.
The point is that when decades of the same promises keep producing the same failures, then it's reasonable to rethink our approach — and consider a new plan.  
I'm hopeful that together we can set a new direction in federal policy, starting where many of our problems do — with the family. A study from the Brookings Institution has shown that for those who graduate from high school, get a full-time job, and wait until 21 before they marry and then have their first child, the probability of being poor is two percent.  And if those factors are absent, the probability of being poor is 76 percent.
Here at the NAACP, you understand the deep and lasting difference the family makes. Your former executive director, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, had it exactly right.  The family, he said, "remains the bulwark and the mainstay of the black community.  That great truth must not be overlooked."
Any policy that lifts up and honors the family is going to be good for the country, and that must be our goal. As President, I will promote strong families — and I will defend traditional marriage.
As you may have heard from my opponent, I am also a believer in the free-enterprise system. I believe it can bring change where so many well-meaning government programs have failed.  I've never heard anyone look around an impoverished neighborhood and say, "You know, there's too much free enterprise around here.  Too many shops, too many jobs, too many people putting money in the bank."
What you hear, of course, is how do we bring in jobs?  How do we make good, honest employers want to move in and stay?  And with the shape this economy is in, we're asking that more than ever.  
Free enterprise is still the greatest force for upward mobility, economic security, and the expansion of the middle class.  We have seen in recent years what it's like to have less free enterprise. As President, I will show the good things that can happen when we have more — more business activity, more jobs, more opportunity, more paychecks, more savings accounts.  
On Day One, I will begin turning this economy around with a plan for the middle class.  And I don't mean just those who are middle class now — I also mean those who have waited so long for their chance to join the middle class.
I know what it will take to put people back to work, to bring more jobs and better wages. My jobs plan is based on 25 years of success in business. It has five key steps.
First, I will take full advantage of our energy resources, and I will approve the Keystone pipeline from Canada. Low cost, plentiful coal, natural gas, oil, and renewables will bring over a million manufacturing jobs back to the United States.
Second, I will open up new markets for American products. We are the most productive major economy in the world, so trade means good jobs for Americans. But trade must be free and fair, so I'll clamp down on cheaters like China and make sure that they finally play by the rules.
Third, I will reduce government spending. Our high level of debt slows GDP growth and that means fewer jobs. If our goal is jobs, we must, must stop spending over a trillion dollars more than we earn. To do this, I will eliminate expensive non-essential programs like Obamacare, and I will work to reform and save Medicare and Social Security, in part by means-testing their benefits. 
Fourth, I will focus on nurturing and developing the skilled workers our economy so desperately needs and the future demands. This is the human capital with which tomorrow's bright future will be built. Too many homes and too many schools are failing to provide our children with the skills and education that are essential for anything other than a minimum-wage job.
And finally and perhaps most importantly, I will restore economic freedom. This nation's economy runs on freedom, on opportunity, on entrepreneurs, on dreamers who innovate and build businesses. These entrepreneurs are being crushed by high taxation, burdensome regulation, hostile regulators, excessive healthcare costs, and destructive labor policies. I will work to make America the best place in the world for innovators and entrepreneurs and businesses small and large. 
Do these five things — open up energy, expand trade, cut the growth of government, focus on better educating tomorrow's workers today, and restore economic freedom — and jobs will come back to America, and wages will rise again. The President will say he will do those things, but he will not, he cannot, and his record of the last four years proves it.
If I am president, job one for me will be creating jobs. I have no hidden agenda. If you want a president who will make things better in the African American community, you are looking at him. 
Finally, I will address the institutionalized inequality in our education system.  And I know something about this from my time as governor.  
In the years before I took office our state's leaders had come together to pass bipartisan measures that were making a difference.  In reading and in math, our students were already among the best in the nation — and during my term, they took over the top spot.  
Those results revealed what good teachers can do if the system will only let them.  The problem was, this success wasn't shared.  A significant achievement gap between students of different races remained.  So we set out to close it.
I urged faster interventions in failing schools, and the funding to go along with it.  I promoted math and science excellence in schools, and proposed paying bonuses to our best teachers.
I refused to weaken testing standards, and instead raised them. To graduate from high school, students had to pass an exam in math and English — I added a science requirement as well. And I put in place a merit scholarship for those students who excelled: the top 25 percent of students in each high school were awarded a John and Abigail Adams Scholarship — which meant four years tuition-free at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. 
When I was governor, not only did test scores improve — we also narrowed the achievement gap.
The teachers unions were not happy with a number of these reforms. They especially did not like our emphasis on choice through charter schools, particularly for our inner city kids. Accordingly, the legislature passed a moratorium on any new charter schools.
As you know, in Boston, in Harlem, in Los Angeles, and all across the country, charter schools are giving children a chance, children that otherwise could be locked in failing schools. I was inspired just a few weeks ago by the students in one of Kenny Gamble's charter schools in Philadelphia.  Right here in Houston is another success story:  the Knowledge Is Power Program, which has set the standard, thanks to the groundbreaking work of the late Harriet Ball. 
These charter schools are doing a lot more than closing the achievement gap.  They are bringing hope and opportunity to places where for years there has been none.  
Charter schools are so successful that almost every politician can find something good to say about them.  But, as we saw in Massachusetts, true reform requires more than talk. As Governor, I vetoed the bill blocking charter schools. But our legislature was 87 percent Democrat, and my veto could have been easily over-ridden. So I joined with the Black Legislative Caucus, and their votes helped preserve my veto, which meant that new charter schools, including some in urban neighborhoods, would be opened. 
When it comes to education reform, candidates cannot have it both ways — talking up education reform, while indulging the same groups that are blocking reform.  You can be the voice of disadvantaged public-school students, or you can be the protector of special interests like the teachers unions, but you can't be both.  I have made my choice: As president, I will be a champion of real education reform in America, and I won't let any special interest get in the way.  
I will give the parents of every low-income and special needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school.  For the first time in history, federal education funds will be linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school, or to a private school, where permitted.  And I will make that a true choice by ensuring there are good options available to all.   
Should I be elected President, I'll lead as I did when I was governor. I am pleased today to be joined today by Reverend Jeffrey Brown, who was a member of my kitchen cabinet in Massachusetts that helped guide my policy and actions that affected the African American community. I will look for support wherever there is good will and shared conviction. I will work with you to help our children attend better schools and help our economy create good jobs with better wages.
I can't promise that you and I will agree on every issue.  But I do promise that your hospitality to me today will be returned.  We will know one another, and work to common purposes.  I will seek your counsel.  And if I am elected president, and you invite me to next year's convention, I would count it as a privilege, and my answer will be yes.  
The Republican Party's record, by the measures you rightly apply, is not perfect.  Any party that claims a perfect record doesn't know history the way you know it.
Yet always, in both parties, there have been men and women of integrity, decency, and humility who called injustice by its name.  For every one of us a particular person comes to mind, someone who set a standard of conduct and made us better by their example.  For me, that man is my father, George Romney.
It wasn't just that my Dad helped write the civil rights provision for the Michigan Constitution, though he did.  It wasn't just that he helped create Michigan's first civil rights commission, or that as governor he marched for civil rights in Detroit — though he did those things, too.  
More than these public acts, it was the kind of man he was, and the way he dealt with every person, black or white.  He was a man of the fairest instincts, and a man of faith who knew that every person was a child of God.
I'm grateful to him for so many things, and above all for the knowledge of God, whose ways are not always our ways, but whose justice is certain and whose mercy endures forever.  
Every good cause on this earth relies in the end on a plan bigger than ours.  "Without dependence on God," as Dr. King said, "our efforts turn to ashes and our sunrises into darkest night.  Unless his spirit pervades our lives, we find only what G. K. Chesterton called 'cures that don't cure, blessings that don't bless, and solutions that don't solve.'"
Of all that you bring to the work of today's civil rights cause, no advantage counts for more than this abiding confidence in the name above every name. Against cruelty, arrogance, and all the foolishness of man, this spirit has carried the NAACP to many victories.  More still are up ahead, and with each one we will be a better nation.  
Thank you, and God bless you all.

Remarks at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention in Reno, Nevada

July 24, 2012

Thank you. Commander Richard DeNoyer, I appreciate the introduction, and I'm proud to see a combat veteran from Massachusetts serving as National Commander of the VFW...
Ladies Auxiliary President Gwen Rankin, incoming National Commander John Hamilton, incoming Ladies Auxiliary President Leanne Lemley, Adjutant General Allen "Gunner" Kent, Executive Director Bob Wallace, distinguished guests and members of the VFW: Thank you for your generous welcome.
I want to start today with a few words about the unimaginable tragedy in Colorado last week. We've since learned that among the victims were four people who had served — or were serving — our country in uniform. Today, our hearts go out to the families of John Larimer of the U.S. Navy; Rebecca Wingo, an Air Force veteran; Jesse Childress, an Army veteran and member of the Air Force reserve; and Jonathan Blunk, a Navy veteran who died shielding his girlfriend from the spray of bullets. The loss of four Americans who served our country only adds to the profound tragedy of that day. All Americans are grateful for their service and deeply saddened by their deaths. We mourn them and we will remember them.
The VFW is now over two million strong. It has a special place in America's heart. Some of you fought recently, in Iraq or Afghanistan. Others are old enough to have marched, flown, or sailed by orders of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Whatever your age, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, whenever you served — there's one thing you have in common: You answered the call of your country in a time of war. From December 7th, 1941 to September 11, 2001, whenever America has been tested, you stepped forward. You come from our farms, our great cities, our small towns and quiet neighborhoods. Many of you have known violence so that your neighbors could only know peace. You have done more than protect America; your courage and service defines America. You are America at our best and it is an honor to address you.
Our veterans are part of a proud tradition that stretches back to the battlefields at Lexington and Concord — and now to places like Fallujah and Kandahar. Year after year, our men and women in uniform have added proud achievements to their record of service. And President Obama pointed to some of them yesterday in his speech.
Any time our military accomplishes a vital mission it is a proud moment for our nation. But we owe our veterans and our military more than just an accounting of our successes. They deserve a fair and frank assessment of the whole picture — of where we are and where we want to be. And when it comes to national security and foreign policy, as with our economy, the last few years have been a time of declining influence and missed opportunity.
Just consider some of the challenges I discussed at your last national convention:
Since then, has the American economy recovered?
Has our ability to shape world events been enhanced, or diminished?
Have we gained greater confidence among our allies, and greater respect from our adversaries?
And, perhaps most importantly, has the most severe security threat facing America and our friends, a nuclear-armed Iran, become more or less likely?
These clear measures are the ultimate tests of American leadership. And, by these standards, we haven't seen much in the President's first term that inspires confidence in a second.
The President's policies have made it harder to recover from the deepest recession in seventy years ... exposed the military to cuts that no one can justify ... compromised our national-security secrets ... and in dealings with other nations, given trust where it is not earned, insult where it is not deserved, and apology where it is not due.
From Berlin to Cairo to the United Nations, President Obama has shared his view of America and its place among nations. I have come here today to share mine.
I am an unapologetic believer in the greatness of this country. I am not ashamed of American power. I take pride that throughout history our power has brought justice where there was tyranny, peace where there was conflict, and hope where there was affliction and despair. I do not view America as just one more point on the strategic map, one more power to be balanced. I believe our country is the greatest force for good the world has ever known, and that our influence is needed as much now as ever. And I am guided by one overwhelming conviction and passion: This century must be an American Century.
In 1941, Henry Luce called on his countrymen — just then realizing their strength — "to create the first great American century." And they succeeded: together with their allies, they won World War II, they rescued Europe, they defeated Communism, and America took its place as leader of the free world. Across the globe, they fought, they bled, they led. They showed the world the extraordinary courage of the American heart and the generosity of the American spirit.
That courage and generosity remains unchanged today. But sadly, this president has diminished American leadership, and we are reaping the consequences. The world is dangerous, destructive, chaotic. And the two men running to be your commander-in-chief must offer their answers to the challenges we face.
Like a watchman in the night, we must remain at our post — and keep guard of the freedom that defines and ennobles us, and our friends. In an American Century, we have the strongest economy and the strongest military in the world. In an American Century, we secure peace through our strength. And if by absolute necessity we must employ it, we must wield our strength with resolve. In an American Century, we lead the free world and the free world leads the entire world.
If we do not have the strength or vision to lead, then other powers will take our place, pulling history in a very different direction. A just and peaceful world depends on a strong and confident America. I pledge to you that if I become commander-in-chief, the United States of America will fulfill its duty, and its destiny.
American leadership depends, as it always has, on our economic strength, on our military strength, and on our moral strength. If any of these falter, no skill of diplomacy or presidential oratory can compensate. Today, the strength of our economy is in jeopardy.
A healthy American economy is what underwrites American power. When growth is missing, government revenue falls, social spending rises, and many in Washington look to cut defense spending as an easy out. That includes our current President.
Today, we are just months away from an arbitrary, across-the-board budget reduction that would saddle the military with a trillion dollars in cuts, severely shrink our force structure, and impair our ability to meet and deter threats. Don't bother trying to find a serious military rationale behind any of this, unless that rationale is wishful thinking. Strategy is not driving President Obama's massive defense cuts. In fact, his own Secretary of Defense warned that these reductions would be "devastating." And he is right.
That devastation starts at home. These cuts would only weaken an already stretched VA system and impair our solemn commitment that every veteran receives care second to none. I will not allow that to happen.
This is not the time for the President's radical cuts in the military. Look around the globe. Other major powers are rapidly adding to their military capabilities, some with intentions very different from ours. The regime in Tehran is drawing closer to developing a nuclear weapon. The threat of radical Islamic terrorism persists. The threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation is ever-present. And we are still at war and still have uniformed men and women in conflict.
All this and more is ongoing in the world. And yet the President has chosen this moment for wholesale reductions in the nation's military capacity. When the biggest announcement in his last State of the Union address on improving our military was that the Pentagon will start using more clean energy — then you know it's time for a change.
We're not the first people to observe this. It is reported that Bob Gates, the President's first secretary of defense, bluntly addressed another security problem within this administration. After secret operational details of the bin Laden raid were given to reporters, Secretary Gates walked into the West Wing and told the Obama team to "shut up." He added a colorful word for emphasis.
Lives of American servicemen and women are at stake. But astonishingly, the administration failed to change its ways. More top-secret operations were leaked, even some involving covert action in Iran.
This isn't a partisan issue; it's a national security crisis. And yesterday, Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, quote, "I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks."
This conduct is contemptible. It betrays our national interest. It compromises our men and women in the field. And it demands a full and prompt investigation by a special counsel, with explanation and consequence. Obama appointees, who are accountable to President Obama's Attorney General, should not be responsible for investigating the leaks coming from the Obama White House.
Whoever provided classified information to the media, seeking political advantage for the administration, must be exposed, dismissed, and punished. The time for stonewalling is over.
It is not enough to say the matter is being looked into, and leave it at that. When the issue is the political use of highly sensitive national security information, it is unacceptable to say, "We'll report our findings after Election Day."
Exactly who in the White House betrayed these secrets? Did a superior authorize it? These are things that Americans are entitled to know — and they are entitled to know right now. If the President believes — as he said last week — that the buck stops with him, then he owes all Americans a full and prompt accounting of the facts.
And let me make this very clear: These events make the decision we face in November all the more important. What kind of White House would reveal classified material for political gain? I'll tell you right now: Mine won't.
The harm done when national security secrets are betrayed extends, of course, to the trust that allies place in the United States.
The operating principle of American foreign policy has been to work with our allies so that we can deter aggression before it breaks out into open conflict. That policy depends on nurturing our alliances and standing up for our common values.
Yet the President has moved in the opposite direction.
It began with the sudden abandonment of friends in Poland and the Czech Republic. They had courageously agreed to provide sites for our anti-missile systems, only to be told, at the last hour, that the agreement was off. As part of the so-called reset in policy, missile defenses were sacrificed as a unilateral concession to the Russian government.
If that gesture was designed to inspire good will from Russia, it clearly missed the mark. The Russian government defended the dictator in Damascus, arming him as he slaughtered the Syrian people.
We can only guess what Vladimir Putin makes of the Obama administration. He regained the Russian presidency in a corrupt election, and for that, he got a congratulatory call from the Oval Office. And then there was that exchange picked up by a microphone that President Obama didn't know was on. We heard him asking Dmitry Medvedev to tell Mr. Putin to give him "space." "This is my last election," President Obama said, and "After my election I'll have more flexibility."
Why is flexibility with Russian leaders more important than transparency to the American people?
President Obama had a moment of candor, however, just the other day. He said that the actions of the Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez have not had a serious national security impact on us. In my view, inviting Hezbollah into our hemisphere is severe, serious, and a threat.
But at least he was consistent. After all, this is the president who faltered when the Iranian people were looking for support in their struggle against the ayatollahs. That uprising was treated as an inconvenient problem for the President's policy of engagement, instead of as a moral and strategic opportunity. That terrible misjudgment should never be repeated. When unarmed women and men in Tehran find the courage to confront their oppressors, at risk of torture and death, they should hear the unequivocal voice of an American president affirming their right to be free.
I will leave Reno this evening on a trip abroad that will take me to England, Poland, and Israel. And since I wouldn't venture into another country to question American foreign policy, I will tell you right here — before I leave — what I think of this administration's shabby treatment of one of our finest friends.
President Obama is fond of lecturing Israel's leaders. He was even caught by a microphone deriding them. He has undermined their position, which was tough enough as it was. And even at the United Nations, to the enthusiastic applause of Israel's enemies, he spoke as if our closest ally in the Middle East was the problem.
The people of Israel deserve better than what they have received from the leader of the free world. And the chorus of accusations, threats, and insults at the United Nations should never again include the voice of the President of the United States.
There are values, causes, and nations that depend on American strength, on the clarity of our purpose, and on the reliability of our commitments. There is work in this world that only America and our allies can do, hostile powers that only we can deter, and challenges that only we can overcome.
For the past decade, among those challenges has been the war in Afghanistan. As commander-in-chief, I will have a solemn duty to our men and women in uniform. A president owes our troops, their families, and the American people a clear explanation of our mission, and a commitment not to play politics with the decisions of war.
I have been critical of the President's decision to withdraw the surge troops during the fighting season, against the advice of the commanders on the ground. President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war — and to potential attacks here at home — is a politically timed retreat.
As president, my goal in Afghanistan will be to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. I will evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation.
We face another continuing challenge in a rising China. China is attentive to the interests of its government — but it too often disregards the rights of its people. It is selective in the freedoms it allows; and, as with its one-child policy, it can be ruthless in crushing the freedoms it denies. In conducting trade with America, it permits flagrant patent and copyright violations ... forestalls American businesses from competing in its market ... and manipulates its currency to obtain unfair advantage. It is in our mutual interest for China to be a partner for a stable and secure world, and we welcome its participation in trade. But the cheating must finally be brought to a stop. President Obama hasn't done it and won't do it. I will.
We'll need that same clarity of purpose and resolve in the Middle East. America cannot be neutral in the outcome there. We must clearly stand for the values of representative government, economic opportunity, and human rights. And we must stand against the extension of Iranian or jihadist influence.
Egypt is at the center of this historical drama. In many ways, it has the power to tip the balance in the Arab world toward freedom and modernity. As president, I will not only direct the billions in assistance we give to Egypt toward that goal, but I will also work with partner nations to place conditions on their assistance as well. Unifying our collective influence behind a common purpose will foster the development of a government that represents all Egyptians, maintains peace with Israel, and promotes peace throughout the region. The United States is willing to help Egypt support peace and prosperity, but we will not be complicit in oppression and instability.
There is no greater danger in the world today than the prospect of the ayatollahs in Tehran possessing nuclear weapons capability. Yet for all the talks and conferences, all of the extensions and assurances, can anyone say we are farther from this danger now than four years ago?
The same ayatollahs who each year mark a holiday by leading chants of "Death to America" are not going to be talked out of their pursuit of nuclear weapons. What's needed is all the firmness, clarity, and moral courage that we and our allies can gather. Sanctions must be enforced without exception, cutting off the regime's sources of wealth. Negotiations must secure full and unhindered access for inspections. As it is, the Iranian regime claims the right to enrich nuclear material for supposedly peaceful purposes. This claim is discredited by years of deception. A clear line must be drawn: There must be a full suspension of any enrichment, period.
And at every turn, Iran must know that the United States and our allies stand as one in these critical objectives. Only in this way can we successfully counter the catastrophic threat that Iran presents. I pledge to you and to all Americans that if I become commander-in-chief, I will use every means necessary to protect ourselves and the region, and to prevent the worst from happening while there is still time.
It is a mistake — and sometimes a tragic one — to think that firmness in American foreign policy can bring only tension or conflict. The surest path to danger is always weakness and indecision. In the end, it is resolve that moves events in our direction, and strength that keeps the peace.
I will not surrender America's leadership in the world. We must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose, and resolve in our might.
This is very simple: if you do not want America to be the strongest nation on earth, I am not your President. You have that President today.
The 21st century can and must be an American Century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.
Fewer members of the Greatest Generation are with us today — and they can't hold the torch as high as they have in the past. We must now seize the torch they carried so gallantly and at such sacrifice. It is an eternal torch of decency, freedom and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty — and honor — to hold it high enough so that all the world can see its light.
Believe in America.
Thank you and God Bless the United States of America.

Remarks to the Jerusalem Foundation in Jerusalem, Israel

July 29, 2012

Thank you for that kind introduction, Mayor Barkat, and thank you all for that warm welcome.  It's a pleasure and a privilege to be in Israel again.  
To step foot into Israel is to step foot into a nation that began with an ancient promise made in this land. The Jewish people persisted through one of the most monstrous crimes in human history, and now this nation has come to take its place among the most impressive democracies on earth. Israel's achievements are a wonder of the modern world. 
These achievements are a tribute to the resilience of the Israeli people.  You have managed, against all odds, time and again throughout your history, to persevere, to rise up, and to emerge stronger.
The historian Paul Johnson, writing on the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Jewish state, said that over the course of Israel's life, 100 completely new independent states had come into existence. "Israel is the only one whose creation can fairly be called a miracle," Johnson wrote.
It is a deeply moving experience to be in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.
Our two nations are separated by more than 5,000 miles. But for an American abroad, you can't get much closer to the ideals and convictions of my own country than you do in Israel.  We're part of the great fellowship of democracies.  We speak the same language of freedom and justice, and the right of every person to live in peace.  We serve the same cause and provoke the same hatreds in the same enemies of civilization.
It is my firm conviction that the security of Israel is in the vital national security interest of the United States. And ours is an alliance based not only on shared interests but also on enduring shared values.
In those shared values, one of the strongest voices is that of your prime minister, my friend Benjamin Netanyahu.  I met with him earlier this morning and I look forward to my family joining his this evening as they observe the close of this fast day of Tisha B'Av.
It's remarkable to consider how much adversity, over so great a span of time, is recalled by just one day on the calendar.  This is a day of remembrance and mourning, but like other such occasions, it also calls forth clarity and resolve.
At this time, we also remember the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches who were massacred at the Munich Olympics forty years ago. Ten years ago this week, 9 Israeli and American students were murdered in the terrorist attack at Hebrew University. And tragedies like these are not reserved to the past. They are a constant reminder of the reality of hate, and the will with which it is executed upon the innocent.
It was Menachem Begin who said this about the Ninth of the month of Av:  "We remember that day," he said, "and now have the responsibility to make sure that never again will our independence be destroyed and never again will the Jew become homeless or defenseless." "This," Prime Minister Begin added, "is the crux of the problems facing us in the future."
So it is today, as Israel faces enemies who deny past crimes against the Jewish people and seek to commit new ones. 
When Iran's leaders deny the Holocaust or speak of wiping this nation off the map, only the naпve — or worse — will dismiss it as an excess of rhetoric.  Make no mistake: the ayatollahs in Tehran are testing our moral defenses.  They want to know who will object, and who will look the other way.
My message to the people of Israel and the leaders of Iran is one and the same: I will not look away; and neither will my country. As Prime Minister Begin put it, in vivid and haunting words, "if an enemy of [the Jewish] people says he seeks to destroy us, believe him."
We have seen the horrors of history.  We will not stand by.  We will not watch them play out again.
It would be foolish not to take Iran's leaders at their word. They are, after all, the product of a radical theocracy. 
Over the years Iran has amassed a bloody and brutal record. It has seized embassies, targeted diplomats, and killed its own people. It supports the ruthless Assad regime in Syria. They have provided weapons that have killed American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. It has plotted to assassinate diplomats on American soil.  It is Iran that is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and the most destabilizing nation in the world.
We have a solemn duty and a moral imperative to deny Iran's leaders the means to follow through on their malevolent intentions.
We should stand with all who would join our effort to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran — and that includes Iranian dissidents. Do not erase from your memory the scenes from three years ago, when that regime brought death to its own people as they rose up. The threat we face does not come from the Iranian people, but from the regime that oppresses them.
Five years ago, at the Herzliya Conference, I stated my view that Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability presents an intolerable threat to Israel, to America, and to the world.
That threat has only become worse.  
Now as then, the regime's claims that it seeks to enrich nuclear material for peaceful purposes are belied by years of malign deceptions.
Now as then, the conduct of Iran's leaders gives us no reason to trust them with nuclear material.
But today, the regime in Iran is five years closer to developing nuclear weapons capability.  Preventing that outcome must be our highest national security priority.
I want to pause on this last point. It is sometimes said that those who are the most committed to stopping the Iranian regime from securing nuclear weapons are reckless and provocative and inviting war.
The opposite is true. We are the true peacemakers. History teaches with force and clarity that when the world's most despotic regimes secure the world's most destructive weapons, peace often gives way to oppression, to violence, or to devastating war.
We must not delude ourselves into thinking that containment is an option. We must lead the effort to prevent Iran from building and possessing nuclear weapons capability. We should employ any and all measures to dissuade the Iranian regime from its nuclear course, and it is our fervent hope that diplomatic and economic measures will do so. In the final analysis, of course, no option should be excluded. We recognize Israel's right to defend itself, and that it is right for America to stand with you.
These are some of the principles I first outlined five years ago. What was timely then has become urgent today.
Let me turn from Iran to other nations in the Middle East, where we have seen rising tumult and chaos. To the north, Syria is on the brink of a civil war.  The dictator in Damascus, no friend to Israel and no friend to America, slaughters his own people as he desperately clings to power.
Your other neighbor to the north, Lebanon, is under the growing and dangerous influence of Hezbollah.
After a year of upheaval and unrest, Egypt now has an Islamist President, chosen in a democratic election. Hopefully, this new government understands that one true measure of democracy is how those elected by the majority respect the rights of those in the minority.  The international community must use its considerable influence to ensure that the new government honors the peace agreement with Israel that was signed by the government of Anwar Sadat.
As you know only too well, since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, thousands of rockets have rained on Israeli homes and cities.  I have walked on the streets of Sderot, and honor the resolve of its people. And now, new attacks have been launched from the Sinai Peninsula.
With Hezbollah rockets aimed at Israel from the north, and Hamas rockets aimed from the south, with much of the Middle East in tumult, and with Iran bent on nuclear arms, America's vocal and demonstrated commitment to the defense of Israel is even more critical. Whenever the security of Israel is most in doubt, America's commitment to Israel must be most secure.
When the decision was before him in 1948, President Harry Truman decided without hesitation that the United States would be the first country to recognize the State of Israel.  From that moment to this, we have been the most natural of allies, but our alliance runs deeper than the designs of strategy or the weighing of interests.
The story of how America — a nation still so new to the world by the standards of this ancient region — rose up to become the dear friend of the people of Israel is among the finest and most hopeful in our nation's history. 
Different as our paths have been, we see the same qualities in one another. Israel and America are in many respects reflections of one another.
We both believe in democracy, in the right of every people to select their leaders and choose their nation's course.
We both believe in the rule of law, knowing that in its absence, willful men may incline to oppress the weak. 
We both believe that our rights are universal, granted not by government but by our Creator. 
We both believe in free enterprise, because it is the only economic system that has lifted people from poverty, created a large and enduring middle class, and inaugurated incomparable achievements and human flourishing.
As someone who has spent most of his life in business, I am particularly impressed with Israel's cutting edge technologies and thriving economy.  We recognize yours as the "start-up nation" — and the evidence is all around us. 
You have embraced economic liberty.  You export technology, not tyranny or terrorism.  And today, your innovators and entrepreneurs have made the desert bloom and have made for a better world.  The citizens of our countries are fortunate to share in the rewards of economic freedom and in the creativity of our entrepreneurs. What you have built here, with your own hands, is a tribute to your people, and a model for others.
Finally, we both believe in freedom of expression, because we are confident in our ideas and in the ability of men and women to think for themselves.  We do not fear open debate. If you want to hear some very sharp criticisms of Israel and its policies, you don't have to cross any borders.  All you have to do is walk down the street and into a cafй, where you'll hear people reasoning, arguing, and speaking their mind. Or pick up an Israeli newspaper — you'll find some of the toughest criticism of Israel you'll read anywhere. Your nation, like ours, is stronger for this energetic exchange of ideas and opinions.
That is the way it is in a free society. There are many millions of people in the Middle East who would cherish the opportunity to do the same.  These decent men and women desire nothing more than to live in peace and freedom and to have the opportunity to not only choose their government but to criticize it openly, without fear of repression or repercussion.
I believe that those who oppose these fundamental rights are on the wrong side of history. But history's march can be ponderous and painfully slow. We have a duty to speed and shape history by being unapologetic ambassadors for the values we share.
The United States and Israel have shown that we can build strong economies and strong militaries. But we must also build strong arguments that advance our values and promote peace. We must work together to change hearts and awaken minds through the power of freedom, free enterprise and human rights.
I believe that the enduring alliance between the State of Israel and the United States of America is more than a strategic alliance: it is a force for good in the world. America's support of Israel should make every American proud. We should not allow the inevitable complexities of modern geopolitics to obscure fundamental touchstones. No country or organization or individual should ever doubt this basic truth:  A free and strong America will always stand with a free and strong Israel.
And standing by Israel does not mean with military and intelligence cooperation alone. 
We cannot stand silent as those who seek to undermine Israel, voice their criticisms.  And we certainly should not join in that criticism. Diplomatic distance in public between our nations emboldens Israel's adversaries.
By history and by conviction, our two countries are bound together.  No individual, no nation, no world organization, will pry us apart. And as long as we stay together and stand together, there is no threat we cannot overcome and very little that we cannot achieve.
Thank you all.  May God bless America, and may He bless and protect the Nation of Israel.

Remarks in Warsaw, Poland: "Freedom And Friendship"

July 31, 2012

Thank you all very much for the warm welcome to this great city.
It has been a privilege to meet with President Komorowski, Prime Minister Tusk, Foreign Minister Sikorski, and Former President Walesa.
This is a nation with an extraordinary heritage that is crafting a remarkable future. At a time of widespread economic slowdown and stagnation, your economy last year outperformed all other nations in Europe.
I began this trip in Britain and end it here in Poland: the two bookends of NATO, history's greatest military alliance that has kept the peace for over half a century. While at 10 Downing Street I thought back to the days of Winston Churchill, the man who first spoke of the Iron Curtain that had descended across Europe. What an honor to stand in Poland, among the men and women who helped lift that curtain.
After that stay in England, I visited the State of Israel - a friend of your country and mine. It's been a trip to three places far apart on the map. But for an American, you can't get much closer to the ideals and convictions of my own country. Our nations belong to the great fellowship of democracies. We speak the same language of freedom and justice. We uphold the right of every person to live in peace.
I believe it is critical to stand by those who have stood by America. Solidarity was a great movement that freed a nation. And it is with solidarity that America and Poland face the future.
Yesterday, I saw the memorial at Westerplatte and the gate at the Gdansk Shipyard, where Polish citizens stood with courage and determination against daunting odds. And today, on the eve of the 68th anniversary of this city's uprising against the Nazis, I will pay tribute at the monument to that historic struggle. Over 200,000 Poles were killed in those weeks, and this city was nearly destroyed. But your enduring spirit survived.
Free men and women everywhere, whether they have been here or not, already know this about Poland: In some desperate hours of the last century, your people were the witnesses to hope, led onward by strength of heart and faith in God. Not only by force of arms, but by the power of truth, in villages and parishes across this land, you shamed the oppressor and gave light to the darkness.
Time and again, history has recorded the ascent of liberty, propelled by souls that yearn for freedom and justice. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has noted that it is often one brave man or woman who says "no" to oppression, and in doing so, sparks a revolution of courage in hundreds, thousands or millions of others.
In 1955, in my country, Rosa Parks said "no" to a bus driver who told her to give up her seat to a white person, and in doing so, started a revolution of dignity and equality that continues to this day. Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor in Tunisia, was denied his business wares by a government functionary, and in protest committed suicide by self-immolation. With that act of defiance, the Arab Spring was born.
Nicolai Ceausescu stood before an audience of 200,000, recounting for them his supposed works on their behalf. One elderly woman shouted out what others only thought. "Liar," she said. Others echoed her, first hundreds, then thousands. And with the fall of Ceausescu days later, the entire nation had awoken and a people were freed.
And here, in 1979, a son of Poland, Pope John Paul the Second, spoke words that would bring down an empire and bring freedom to millions who lived in bondage. "Be not afraid" - those words changed the world.
I, and my fellow Americans, are inspired by the path of freedom tread by the people of Poland.
Long before modern times, of course, the Polish and American people were hardly strangers. The name "Pulaski" is honored to this day in America, and so is the memory of other Poles who joined in our fight for independence. Two years after our young republic gave the New World its first freely adopted written constitution. Poland did the same for the Old World, with a preamble that called liberty "dearer than life."
At every turn in our history, through wars and crises, through every change in the geopolitical map, we have met as friends and allies. That was true in America's Revolutionary War. It was true in the dark days of World War II. And it has been true in Iraq and Afghanistan. There has never been a moment when our peoples felt anything but mutual respect and good will - and that is not common in history.
Americans watched with astonishment and admiration, as an electrician led a peaceful protest against a brutal and oppressive regime.
"It has to be understood," as President Walesa has recently said, "that the solidarity movement philosophy was very simple. When you can't lift a weight, you ask someone else for help and to lift it with you."
Of course, among the millions of Poles who said "yes", there was one who has a unique and special place in our hearts: Pope John Paul the Second. When he first appeared on the balcony above Saint Peter's Square, a correspondent on the scene wrote to his editor with a first impression. This is not just a pope from Poland, he said, "This is a pope from Galilee."
In 1979, Pope John Paul the Second celebrated Mass with you in a square not too far from here. He reminded the world there would be no justice in Europe without an independent Poland, and he reminded the Polish people, long deprived of their independence, from where they drew their strength.
While greeting a crowd huddled along a fence, he met a little girl. He paused and asked her, "Where is Poland?" But the girl - caught off guard - couldn't answer. She laughed nervously until the great pope put his hand over her heart and said: "Poland is here."
John Paul the Second understood that a nation is not a flag or a plot of land. It is a people - a community of values. And the highest value Poland honors - to the world's great fortune - is man's innate desire to be free.
Unfortunately, there are parts of the world today where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression: Just to the east of here, the people of Belarus suffer under the oppressive weight of dictatorship. The Arab world is undergoing a historic upheaval, one that holds promise, but also risk and uncertainty. A ruthless dictator in Syria has killed thousands of his own people. In Latin America, Hugo Chavez leads a movement characterized by authoritarianism and repression. Nations in Africa are fighting to resist the threat of violent radical jihadism. And in Russia, once-promising advances toward a free and open society have faltered.
In a turbulent world, Poland stands as an example and defender of freedom.
Only last month, in Gdansk, a sculpture was unveiled of President Reagan and John Paul the Second. As President Walesa told a reporter, "Reagan should have a monument in every city."
Czeslaw Nowak, recalled the days in 1981 when he, Walesa, and others were imprisoned by the communist regime. Just when it felt like they might be forgotten by the world, the captives learned that in the White House, the President of the United States was lighting candles. It was a demonstration of unity with them - a sign of solidarity. "When Reagan lit the candles," Mr. Nowak recalled, "we knew we had a friend in the United States."
This is a country that made a prisoner a president ... that went from foreign domination to the proud and independent nation you are today. And now, for both our nations, the challenge is to be worthy of this legacy as we find a way forward. The false gods of the all-powerful state claim the allegiance of a lonely few. It is for us, in this generation and beyond, to show all the world what free people and free economies can achieve for the good of all.
Perhaps because here in Poland centralized control is no distant memory, you have brought a special determination to securing a free and prosperous economy. When the Soviet Empire breathed its last, Poland's economy was in a state of perpetual crisis. When economists analyzed it from abroad, one heard talk of the prospect of starvation in major cities.
But from the depths of those dark times, this nation's steady rise is a shining example of the prosperity that economic opportunity can bring. Your nation has moved from a state monopoly over the economy, price controls, and severe trade restrictions to a culture of entrepreneurship, greater fiscal responsibility, and international trade. As a result, your economy has experienced positive growth in each of the last twenty years. In that time, you have doubled the size of your economy. The private sector has gone from a mere 15 percent of the economy to 65 percent. And while other nations fell into recession in recent years, you weathered the storm and continued to flourish.
When economists speak of Poland today, it is not to lament chronic problems, but to describe how this nation empowered the individual, lifted the heavy hand of government, and became the fastest-growing economy in all of Europe.
Yesterday, one of your leaders shared with me an economic truth that has been lost in much of the world: "It is simple. You don't borrow what you cannot pay back."
The world should pay close attention to the transformation of Poland's economy. A march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards, a strong military that defends liberty at home and abroad, and an important and growing role on the international stage.
Rather than heeding the false promise of a government-dominated economy, Poland sought to stimulate innovation, attract investment, expand trade, and live within its means. Your success today is a reminder that the principles of free enterprise can propel an economy and transform a society.
At a time of such difficulty and doubt throughout Europe, Poland's economic transformation over these past 20 years is a fitting turn in the story of your country. In the 1980s, when other nations doubted that political tyranny could ever be faced down or overcome, the answer was, "Look to Poland." And today, as some wonder about the way forward out of economic recession and fiscal crisis, the answer once again is "Look to Poland".
It is not surprising that a people who waited so long, and endured so much, for the sake of liberty, are today enjoying liberty to the fullest.
Poland has no greater friend and ally than the people of the United States.
You helped us win our independence... your bravery inspired the allies in the Second World War... you helped bring down the Iron Curtain... and your soldiers fought side-by-side with ours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
We have fought and died together.
We share a common cause, tested by time, inseparable by foe.
In times of trouble and in times of peace, we march together.
God bless you, God bless America, and God bless the great nation of Poland.

Remarks Introducing Representative Paul Ryan as the 2012 Republican Vice Presidential Nominee in Norfolk, Virginia

August 11, 2012

Ladies and gentlemen:
It's great to be back in Virginia and here in Norfolk. Your city's beauty is only matched by its proud heritage as a defender of freedom. Today we take another step forward in helping restore the promise of America. As we move forward in this campaign and on to help lead the nation to better days, it is an honor to announce my running mate and the next Vice President of the United States: Paul Ryan.
Paul Ryan is a leader.
His leadership begins with character and values. And Paul is a man of tremendous character, shaped in large part by his early life.
Paul's father died when he was in high school. That forced him to grow up earlier than any young man should. But Paul did, with the help of his devoted mother, his brothers and sister, and a supportive community. And as he did, he internalized the virtues and hard-working ethic of the Midwest.
Paul Ryan works in Washington – but his beliefs remain firmly rooted in Janesville, Wisconsin. He is a person of great steadiness, whose integrity is unquestioned and whose word is good.
Paul's upbringing is obvious in how he has conducted himself throughout his life, including his leadership in Washington.
In a city that is far too often characterized by pettiness and personal attacks, Paul Ryan is a shining exception. He does not demonize his opponents. He understands that honorable people can have honest differences. And he appeals to the better angels of our nature. There are a lot of people in the other party who might disagree with Paul Ryan; I don't know of anyone who doesn't respect his character and judgment.
Paul is in public life for all the right reasons – not to advance his personal ambitions but to advance the ideals of freedom and justice; and to increase opportunity and prosperity to people of every class and faith, every age and ethnic background. A faithful Catholic, Paul believes in the worth and dignity of every human life.
With energy and vision, Paul Ryan has become an intellectual leader of the Republican Party. He understands the fiscal challenges facing America: our exploding deficits and crushing debt – and the fiscal catastrophe that awaits us if we don't change course.
Paul Ryan combines a profound sense of responsibility for what we owe the next generation with an unbounded optimism in America's future and an understanding of all the wonderful things the American people can do.
Paul also combines firm principles with a practical concern for getting things done. He has never been content to simply curse the darkness; he would rather light candles. And throughout his legislative career he's shown the ability to work with members of both parties to find common ground on some of the hardest issues confronting the American people.
Paul and I are beginning on a journey that will take us to every corner of America. We are offering a positive, governing agenda that will lead to economic growth, to widespread and shared prosperity, and that will improve the lives of our fellow citizens. Our Plan to Strengthen The Middle Class will get America back to work and get our country back on track.
We offer solutions that are bold, specific, and achievable. We offer our commitment to help create 12 million new jobs and to bring better take home pay to middle class families.
To strengthen the middle class, we will provide our workers and our children with the skills to succeed. We'll cut the deficit, have trade that works for America, and champion small business. And finally, we will unleash our energy resources to achieve North American energy independence.
We will help care for those who cannot care for themselves, and we will return work to welfare. As poverty has risen to historic and tragic levels, with nearly one out of six Americans now having fallen into poverty, we will act to bring these families into the middle class. Unlike the current president who has cut Medicare funding by $700 billion, we will preserve and protect Medicare and Social Security. Under the current president, healthcare has only become more expensive. We will reform healthcare so that more Americans have access to affordable healthcare, and we will get that started by repealing and replacing Obamacare.
And at a time when the President's campaign is taking American politics to new lows, we are going to do things differently. We are going to talk about aspirations and American ideals; about bringing people together to solve the urgent problems facing our nation. And when that message wins in America, it will be a victory for every American.
Today is a good day for America. And there are better days ahead. Join me in welcoming the next Vice President of the United States - Paul Ryan.

Remarks In Chillicothe, Ohio

August 14, 2012

Thank you, Ohio.  It's good to be back in the Buckeye State.  And it's a privilege to be here with two good friends - your great governor, John Kasich and your outstanding senator, Rob Portman.  Governor Kasich is doing a great job despite the head winds from Washington. As President, I can't wait to work with Senator Portman to turn those Obama headwinds into pro-job policies that will help working families all across Ohio.
Tonight, we're wrapping up our five-state bus tour to towns big and small. That trip reconfirmed to me just how important this election is — and why we need to change the direction of the country by changing the current occupant of the Oval Office.
We started out on the decks of a battleship in Norfolk, Virginia, where arbitrary and reckless defense cuts threaten our national security and 150,000 jobs.  From there it was on to North Carolina, through towns that have lost thousands and thousands of manufacturing jobs.  And yesterday we were in Florida, where families are still struggling with the Obama Economy.
The people I met on this tour — and the thousands of Americans I've visited in break rooms and lunch rooms, in school gymnasiums and on factory floors — are worried about their children, their jobs, their mortgages, and their future. And they are right to be worried.
All across the country, I've met people who are hurting. Some have lost their jobs; others work two jobs just to get by. Some have fallen out of the middle class and now they're struggling to get back to where they started. The cost of living keeps going up, and they're living paycheck to paycheck.
They are tired of being tired.
And tonight, I'd like to say to each of them:  You have not been forgotten. We will not leave you behind. This is America. We are Americans. It doesn't have to be this way!
Unemployment has been above 8 percent for 42 straight months. We will put Americans back to work!
Half of recent college graduates can't find work or a job that matches their skills.  We'll get good jobs for our kids.
Nearly one out of six Americans are in poverty today. This is a disgrace we will end.
And President Obama has amassed five trillion dollars of debt - nearly as much debt held by the public as all other Presidents combined. We will end this moral failure.
After four years, it's clear that President Obama's policies aren't fixing these problems, they're making them worse. That is why Ohio will lead the way by electing a new President on November 6th.
For the first time, most Americans believe that our best days are behind us. This is an election in which we should be talking about the path ahead, but you don't hear any answers coming from President Obama's re-election campaign. That's because he's intellectually exhausted, out of ideas, and out of energy. And so his campaign has resorted to diversions and distractions, to demagoguing and defaming others. This is an old game in politics; what's different this year is that the president is taking things to a new low.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
In 2008, Candidate Obama said, "if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters."  He said, "if you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from."  And that, he told us, is how, "You make a big election about small things."
That was Candidate Obama describing the strategy that is the now the heart of his campaign.   
His campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the Presidency.  Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia. And the White House sinks a little bit lower.
This is what an angry and desperate Presidency looks like.
President Obama knows better, promised better and America deserves better.
Over the last four years, this President has pushed Republicans and Democrats as far apart as they can go.  And now he and his allies are pushing us all even further apart by dividing us into groups. He demonizes some. He panders to others. His campaign strategy is to smash America apart and then cobble together 51 percent of the pieces.  
If an American president wins that way, we all lose.
But he won't win that way. America is one Nation under God. American history has been a story of the many becoming one - uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness. Everywhere I go in America there are monuments that list those who have given their lives. There is no mention of their race, their party affiliation or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag fighting for a single purpose. They pledged allegiance to the United States of America. So, Mr. President, take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago and let us get about rebuilding and reuniting America.
This election is about restoring the promise of America. It's a choice between two visions for our nation's future. It's about the challenges America faces. It is about a better tomorrow and a better future.      
We don't need more excuses. We don't need more blame. We don't need more small-minded attacks.
What we really need is a new president.
Voters deserve an honest debate. And that's what Paul Ryan and I will give them.
Paul and I have a positive agenda that will lead to economic growth, to widespread and shared prosperity that will improve the lives of our fellow citizens. Our Plan For A Stronger Middle Class will get America back to work and get our country back on track.
We are offering solutions that are bold, specific, and achievable. We're committed to helping create 12 million new jobs and to bring better take-home pay to middle class families.  
My plan focuses on five things.
First, energy independence. We will achieve North America energy independence by 2020, by taking full advantage of our oil, our gas, our coal, our renewables and our nuclear power.  Abundant, inexpensive, domestic energy will not only create energy jobs, it will bring back manufacturing jobs.
Second, we must give our workers and our children the skills they need to succeed. Our nation cannot continue to fail in public education. For too long, we have let the agenda of union bosses steer the agenda of our schools. It is time to put our kids and their parents and their teachers first, and the union bosses behind.
Third, trade must work for America. We are one of the world's most productive nations. Trade creates jobs and raises take-home pay for American workers. We must open more doors for trade in Latin America, where there is a growing middle class. But when any nation cheats, as China has cheated, we must make sure that there are clear and compelling consequences.
Fourth, we will do what politicians in both parties have been promising for years, but have failed to do. We will cut spending, shrink deficits, and put America on track to a balanced budget.
Fifth, we will champion small business. Unlike President Obama, I won't raise taxes on small business. I'll make sure regulators protect the public, but that they stop killing our jobs. I will remove the crippling uncertainty that is preventing businesses from hiring.
That begins by repealing Obamacare.  It's bad for jobs and it's bad for seniors. If the President is re-elected, he will succeed in raiding $716 billion from Medicare -- from the trust fund you have paid into all your lives — to pay for Obamacare. He is taking your money to finance his risky and unproven takeover of the health-care system. He is putting Medicare at greater risk. He is putting health care at greater risk. He is putting your jobs at greater risk.  We must not let Obamacare happen.
If we focus on these five areas — energy, education, trade, deficits, and championing small business — America's economy will come roaring back to life.  And we will finally see a comeback for America's middle class.
My plan is based on proven principles that will produce real results.  I spent 25 years in business, and I know what it takes for the private sector to create jobs.  I know why jobs go away, what it takes to bring them back, and what we must do to make America the best place in the world for entrepreneurs and innovators and job creators. My five-point plan will bring more jobs and more take-home pay for middle-class Americans.
People ask me why I think the President's policies have been such a disappointment. I just don't think President Obama understands what it is that drives our economy.
America runs on freedom. Free men and women, pursuing their dreams, working hard to build a better future for their families. This is what propels our economy. When an American succeeds, when she wins a promotion, when he creates a business, it is that individual, that American that has earned it, that has built it. Government does not build our businesses, the American people do.
The American people also build the government. We pay for it with our taxes. We choose who will lead us with our votes.
Do you want a president who believes that your rights come from God, not from government?
Do you want a president who honors your right to pursue happiness, not as government commands, but as you choose?
Do you want a president who will work every day to bring us together, not tear us apart?
Do you want a president who will celebrate success, not attack it?
Do you want a president who will never, ever apologize for the greatest nation on earth?
With your support, I will be that President.
We are 84 days away from the start of the better future we deserve.
We need new leadership, and new ideas, and a new approach — because four years of failure is enough.                        
Paul Ryan and I believe in America — and in this election, we're offering Americans a clear and honest choice. Every single day we're going to do our part. And we need you to do yours.
I commit to you that I will be the President that this moment demands. I will work to strengthen our families, to rebuild our economy and to keep our military second to none in the world.
I ask you to commit like never before over the next 84 days. This election can come down to just one more vote. I ask you find that vote. Ask one more person to join our campaign. Ask one more person to join us who supported President Obama four years ago and didn't get the change they deserved. One more vote can make the difference in Ohio. And Ohio will make the difference for America.
Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.

Remarks with Paul Ryan at a Republican National Convention Farewell Victory Rally in Lakeland, Florida

August 31, 2012

RYAN: Hey, everybody. Aw, thank you so much. This fan feels good. [chuckles]
[cheers] Thanks. Thank you so much for coming out to our send-off. What a great convention, huh? [cheers and applause] Man!
Florida, thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality. We couldn't have done it without you.
I just want to take a brief moment. An earthquake hit off the coast of the Philippines earlier today. So let's put the people of the Philippines in our prayers at this moment because we're worried about a tsunami. We've seen people in our own country in the path of a storm in Louisiana. So let's just put our — our prayers where they need to be, for the Philippines and for the people who are in the — in the path of Isaac's wake.
And let me now say this. Coming out of Tampa, we have given our fellow countrymen a very clear choice. [cheers] We can either stay on the path that America has been placed upon by President Obama, a path of debt, a path of doubt, a path of decline — [booing] — or we can get people back to work. [cheers] We can restore in this economy and opportunity in our society, and the way we do that is we elect this man, Mitt Romney, the next president of the United States! [cheers and applause]
President Obama made a whole bunch of promises when he ran for president, and now we see a laundry list of broken promises. Twenty-three million people are struggling to find work today. The unemployment rate in Florida is 8.8 percent!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: All right!
REP. RYAN: Foreclosures, houses underwater, the highest poverty rates in a generation.
Half of all college graduates are either unemployed or are not working in the field that they studied for. Colleges graduates should not spend their 20s in their childhood bedrooms looking up at fading Obama posters, wondering when they can move out and get on with their lives. [cheers and applause]
The president was recently asked, do you have any regrets? Would you have done anything differently? He said, I need to talk more and — and tell the American people a story. So he needs to do more talking and we need to do better listening? Is that the idea here? (Jeers.) Friends, we have suffered from no shortage of words in the White House. What is missing is real leadership in the White House. [cheers and applause]
The question is this. If we stick with the same leadership that we had over the last four years, how do we expect anything to be different over the next four years? It won't be.
And that's why we are giving the country a clear choice. Real leadership — that's what the Romney-Ryan plan for a stronger middle class is all about. It's about getting people back to work, higher take-home pay, giving the kind of leadership this country deserves. I have so rarely seen in our history a moment where the man and the moment meet so well. This country needs leadership.
And you know what we saw last night? We saw a man introduce themselves to him — he brought us into his family. We saw a man of faith, of integrity, of achievement. (Scattered cheers.) Look at everything Mitt Romney's done with his life. It's success. It's hard work. It's achievement. It's leadership.
[cheers and applause]
This is a man, when his country asked him to help turn around the failing Olympics, dropped what he was doing, turned it around and made us all proud, and it saved the Olympics from disaster. [cheers and applause] This is a man who has proven he's a job creator. He created tens of thousands of jobs. He started businesses. He turned around struggling businesses. And by the way, being successful in business — that's a good thing in America. That's not — [chuckles] — a bad thing. [cheers and applause] That's what we do in America. That's the American dream.
The record of contrast could not be more stark. As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney worked across the aisle. He didn't demonize people on the other side of the aisle, and he balanced the budget without raising taxes. He lowered the unemployment rate. He increased household income. He improved the credit rating of Massachusetts.
What have we seen under President Obama's failed leadership? Higher unemployment, a downgrade of our credit for the first time in our history. Take-home pay is down by $4,000 over the last four years.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is very clear. This is our moment. This is the chance where we have a choice. Do we want the failed leadership, the stagnant economy, the debt crisis, the welfare state? Or do we want that opportunity society, that American idea where everybody can make the most of their lives and define happiness for themselves? [cheers and applause] That's the — that's the offer we're offering. That's the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to thank the people of Florida for their warm, warm hospitality — [cheers] — warm in many ways. [laughter]
You know, we have this rule in Wisconsin, if you turn 65, you've got to move to Florida for the winter. That's what my mom does. [laughter]
Now, it's really an honor right here to introduce you to the man who is meeting the moment, to the man who is going to be the leader of our country, to the man who is sharing himself for us; to the man who has proven in his life that he knows how to lead.
We're going to turn this around. We're going to get this done. We're going to get people back to work. We're going to turn the American idea back on. We're going to save this country and its promise for our next generation. And the reason we're going to do that is because we're going to elect the next president of the United States. His main — his name is Mitt Romney, and that's this man standing right here. [cheers and applause] And he's going to be the next president of the United States.
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you so much. [cheers and applause] What a welcome, what a send-off.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Wow, you guys are great. Thank you.
It's an honor to be here. You really have touched our — our hearts, Ann and my hearts and Paul and Janna. The welcome of the people in Florida is something we will not forget. This was a — a big week for us, and you made it a very special week for us.
People all over this state getting behind our effort and coming out and supporting us. And, of course, many are commenting on, well, one of the speeches I'll never forget, and that was by the lady in red back here. [cheers and applause] She — you know, I mentioned in my remarks last night that one of the things I wished I could do would be to wake up with a pile of kids on my floor in the — in the morning or go to bed at night with our kids coming in and talk to us about their problems, five little boys doing that. And I got back to my hotel room, and my daughter-in-law Jen said, we can arrange that, you know. [laughter]
With no further ado, the best mom, wife and grandmom I know, my sweetheart, Ann Romney. [cheers and applause]
ANN ROMNEY: Hi. There's so many of you, even over in the corners. Thank you for coming out, and thank you. And I want to say something that I said in my speech too. I hear your voices. [cheers and applause]
We have an awesome responsibility now. And I am so pleased to know that I have a guy standing next to me that has done amazing things in his life. He's turned around difficult situations. He's brought economic prosperity where — [inaudible] — thought it was impossible. I've seen him do it time and time again. And I said in my speech, and I'll say it again, give this man a chance, and he will not fail. [cheers and applause]
We need to give America a chance, and it's going to be an exciting ride. And boy, Florida is going to have to help us bring it home. So thank you all so much. [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: She's something else, I'll tell you.
And you got some great people here. I so much appreciate —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] [inaudible]
MR. ROMNEY: And — you know, some of the people I want to recognize today are your next senator.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] [inaudible]
MR. ROMNEY: There's a great guy over there, Representative, soon to be Senator, Connie Mack. Connie, thank you for being here. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] [inaudible]
MR. ROMNEY: I also want to thank your congressman, Dennis Ross. Thank you, Dennis, for being here. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: I want to thank my chairman of my campaign here in Florida. It's great to have Adam Putnam here, your agriculture commissioner — [cheers and applause] — and my other chairperson, your great attorney general, Pam Bondi.
I know they were out here speaking just a moment ago, and I appreciate their help and their support. It's meant the world to me. And Florida gave me the votes I needed to be become the nominee, and I thank Florida. [cheers and applause]
And now one more task: I need to have you do the work on November 6th that gets me elected the next president of the United States. That has to happen here in Florida. [cheers and applause] And for that to happen, you're going to have to go out and find a person or two who voted Barack — for Barack Obama. I know they're here, all right? They're — (scattered laughter) — they're not as visible as they used to be. You could see some of the — the glue on the back of their bumper sticker where it used — where it used to be. [laughter]
And — and so you can find them. But you find them and convince them to get in our team and to help us because we — we want to be held accountable for the promises we made last night. And the night before Paul Ryan and I spoke both spoke to the American people about what we'll do if we become president and vice president.
And I contrast that with what the president said four years ago when he was candidate Barack Obama. He got up and made a number of promises in Denver with the Greek columns behind him. He doesn't remind us of the Greek columns because he had said that he would cut the deficit in half. Measure him on that. How'd that work out? He doubled the deficit.
He said that he would be measured in a different way than — than other people are typically measured. He'd be measured by whether he created jobs or not. He hasn't. He said he'd be measured by whether people would have rising incomes or not. They don't. Incomes are down in this country. He said he'd be measured by whether people would take the risk to go out and start a business. We're at a 30-year low in new business startups. Almost every measure he described, he has failed to perform upon.
And the reason for that is not that he wasn't trying, in my view; it's he was pulling in the wrong direction. He didn't know what it takes to actually make the economy work.
Paul Ryan and I understand how the economy works. We understand how Washington works. We will reach across the aisle and find good people who like us, want to make sure this company (sic) deals with its challenges. We'll get America on track again. [cheers and applause]
And we've laid out — you've heard it many times — a five-point plan to get this country going. We're going to go after these things. Measure us. Hold us accountable. Do the same with the president. Look, you're making a choice as to who the servant will be of the nation. Who is the person, who are the people who will lead this country and do what you want to be done?
You listened to the last guy running for president. He laid out what he would do. He was unable to do it. It's time to give someone new a chance, hold us accountable. Listen to what we have to say, and say, do I want that or not?
Let me tell you what I want to do. I want to make sure that every person in this country that wants a job can find one. I want to make sure that every retiree knows that their retirement is secure, that Medicare is there and Social Security will be there. [cheers and applause] I want every parent to know that their child will get an education that will prepare them for the jobs of tomorrow.
These are things we're going to do by carrying out five critical steps. One, we're going to get America energy-independent by using our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear and our renewables. [cheers and applause]
Number two, we're going to open up trade, particularly next door in Latin America, but around the world open up new trade agreements. And we will crack down on any country like China that cheats on trade.
Number three, we're going to make sure our people who need work get the skills they need to succeed and the kids coming along get the education they need. And for that to happen, we have to put our kids first and say to the teachers, we're with you; we're going to help you, teachers, but the teachers' union, they're going behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four, we're going to get America on track to have a balanced budget by cutting the deficit.
And number five — [cheers] — number five, we're going to champion small business. Small business is where the great majority of jobs are created in this country. We're not going to raise taxes on small business like the president wants to. We're not going to expand regulation on business of all kinds like the president's done. And we're going to take off that big cloud of doubt that hangs over every small business I know. We're going to repeal and replace "Obamacare" with something that works — [cheers and applause] — to hold down the cost of health care.
So last night you got to know me a little better with some friends that talked about my life, the things that have been part of my life in the past. I talked to you a bit about my family. And I was embarrassed from time to time with the nice things that were said. Some people were overly generous. But I appreciated it.
We got to know Paul and Janna a little bit. You're going to come to know them better and better. This is a man of real character, a man who has done something unusual in Washington, which is, he's focused on helping America, not focused on trying to get himself re-elected. And because of that, he's won by larger and larger margins. This guy, in a Democrat district, wins and wins — a great leader. He'll be a terrific vice president. [cheers and applause]
Now I recognize in this crowd that there are some people who have served our country in a way that most of us can only imagine, and they're individuals who have served in our — in our armed forces. And I — I recognize a man here from the American Legion. I see a man over there from the United States Navy. Will all of those who serve in armed forces or are veterans, please raise your hand and be recognized.
[cheers and applause] Thank you, sir. Thank you. Wow.
It's one of the things I love about this great state of Florida, which is our veterans who come here, our men and women in uniform who have served from here and that come from this great state.
We — we've got another special request to ask of you, and you know that. You gave me the nomination with your votes. You've come out today to support us. The convention was a — a magnificent and wonderful opportunity for us to share our message with the American people, thanks in large measure to the folks here in — in Florida. And now we really do need you to get out there and get your friends to vote. We're not going to say vote early and vote often, as they do in some states. [laughter] We're instead going to tell you to get your friends to vote, to pull people to the polls that might not be planning to get to the polls. We need every single vote in Florida.
You've proved it before, Florida can be a very, very close election. I — I don't know how it's going to work out, but I'm planning on winning in Florida. We're going to get this country back and keep it the hope of the earth — [cheers and applause] — with your help.
Thank you, guys. We love this country and we're taking it back. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Remarks with Paul Ryan and Ann Romney at a Campaign Event in Jacksonville, Florida

September 1, 2012

RYAN: Thank you. Thank you, Jacksonville! Hey, wow! Thank you so much for your hospitality. It is great and you know what, Florida is going to elect Mitt Romney the next president of the United States, aren't you? That's right. [applause] We have our better halves here on stage with us, my wife Janna and you all know Ann Romney because she gave what a speech in Tampa. Wow. [applause]
And we're here with our Florida family resident. My mom Betty's up over there. She's a resident here in Florida. We used to come down in spring break. It's a little cooler then. But you know what, we've got a big choice to make as a country. And our country has seen bright days before. Our country — and they say this is kind of insulting or something in Washington. But I'm going to say it. We are an exceptional nation because of what we have done for ourselves, because of our principles. [applause]
I look around here and I see veterans, I see Air Force, I see marines, I see Army over there. I see a lot of Navy. [applause] Thank you for your service to our country. You make us proud. But we have a big choice to make and the hospitality we got on the other side of the state in Tampa, thank you, Florida, thank you, Tampa, for giving us this great sendoff because we're giving the country the plan to get America back on the right track. [applause]
You know, President Obama inherited a difficult situation when he came into office, as he has reminded us a time or two. Here's the problem. He made things worse. We're not better off. We're worse off. So here's the question. Without a change in leadership, how are the next four years going to be any different than the last four years? We need leadership. We need to fix this country's problems before they get out of our control. We want that opportunity. Society with a safety net, a society of upward mobility where everybody can make the most of their lives. That's the American dream. [applause]
What is so special and so precious about this time, about this moment is that this man and this moment are made for our history. I have never seen a man and a moment come so together so well like Mitt Romney is providing the kind of leadership we need. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
REP. RYAN: Look at his life. Look at his values. Look at his achievements. Remember the Olympics back in the late '90s in Salt Lake? Remember the wasteful spending, the corruption, the abuse? Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it? What did they do? They looked around America and they said we need a leader to come fix this mess and fix the Olympics. They called Mitt Romney. He dropped everything. He came to Salt Lake, lived there for three years and turned the Olympics around and he made us all proud. [applause]
And this is a man who knows firsthand how to create jobs. This is a man who started successful businesses, who turned around failing businesses. This is a man who knows firsthand how to create jobs because he created tens of thousands of jobs. I tell you what. I am proud to stand next to a man who knows that if you have a small business, you built that small business. That's your achievement. The government doesn't get credit. You do. And by the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing in this country. [applause]
We don't resent that. We take pride in that. Look at the contrast between these two individuals. President Obama came in with all this rhetoric and all these lofty promises. They've all been broken. He promised to cut the deficit in half. No. He said he'd prevent unemployment from getting above 8 percent. It's been above 8 percent for 42 months.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
REP. RYAN: Because of his fundamental lack of leadership, the credit rating of our country was downgraded for the first time in our history.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
REP. RYAN: Look at what Mitt Romney did and accomplished as governor of Massachusetts. He lowered unemployment. He increased family income $5,000. He improved the credit rating of his state. He got people back to work. And more importantly, remember the president when he used to say we're not red states, we're not blue states, we're the United States of America. [applause]
Remember he used to say put aside childish things. This is the third president I have served with and I have never seen this kind of partisan acrimony. I've never seen this much dysfunction and gridlock. What did Mitt Romney do as governor of Massachusetts, a state where nearly 9 out of 10 of the legislators were in the other party? He didn't demonize them. He didn't make fun of them. He actually worked with them and he balanced the budget without raising taxes. [applause]
This is more than just about jobs. This is more than just about turning around our economy. This is the most important election in our lifetimes no matter what generation you come from. It's really a question about who we are, what kind of country we want to have, what kind of people do we want to be, what kind of legacy we want to leave to our children and our grandchildren. This moment requires leadership. This moment requires people of principle. This moment requires action, not blame. Mitt Romney is the man for this moment. [applause]
Here is our pledge. We will not duck the tough issues and we will not kick the can down the road. We will lead. We believe in prosperity. We believe in the opportunity society. We believe in a strong national defense. We will not set aside these responsibilities of America. And we will not spend the next four years blaming other people. We will take responsibility and fix this country's problems. [applause]
And we will not try to replace our country's founding principles we will not try to transform this country into something it was never intended to be. We will reapply our founding principles. That's who we are. That's what we do. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, it is in our hands. It is in your hands. Florida, Floridians, you have a major say-so. You have a big responsibility and a big opportunity.
If Florida goes the right way, America goes the right way. [applause] You know what, we're going to do this. We're going to get this done. We're going to fix our problems and we're going to do this because we're going to elect the man who's standing next to me as the next president of the United States. His name is Mitt Romney. And he's going to be the next president of the United States. [applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Romney, Ryan! Romney, Ryan! Romney, Ryan!
AUDIENCE: Romney, Ryan!
MR. ROMNEY: That's quite a welcome. Thank you! Thank you! I brought with me the brains of my family and the beauty. I saw her in high school.
She was 15-years-old when I really took notice of Ann Davies, now Ann Davies Romney. I told the guy she came to the dance with that I'd like to give her a ride home because I lived closed to her home than he was. She agreed — or he agreed to let me do him that favor and that's been a favor I won't soon forget. My sweetheart, Ann Romney. Come on up here and say hi. [applause]
ANN ROMNEY: Wow, Jacksonville! Thank you, Jacksonville! [applause] I think that this town can do something. You can let everyone in the whole country hear your voice today. You can let everybody know that guess what's going to happen in the state of Florida, in the town of Jacksonville. We are going to elect the next president of the United States. [applause] Well, it's a hot day. You guys are great. I know you didn't just come out just because you think these two guys are great. You came out — maybe you do. But you came out because you love America. [applause]
My grandfather came from the coal mines of Wales without a penny in his pocket to this country. My father was 15 when he immigrated. And they came for hope, for opportunity, for a better life. And now, it's our responsibility to make sure that our children have that same promise. We are going to make sure that this guy works every day and that we hear your voices, we know why you're here and we're going to take America back. Thank you so much. [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: She is the best! Now, it's great to be here in Jacksonville with my friends in Florida. You're going to help us win this thing. [applause] I've noticed it's slightly warm today, just slightly. I appreciate your being out here in the warmth like this. And I have something to ask you to do and I'm going to convince you to do it by the time I'm finished I believe
I need to ask each one of you to find one person who voted for Barack Obama last time. And they're out there. I know that you can usually tell where they are because on their cars you see the glue from where the bumper sticker used to be, all right. And so you can find them and you need to go to those guys and each one of you needs to find one person who voted for Barack Obama and convince them to vote for Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney. [applause]
And to do that, you can go back because this is going to be the Democrats' convention. You can go back and say, look, do you remember President Obama's speech and his promises from when he was running four years ago. And they'll nod their head. You say, let me remind you of something. He said that he was going to measure success by whether he was going to get incomes to go up. But they've gone down $4,000 a family. He was going —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, he was going to measure success by whether entrepreneurs would be more willing to start businesses. We're at a 30-year low in startups of new businesses. And that's where jobs are created. He said you'd measure success by whether people are able to find good jobs. We have 23 million Americans out of work or dropped out of the workforce or can't find full-time work. Look, if there's a coach whose record is 0 and 23 million, you get rid of him and get someone new. [applause]
I don't like the way this game is going under this president. This is time for us to get a new leader who understands what it takes to get America working again. I do. I want to use that experience to help make sure that I make promises you look at and say hold him accountable, make sure he does what he says he'll do. And let me tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to do five things, five things that are going to get this economy roaring back to life.
I'm not just kidding about this. This is going to make a dramatic difference. Number one, we're going to take advantage of our energy resources — our oil, our coal, our gas, nuclear, renewables. We'll have North America energy independence within eight years. That makes a big difference. [applause] Number two — number two, I'm going to fix our schools and make sure the training programs for adults work to give us the skills we need. We're going to make sure our kids and their teachers come first and the teachers union comes behind. [applause]
We're going to have trade that works for America. We're going to open up Latin American markets and other markets around the world. We're going to crack down on cheaters like China where they steal American jobs unfairly. [applause] Number four, we're going to do something you have to do if you're going to have entrepreneurs risk their life savings to start a business.
And that's to convince them that we're not going to end up becoming like Greece. For that to be the case, we're going to have to show them that we can live within our means. We'll stop spending more than we take in. So we're going to cut federal spending and finally get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause] Now, there's only one place — there's only one place this president's wiling to cut and not just a little — he wants to cut a trillion dollars out of our military budget —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: Look, that's bad for jobs and it's bad for our national security. The world is not a safer place right now, not with Iran trying to cut nuclear — dangers throughout the world. If I'm president and Paul Ryan's vice president, we will not cut our military budget. [applause] Number five — number five, we're going to champion small business. You see, small business is where jobs are created in this country. We're going to make it easier for entrepreneurs and innovators and small businesses of all kinds.
The president wants to raise taxes on small business from 35 percent to 40 percent. That would kill jobs. We want to bring them down. We also want to get regulation and regulators to encourage small business not to crush it. And we've got to take that big cloud off of small business that's keeping them from hiring people right now. We've got to repeal and replace "Obamacare". [applause]
We do those five things — we do those five things and you're going to see this economy come roaring back. We're going to create 12 million jobs over these next four years. You're going to see more jobs and more take-home pay not just because you want it but because you deserve it. These have been tough years. [applause] This has been a hard time for American families. You know that. Middle income families — I saw a report just this morning that with middle income families that not only have jobs been lost but it was middle income jobs that were lost. And the jobs that are coming back are — the majority are low wage jobs. So even though we're getting a few jobs back, which is welcome and all jobs are welcome, the fact that they are low wage jobs makes this an even tougher time for middle income families.
With a middle income family income on average — or median income down $4,000 a family, I mean, you think about that at the same time health insurance premiums are up and food prices are up and gasoline prices are up and electric utility bills are up. These are tough times for American families. The president's answer to a tough like this — time like this has been — yeah, he said play golf. That's true. But his political answer is to say, look, let's divide America. Let's have Americans attack one another. Let's be divisive and dismissive and derisive and that's not the right course.
That's not who we are. The story of America has been a history of the many becoming one to accomplish extraordinary things, the people coming together in America built the strongest economy in the history of the Earth. The people — yeah, we built it, we built it, yeah. And the people in America coming together put a man on the mood 43 years ago. I was just this morning in Cincinnati at the home of Neil Armstrong, an American hero with passion and courage and patriotism.
That's what America is. America coming united together we were able to stop an unspeakable, unthinkable darkness from spreading across the Earth during the Second World War. I appreciate our Second World War veterans more than you can imagine. [applause] And I can promise you this. Paul Ryan and I are going to unite America. We're going to call on the greatness of the American spirit to come together. We're going to encourage individuals to know that they can build it here in America, that there's a bright and prosperous future here. You deserve that.
You deserve that after these four years of trouble that you've had. We're tired of being tired in America. We're tired of being told that someone else is responsible for our difficulties. Look, it's time for us to take responsibility for the course of America to get us back on track. You can change the course of this country. We're going to take America back. The future demands it. The future is out there for us to take it. Our kids deserve it. You deserve it. The nation deserves it. Peace on the planet depends on it. Thank you so much! We're going to take back America. Thank you! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks with Ann Romney at a Campaign Event in Cincinnati, Ohio

September 1, 2012

What a welcome! Thank you! Thank you so very much. What a welcome, Cincinnati! Thank you so very much! [applause] You know, I was asked why it was we made Cincinnati our first stop after becoming the nominee, our first political stop. I think you gave them the answer this morning. Thank you! [applause] I brought with me a very special person who lit up the convention and who's going to lit up — light up America, my sweetheart, Ann Romney. [applause]
ANN ROMNEY: Wow! That is an unbelievable reception. We are so grateful for all of you coming out. And I know why you're doing it. It's not just for us. You're doing it for the country. [applause] You all have figured it out and you know this is an important election. We've been across this country and we have seen so many families and individuals that are hurting, that are looking for hope and looking for help. Well, let's guess what. Help is on the way. [applause] I had a chance to talk a little bit about this guy that I love at the convention and I wanted to talk from my heart. I hope that you all felt that it was so much from my heart. [applause] I believe in America and I believe in this man. And I know he can get it right for us. So thank you all very much. [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Now, getting ready — getting ready for my convention speech, I read some speeches from some other people who'd spoken at conventions. I actually also read the inaugural speeches of some of our great presidents and heroes in my life. And one of the speeches I read was the convention speech of Barack Obama. He was not one of the ones that I wanted to draw from except I could not resist a couple of the things he said because he made a lot of promises. And I noted that he didn't keep a lot of promises.
One of the promises he made was he was going to create more jobs. And today, 23 million people are out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. Let me tell you, if you have a coach that's 0 and 23 million, you say it's time to get a new coach. [applause] It's time for America to see a winning season again and we're going to bring it to them. [applause]
Now, he famously said that he was going to slow the rise of the oceans and he was going to heal the planet. And our promise to you is this: we are going to help the American people and help the families of America. [applause] This is a great state. You've got a great governor, by the way, John Kasich. He's doing a terrific job. [applause] And he's showing the president if the president would only look how it is that you can bring more jobs back to a state. What he's done is made Ohio more business-friendly. He's held down taxes. He's balanced budgets. We have a plan. Paul Ryan and I have a plan that's going to get America working again. [applause]
It's going to create about 12 million new jobs in America and about 460,000 jobs right here in Ohio. [applause] Five things we'll do — five things that will get this economy growing again. And by the way, I need Josh Mandel in the Senate to make that happen. [applause] And of course Rob Portman will be there and Speaker Boehner and all his good Republicans, we need to have them as well. [applause]
Those five things: number one, get North America energy independence, use our oil, our coal, our gas, nuclear and renewables. [applause] Number two — number two, make trade work for us. We'll open up new markets where we can sell goods and services and we'll crack down on China and any other cheaters. [applause] Number, three, we're going to make sure our workers have the skills they need to succeed and that our kids have the skills they need to succeed in the coming century because right now our schools in far too many places in America aren't doing the job they need to do. And I want to make sure we put our kids and the teachers first and the teachers union behind. [applause]
Number four — number four: you're not going to get entrepreneurs and businesses of all kinds to invest in Ohio and invest in our other states in America, put their life savings to work here unless they know we're not headed to the place Greece is in or Spain or Italy or those places that have had such trauma overseas. And so, to make sure that's the case, we're going to finally have to do something that Republicans have spoken about for a long time and for a while we didn't do it. When we had the lead, we let people down. We need to make sure we don't let them down this time. I will cut the deficit and get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause]
And number five, I want to champion small business. I want to make it easier for entrepreneurs and innovators to grow and build businesses because that's where most of our jobs come from. [applause] And so instead of doing what the president says he wants to do which is raising taxes on our best small businesses, I want to bring them down. And I want regulators to understand their job is to help encourage small business. And I want to take that big cloud off of small businesses that's keeping them from hiring people. I want to get rid of "Obamacare" and replace it with something that'll hold down the cost of health care. [applause] We don't —
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: We recognize what a great responsibility you've given us, how much you expect from us to be able to get back the White House and get America back on track. We've seen these last four years a lot of disappointment, a lot of families having hard times. I saw a report just this morning that even as some jobs are being created, as they look at the jobs being created they note that the jobs we lost were middle income jobs and the jobs we're getting back are low wage jobs.
People in this country are having hard times. The average income in America — the median income in America, rather — has dropped by $4,000 a family even as the price of gasoline is up and food is up and health premiums are up. These are tough times for the American people. And added to all that is the divisiveness and bitterness that we've seen from the president's campaign. Look, America is a story of the many becoming one and accomplishing extraordinary thing because of our unity. I thought today of the great heroism, patriotism, courage of one of Ohio's best — Neil Armstrong. What a champion. [applause]
The courage and character of that one man combined with the unity of so many who came together to help achieve a great accomplishment, it's a model for our nation. I will do everything in my power to bring us together because united America — America built the strongest economy in the history of the Earth. United we put Neil Armstrong on the moon. United we faced down unspeakable darkness. United our men and women and uniform continue to defend freedom today. I love those people who serve our great nation. [applause]
This is a time — this is a time for us to come together as a nation. We do not have to have the kind of divisiveness and bitterness and recriminations we've seen over the last four years. I will bring us together. I'll put in place those five steps I described. America is going to come roaring back. A better future is head. It's out there waiting for us. Our families deserve it. Our children demand it. The peace of the planet depends upon it. I love America. We're taking this country back. We're going to get America strong again for you, for your children, for the future. God bless the United States of America and God bless the great people of Ohio. Thank you so very much. Thank you. [applause]

Remarks in Concord, New Hampshire

September 6, 2012

I actually think it will be interesting to listen to the president tonight. What I'd like him to do is report on his promises. But there are forgotten promises and forgotten people.
Over the last four years, the president has said that he was going to create jobs for the American people and that hasn't happened. He said he'd cut the deficit in half and that hasn't happened. He said that incomes would rise and instead incomes have gone down. And I — I think this is a time not for him not to start restating new promises, but to report on the promises he made. I think he wants a promises reset. We want a report on the promises he made.
And that means let's hear some numbers. Let's hear 16 — $16 trillion of debt. This is very different than the promise he made. Let's hear the number 47 — 47 million people in this country on food stamps. When he took office, 33 million people were on food stamps. Let's understand why it was he's been unsuccessful in helping alleviate poverty in this country, why so many people have fallen from the middle class into poverty under this president. Let's have him explain to the American people the 50 percent number: why 50 percent of college graduates can't find work or work that's consistent with their college degree. The president needs to report tonight on his promises rather than try and reset a whole series of new promises that he also won't be able to keep.

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Orange City, Iowa

September 7, 2012

Thank you so very much. What a welcome! Iowa knows how to do it right, I'll tell you that. That's quite a welcome. I — [cheers and applause] — thank you, Orange City, Mr. Mayor. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Northwestern College. What a welcome.
Mr. President, thank you for letting me be on your campus today and bringing a few of your students here with you. How many here are going to Northwestern College? Yeah. [cheers and applause]
And thank you to Governor Terry Branstad. Isn't this terrific that a guy who had been governor before and moved on to the private sector, was enjoying his career teaching and — and guiding a — a great institution of higher learning. He says, you know, Iowa needs the real kind of leadership that only he could bring. He came back and ran for — for office, is a great governor, has put Iowa — as he just described — on the top charts in terms of the best places to do business, with jobs being created.
Thank you, Governor Terry Branstad. [cheers and applause]
And thank you to Orange City for doing such a great job on electing people who believe in conservative principles, who love the Constitution and will stand for the principles that America was based upon. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Now, I have to tell you, I know there's a lot of bad news out there. But I'm looking beyond the bad news. I'm looking over the hill and seeing what's going to happen just down the road a bit. And what's going to happen is America's about to come roaring back. I'm absolutely convinced — [cheers and applause] — look, this is the greatest nation in the history of the earth. The principles upon which this country was founded, those principles are — are — are continuing to guide and inspire the people of America and people around the world. And if we restore those principles, you're going to see our economy come roaring back. And with a strong economy, we can maintain the strongest military in the world.
The world depends on a strong America. I was in Poland some weeks ago and met with Lech Walesa. I came in the — his meeting area there, and he said, Mr. Romney, you must be tired from coming across the — the ocean. He said, why don't you sit down, and I'll talk. And I sat down, and — and he began to speak. And he — what he said for about 15 minutes was — boiled down to this. He said, where is America's leadership? We need America's leadership. America must lead. There's no question about the principles of freedom and personal responsibility and dignity that have always formed the basis of America. Those principles need to be spoken loud and clear and demonstrated on the world stage, and I will do it again. [cheers and applause]
Now, yesterday — yesterday you had the chance, if you wanted to, to watch the president of the United States address the people of America in his acceptance speech. And I read that this morning — you haven't perhaps got a chance to do that. But if you did, perhaps, like me, you found it extraordinarily disappointing, surprisingly disappointing, because his speech four years ago, he laid out a whole series of lofty goals. And unfortunately, he was unable to meet them. As a matter of fact, I can think of very few of the promises he made four years ago that he's kept.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Exactly!
MR. ROMNEY: He — he said he'd raise incomes for people. In fact, they've gone down by $5,000 a family. He said he'd create more new businesses. People who wanted to start a business would be encouraged to do so. But in fact, we're at a 30-year low in new business startups. He was going to get the people back to work. His — you remember with his — his stimulus plan? The stimulus said that if we let him borrow $787 billion, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent. It's been 43 straight months above 8 percent. There are today 23 million Americans that are out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. It's a national tragedy. He also said he'd cut the deficit in half. He doubled it.
One promise he kept, though. He said if his energy policies got put in place, the cost of energy would skyrocket, and that's happened. [laughter] This is time for a new president — [cheers and applause] — with a different vision for America.
Now, I was — [cheers and applause] — I was surprised by his address because I — I expected him to confront the major challenge of the last four years, which is an economy which has not produced the jobs that the American people need. I expected him to talk about 23 million people or at least to talk about the unemployed in America. I expected him to talk about the number of families having a hard time making ends meet, the number of middle-income families who've seen the cost of health insurance go up, the cost of food go up, the cost of gasoline go up, even as their incomes have gone down.
I expected him to talk about those things, but he did not. Instead, it was a whole series of new promises which he also won't be able to keep because the policies he believes in and the direction he's pulling will not make America stronger. If President Obama were re-elected, we would have four more years of the last four years, and the American people are going to say to — no to that. [cheers and applause]
Now, there's something else that you've watched in the president's campaign over the past several months, and that is an increasingly divisive and dismissive approach to the American people. It's been a campaign of pitting one American against another, and it's so contrary to our national history and our national spirit. The story of America has been one of the many becoming one. The story of America is a united people coming to build the strongest economy in the history of the world. The story has — a united people that has confronted unspeakable darkness and stopped it from spreading across the earth in the Second World War — and fighting it again, time and again, when — when evil rears its head around the world. As Lech Walesa indicated, America's leadership has been needed and is needed today.
That's been the story of America: People coming together. And one thing I can assure you, if — is that if I'm president of the United States, I will stop this divisiveness and I will do everything in my power to unite the American people.
[cheers and applause]
Now, you might have — you might have expected the president of the United States to lay out a plan for what he'd do to get the economy going again and get people working again. And he didn't do that last night. Again that was surprising to me. I laid out the things I'm going to do to get this economy going. And let me tell you what they are, one by one, five things. You've heard me talk about them before. I want to talk about them some more because I want you to know I'm not just talking about 12 million new jobs. I know how to get the private sector to create 12 million new jobs. I know what it's going to take to do that. [cheers and applause]
Let me tell you what they are. Number one, I'm going to take full advantage of our energy resources, our coal, our oil, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. [cheers and applause] And — and by doing that, we become energy independent, North America does, by 2020. Now, you might think, well, how do you get there? Let me tell you some of the things you do.
One, you take full advantage of what's known as tight oil. That's oil that's in tight formations, and they pump in fluid to push it out, get more oil out. It also means taking advantage of that pipeline from Canada, getting that oil coming out from Canada, the Keystone pipeline. [cheers and applause]
It means turning the Gulf of Mexico back on so we get oil out of the Gulf. And by the way, over the last four years the president has cut the number of permits and licenses on federal land and in federal waters in half. I will double the number of licenses and permits so we get more oil and energy. [cheers and applause]
And natural gas is our big ace in the hole.
We got a lot of natural gas. That natural gas being brought to our transportation hubs, that natural gas being brought to places where — where now they don't have it, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is going to bring jobs back to America.
So number one for me is taking advantage of our energy resources, and that will put millions of Americans back to work.
Number two — [cheers and applause] — and I'm looking here at Steve King. This man needs to be your congressman again. I want him as my partner in Washington, D.C. [cheers and applause]
Number two, I want to make sure that our workers have the skills for this jobs of today and that you young people have the skills you need for the jobs of tomorrow. And that latter request and that latter demand suggest that we finally have to make sure that our schools are run for the benefit of the students, that we put the students and their parents and the teachers first, and the teachers' union, they're going to have to go behind. We've got to have our — [cheers and applause] — our kids run for our — our schools run for our kids.
Let me mention a third, and that's — and that's trade. The third thing I'm going to do is really take advantage of trade opportunities. You see, America is the most productive nation on the planet of the major economic powers. That means we make more stuff per person than any other nation. And because we make more stuff per person, we're the most productive. And therefore it's good for us to trade with other nations. As we do, we'll create more jobs. You know that here in Iowa. You ship products, whether agricultural or manufactured, or services, around the world. It creates jobs here in Iowa to trade.
And this president is the first since Roosevelt, FDR, not to — to seek and receive trade promotion authority to be able to work out new trade deals with other nations.
I'm going to fight for the capacity to create new trade opportunities. And because I spent my life in the private sector, 25 years, I understand what kind of deals are good for America and which aren't.
So I'm going to make trade work for America. And by the way, if nations we trade with decide to take advantage of us unfairly, and cheat, there'll be consequences. I will finally do what needs to be done to make sure China doesn't cheat and take our jobs. [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four — and this is one that is not just economic, it's also moral, as the governor said. And that is it is simply wrong for us — morally wrong for us — to continue to spend massively more than we take in year-in and year-out knowing that my generation will never pay that back, it's all going to be passed on to your generation. We are killing the American dream for our children. It's wrong. It will stop if I'm president of the United States. [cheers and applause]
I've got one more. I've got one more, and that's this. I'm going to champion small business. You see, I happen to understand how it is that small businesses get going and how it is they grow. I — I — as I was driving in to Orange City, I saw a Staples distribution facility there, a big sign said Staples. I hope you saw that. [cheers and applause]
As — as you know, I — I was one of those that helped finance the very first Staples store. I remember going to the store the night before it opened and talking to the various folks that were putting various products on the shelf. We wondered what would happen.
Would people come to our store or not? And I remember talking to one of the founders, and I said, what do we do if no one comes? He said, that's easy — lower prices and advertise more. And I said, well, what happens if they still don't come? He said, that's easy — lower prices some more and advertise some more.
And so that little one store, in a place called Brighton, Massachusetts, has now grown to be hundreds, thousands of stores worldwide, with distribution centers here and all over the country. It's a remarkable story. It's the story of America, how individuals pursuing their dreams in fact built it themselves and — [cheers and applause] — and by virtue of their dreams and a great nation that welcomes dreamers and the support of all the people that work at an enterprise like Staples, they were able to create a business which employs about 90,000 Americans today.
So I know that to get Americans back to work and to create the 12 million jobs I'm dedicated to creating, I have to create the conditions and the environment that encourages entrepreneurs and innovators and small businesspeople to start businesses and to grow them. And for that to happen, there are a couple of things I've got to do.
One, I want them to know that if they're successful, if they're one of the very few of the startups that actually makes it, that they'll be able to keep a good deal of their own profits, their own earnings, and be able to plow it into the business to grow, because if you raise taxes on small business, a lot of them won't even start and those that do won't be able to grow. So for me, holding down taxes on small business is essential.
And number two, I want regulators to know their job, yes, is to catch the bad guys — there will always be bad guys out there; you got to catch them. But you also have to recognize that your job is to encourage the good guys. Regulators and regulations have to encourage small business — [cheers and applause] — make it easier to grow, get behind our enterprises.
And then if you really want to help small business, if you really want to help small business, you have to take that cloud off of them, that cloud that's keeping so many small businesses from adding employment. The Chamber of Commerce carried out a survey. They asked businesses all over America, what's the impact of a particular piece of legislation, and the people came back — 75 percent of the people surveyed said that piece of legislation keeps us from hiring people. That legislation we have to get rid of is known as "Obamacare," and I'm going to get rid of it. [cheers and applause]
Now that doesn't mean — that doesn't mean we're not going to make improvements to our health care system. We — we know that health care's too expensive. "Obamacare" doesn't make it less expensive. When the president ran for office, he said he'd cut premiums by $2,500 per family. "Obamacare" passes. Now, by the way, they're up $2,500 a family. That's a $5,000 difference. And median family income in America of $50,000, about, that $5,000 is a huge impact —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right.
MR. ROMNEY: — has a huge impact. I'm going to go after getting the costs of health care to get reined in, mostly going to make — and by the way, I'm going to do that by taking on malpractice. I'm going to do that by letting individuals be able to buy their own insurance — [applause] — without just getting it from their company.
And — and of course in health care we have to make sure that people who have pre-existing conditions are able to get insured and that — and that folks that — that get sick don't get dropped by their insurance company.
There are a lot of things that we can do to improve, but we don't have to have "Obamacare" that raises taxes, we don't have to have "Obamacare" that cuts Medicare by $716 billion. We're going to get rid of "Obamacare," restore funding to Medicare and keep the promises we've made to our seniors. [cheers and applause]
I have to tell you, I'm excited about what I see ahead. I'm absolutely convinced the American people are going to take a good, careful look at both people running for president and they're going to ask themselves, what do I want going forward? Do I want a president that's continue — going to continue the policies that he put in place over the last four years that led to record levels of unemployment — [booing] — what, now 43 straight months above 8 percent — did you see the jobs report this morning, by the way?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: Ninety — ninety-five thousand, I believe, net new jobs created and almost 400,000 people dropped out of the workforce altogether. [boos] It's — it's simply unimaginable. The president said that by this time we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment. Instead, we're at about 8 percent. And you know the difference that that makes, and how many people would be working in America? Nine million people. Had he been able to keep his promise, had his — had his policies worked as he thought they would, there would be 9 million more Americans working.
If that had been the case, we'd have a lot better budget setting — we'd have a lot better family life in this country, where people are struggling to make ends meet. We wouldn't have many kids wondering, whether when they get home at night mom and dad will be there, because with two jobs, trying to make ends meet, they can't be there. We wouldn't have as many seniors wondering whether they're going to be able to put food on the table at the end of the week. We wouldn't have as many young people wondering whether they can afford college next semester. Wouldn't have as many college graduates asking themself, can I possibly find a job when half today of our college graduates can't find work or work consistent with a college degree.
Look, this is important. Nine million people. This president tried, but he didn't understand what it takes to make our economy work. I do. I will use that experience to get Americans to work again. [cheers and applause]
At the Democratic convention, they had that video that said that we all belong to the government. [boos] Boy, they sure got that one wrong, didn't they? The government belongs to us, and we — [cheers and applause] — and we value the government we have. And we pay for it, too. It ain't free. And — and we want that government to encourage and protect our freedoms, to honor its promises, to create the conditions that make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs and innovators and students coming out of school to be able to begin their life. That's what I'm dedicated to doing.
I love this country. I love the principles upon which it was founded. I don't want to transform America into Europe. I don't want a bigger and bigger government, more and more intrusive, telling us how to live our lives. I instead want a government which encourages individual initiative and freedom. I will be a president who will never say to you you didn't build it. If you get the honor roll, I'll congratulate you, not the bus driver that got you to school. [cheers and applause] I believe in individual achievement.
Now, one more thing I just want to — want to say to — to you that are going to college here. You've got friends that are going to college here and around — around Iowa and around the country, and you're going to have a big say. You may even have the deciding say as to who the next president is. And I know that the president and his party are going to everything in their power to convince you to vote — to vote for them.
But I want you to ask this question: Who is dedicated to making sure we don't pass on trillion dollars of debt to you? I am. My party is. We're absolutely committed to making sure you're able to live the American dream.
The other party will promise you lots of free stuff. But then ask them how are they paying for it and they say, oh, we're borrowing money from China to do that. [cheers and applause] And guess who's going to pay the interest on that? Guess who's going to pay the interest? Guess who's going to pay it back all their lives? You are.
Look, I want — I want the young — I see a sign up there — 16 trillion (dollars) in debt — thanks for making that; thanks for reminding us. By the way, the — Governor Branstad and I, we won't be paying that back, you see. We'll both be gone when that's paid back. You guys will be paying for that. You're going to pay the interest on it. You're going to pay the interest, and it's going to get larger and larger till that interest swamps even more than our total defense budget. That's what's going to happen unless we get serious about reining in the excesses of government.
The president's answer — we all respect our government, but we don't want it to get so big that is crushes the dreams of the American people, and I will fight for the young people of America by getting us finally on track to a balanced budget. (Extended cheers, applause.)
You guys, we're going to win this thing. This day we're stepping forward, we're taking back America, we're going to make sure that America remains the hope of the earth. We're going to keep America the shining city on a hill Ronald Reagan spoke of. I love this country. I love the people of America. I believe in the people of America, and we're going to take back America and keep it strong.
Thank you so very much! [cheers and applause] Thank you!

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Nashua, New Hampshire

September 7, 2012

ANN ROMNEY: [in progress] — And it was with great pride that I also had my son Craig speak at the convention and what a joy life has been with those five boys, those five boys that were so raucous. If I could have seen into the future and known how good it was going to be when I was struggling with those boys — [laughter]. And what a joy it was as well to have my daughters-in-law there and my 18 grandchildren. [applause]
[inaudible] — she turns 17 tomorrow. So I'm now the grandmother of a teenager. And it is — it's been a great journey. We've been traveling all across this nation and we have come home here, haven't we? [applause] What I'm hearing and what Mitt is hearing are voices of those 23 million and all of the Americans that are out there that are telling us and begging us please help us, please — will you please save America for us. And we are here to tell you that help is on the way. [applause]
I was also grateful at the convention for other people to stand up and say we're tired of Mitt being maligned and lied to about how his behavior, even has character has been maligned.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MS. ROMNEY: And I loved it that people in our lives stood up and said, let me tell you another story, and that story is he's the man that was at the 14-year-old bedside when he was dying of leukemia. He was the man that was at the bedside of a mother who had a premature baby three months before it was due. That's where Mitt is. If you want to know where trouble is, find Mitt in trouble — along with trouble, helping out.
And that's the kind of character this man has and I love that people in America have been able to see through a different lens now in seeing what I see which is the goodness of this man. Now, on top of that, guess what. He's got experience too. [applause] This is a guy that knows how to fix things. And I can't wait to turn the engine and the keys to the car so that he can turn that engine back on and get this economy growing and get people back to work and get America working again. [applause]
So you've got my children out there now. I'm going to be out there a lot. We're all going to have to be out there. We're going to have to convince everyone that's now undecided that the guy that's been in office before, he said it best himself: if I can't turn this economy around, I'm going to be a one-term president. [applause]
[inaudible] — and we have this great joy together in January and have a wonderful party in Washington, D.C., and celebrate the next president of the United States. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY (R), THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT: [inaudible] — she's a little biased — a remarkable woman, a remarkable mother who raised those five sons beautifully. They respect her and admire her and I respect her and admire her. You know, as we began our marriage, I probably followed the old Woody Allen rule that 95 percent of history can be explained as a man trying to impress a woman. [laughter]
And I tried to impress her. And then as time went on, I realized that impressing her was not my object. Instead, I should listen to her because her perspectives and her ideas and her lines and how she evaluated things was oftentimes better than mine. And she had the capacity to help me in every responsibility I've had, not just in raising the kids that she helped me and she did that job primarily herself but also in my business life and at the Olympics and when I was governor and in my campaigns. Ann has always been a source of guidance and strength and stability. I love that woman and I appreciate you giving her such a — [inaudible] [applause].
Now, I'm now quite — I'm not quite sure what's going on behind me. Every now and then these things — [inaudible] [applause]. I'm sure it's great. I'm sure it's great. [laughter] You know, I'm excited. I have to tell you we just went through two conventions and people saw a pretty stark contrast between the two conventions as we talked about our vision for America. And my vision for America is to restore the principles that made our economy the strongest in the world, to restore the sense of unity that's always existed in America, of drawing people together and saying as a united people we'll overcome any challenge we have. My sense of those conventions is that I laid out a plan that's going to get America working again and make sure we can — [inaudible] [applause]
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Now, I know that today a number of you would come away with heavy hearts because we've given people a lot of bad news lately. We've seen over the last three-and-a-half years a lot of bad news. Americans are tired of being tired. These have been tough times. And just today another report came out on the jobs front, another disappointing, sad report that we're four times as many people who withdrew out of the workforce as the net new jobs created under this president.
And it's not just a1-month figure.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: The White House has I think now for 31 straight months said, well, just don't look at the monthly numbers. Monthly numbers aren't that critical. Well, if you take 30 months and put them together that's pretty critical. When you see what's happened across this country, the American people had expected the president to deliver on his promises because at the convention four years ago he laid out a lot of promises.
He said that he'd create jobs and instead we have unemployment now still over 8 percent for 43 straight months. He said by now it'd be down to 5.4 percent. Now, by the way, those numbers — 8.1., 5.4 — what difference do they make? Let me tell you what difference they make. The difference in those numbers is 9 million Americans working. That's the difference. And those are real people. Those are not just numbers. I was at a mine in Ohio. And a miner said to me, please save my job. And he had tears running down his face.
I met a woman at a rally. She came up and she said, I've been out of work for two years. Can you help me find a job? The same with a woman in Florida who said she'd been out of work for three years. She was a marketing executive and can't find work now. They were real people having real struggles because this economy hasn't created the 9 million jobs this president's plan was supposed to create.
And the reason it did not create jobs is because what the president did was not what it takes to make our economy work. He seems to think that if government gets larger and larger that that means that people are going to find jobs. That's not the answer. We need a private sector, entrepreneurs, innovators building enterprises and hiring people. (Applause.
)
You know, even people with jobs — even people with jobs, when the report comes out and you're one of those that has a job, that doesn't mean everything's just going swimmingly because if you look at what's happened over the last three years you see that the jobs we've lost have by in large been middle income jobs and the jobs that have replaced them have by in large been low wage jobs. And so the median income in America, instead of going up like the president said it would, has instead come down by $5,000 a family. And this is at the same time that health insurance premiums have gone up by $2,500. Utility bills have gone higher and food prices are higher. And of course, "Obamacare" costs, yeah, right — the bleachers up there.
And of course the cost of gasoline has doubled. All of these things have made it harder for middle income families, even those working. With lower wages and higher costs, middle income families are having a hard time. This president hasn't taken responsibility for what has been a failure of his economic policies. And it's one reason why he went up and gave a speech last night. I expected him to report, to come to the American people and say, when I ran four years ago, here are the promises I made and then describe why it was or why it was not that he was able to carry out his promise.
But he didn't talk about that. He said it was a whole new series of promises. He didn't deliver on the last ones. Why should we expect him to deliver on these? He has — [inaudible] [applause]. I want you to know that's the end of the bad news in my remarks, all right, because I'm absolutely confident the future is going to be bright for America. We're about to see — oh my goodness, up goes the cards again. It must be some words — [inaudible] [applause]
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: New Hampshire's doing it well tonight. [applause] :Let me tell you, this economy is going to come back in a big way and you're going to see more jobs again and you're going to see rising home values again and you're going to see more take-home pay again. But it is going to require me being elected president — [inaudible] [applause].
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: You know, I love that cheer. I love that chant because you're absolutely right. What's going to make this country come back are the principles of the United States of America, the principles that made us the hope of the Earth. [applause] And now it's going to come back with new leadership. I told you I'm going to do five things and I want you to know what they are so when your friends ask you why are you voting for Mitt Romney you can say, look, the things that he's going to do that are going to get this economy going.
And those five things are these. Number one, I'm going to take advantage of our energy: our oil, our coal, our gas — [inaudible] [applause]. And people say, well, what are you doing to do in energy? How are you going to do that? Well, first of all, the president cut in half the licensing and permitting on federal lands and federal waters. I'm going to double the permitting on federal lands and federal waters. [applause] And open up ANWR in the Gulf and the outer continental shelf and I'm going to get that pipeline in from Canada — [inaudible] [applause].
That's number one. Number two, I'm going to get trade to work for America. I want to open up new markets for our goods so we can sell things around the world and I want to crack down on cheaters when they cheat and steal our jobs. [applause] Number three, I'm going to fix our schools. We're finally going to put our kids first and the teachers first and the unions last. [applause] number four — number four, this may not immediately come to your mind as being a way to help create jobs but let me tell you, if the entrepreneurs that are here tonight and big companies that think about growing their enterprises and building new facilities, if they think that America is headed to become Greece or Spain or Italy, they're not going to risk their life's savings to invest in America. Right now, major corporations in this country — the big ones — have lots and lots of cash. Why aren't they investing? Why aren't they building?
AUDIENCE: Obama!
MR. ROMNEY: It's the policies of the president. And some of those policies are the massive debts that he keeps putting in place. These deficits — when he became president, there was $10 trillion of debt that our nation had — 10 trillion (dollars). That was all of the presidents combined got us to 10 trillion (dollars). He's now added 6 trillion (dollars) more. It's unthinkable.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: If I become president of the United States, I'm going to cut spending. We're going to get to a balanced budget. We're going to get America — [inaudible] [applause].
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: And I've got one more. I've got one more. And that last one is to be a champion of small business. [applause] This state and the history of this state — this state's economy has been driven by entrepreneurs, big and small, inventors as well as people who start a corner store and go to work and hire other people. That's the story of New Hampshire — the free people pursuing their dreams, building enterprises that put people to work. That's how this economy works and I'm going to make that the reality — [inaudible] [applause].
AUDIENCE: We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We want Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. Now, to make — to make a champion of small business, you have to have someone I believe who's actually worked in small business and I have. And I know that if government takes too big a slice of what the small business earns and they're not able to invest in their business and hire more people. And so I want to make sure we don't raise taxes on small business. The president wants to raise the marginal tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. That will kill jobs. I will not raise taxes on small business. [applause]
I want regulators to understand their job is not just to get the bad guys but also to encourage the good guys and make it easier for businesses to grow and thrive. [applause] And I want — I want to make sure that that big cloud hanging out over small business right now is pushed away. That big cloud is "Obamacare". We've got to get it out of the way. [applause] Three-quarters of the small businesses in this country that were surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce said they are less likely to hire people because of "Obamacare".
Look, we need to reform our health care system in America to make sure that we get the costs down of health care, the extraordinary inflation in health care is just crushing so many families. I met with one woman — a waitress here — she said she couldn't afford health insurance for herself and her son. And I want to focus on getting the cost of health care down. And one way to do that, by the way, is to finally deal with the malpractice costs that are scaring — [inaudible] [applause].
Now, I know if we do those five things — if we do those five things, I know enough to know that we'll see this economy take off again. And the reason — the reason I'm so confident of that is that I've seen the American people. I've had the chance to go across the country and meet people from all different states and walks of life. And there's a passion for this country which is inspiring.
You see it particularly in those men and women who volunteer to serve in our military forces. [applause] You're a patriotic people. We love this country. And we'll serve this country. That's one part of the American heart I've seen. I've also seen a can-do, innovative, creative, problem-solving kind of attitude that you see across this country. I was in Las Vegas and met Debbie Summers and she has a business that rents furniture to casinos and conventions. And from what I could tell — I was in her warehouse — it's mostly black sofas made out of naugahyde, you know, and black coffee tables.
And when the economy turned down, she wondered how she was going to keep in business and how she'd keep her employees employed. And she had this extraordinary creative idea. She said instead of just renting furniture, I'm going to manufacture it. And so she taught her people how to make naugahyde furniture.
And now — now they rent the furniture they manufacture and they sell it to other places as well.
Entrepreneurs, innovativeness, problem-solving, can-do — it's part of the American spirit. There's something else. The president made a big error the other day and you heard this error in Roanoke, Virginia, when —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Which one?
MR. ROMNEY: Which one, yeah. [laughter] He said something that was so contrary to the American experience it shocked people, regardless of their backgrounds, he said when you've got a business, you didn't build that. Someone else did that.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: Because the story of America and the story of New Hampshire, by the way, is of entrepreneurs of all kinds saying, I'm going to build it. and whether it's building a business or whether it's saying I'm going to build my career and get a promotion so I can do a better job providing for my family or whether it's a kid going to college saying I'm going to get the honor roll and prepare myself better, the people in this country take responsibility, individual initiative. They work hard and they build it. [applause]
A couple of my favorite experiences from the campaign trail — I'll just mention about people who have built. I was with a woman. She runs her own business. I said, how'd you get into business. And she said, well, you know, my husband lost his job and he took a class in upholstering. And she, because she was the better business-minded in the family, she decided to start her own company and hired him as her first employee. [laughter] And then, she went on to hire 39 more people as upholsterers. And now, she has the leading upholstery company. I thought, boy, isn't that remarkable and how much work it took for her to do that.
And then I met another guy name of Jim Liautaud from Southern Illinois. He graduated second in his class in high school — second from the bottom. [laughter] And Jim concluded that college was not in his future. So he went to his dad and asked him about a loan and his dad agreed to float him a loan and they agreed to split the business roughly 50/50. And Jim wanted to have a food business, a restaurant. And he went out to get the hamburger griddle and the hot dog rollers and, you know, the hood that takes out the smoke and all that.
And it was way more money to buy that stuff than he had in the loan. So he couldn't have the kind of restaurant he expected. But about the most he could afford was some tables and the ability to make sandwiches. So he got some tables and the fixings to make sandwiches and set up in a garage, make the sandwiches and then delivered them to people at work. Now, Jimmy John's Restaurants has 1,500 restaurants and employs 6,500 people. [applause]
It's a remarkable story. It's a remarkable nation we live in, where people are patriotic, where they're can-do and problem-solvers and where they want to build things themselves. Of course we benefit from our collective society and the greatness of America. But those elements of entrepreneurship and innovation and can-do and patriotism have made us the most powerful economy in the world. When the founders of this nation wrote the Declaration of Independence, they said things which changed the world and changed our lives. They said our rights came from God, not from the government, not from the king. [applause]
By the way, God is in the Declaration of Independence and in our lives. [applause] And among those rights were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In America, free people would be able to pursue happiness as they choose, not as directed by the king or the king's advisors or the government or the bureaucrats but instead free people would pursue those dreams. And as they did, some would be highly successful. And as they were successful, they would help lift the rest of the economy.
This freedom that we have relies on the individual capacity of Americans, not our government. Our government helps preserve our freedoms and lets the individuals lift the nation. That's who we are. So in fact we did build it. This is our country — [inaudible] [applause].
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: You guys are great. You're going to see this economy come roaring back. You're going to see America strong again. We're going to make sure we get the jobs that our kids deserve and that we deserve as adults. We're going to make sure that we have the capacity to maintain the strongest military in the world, one so strong no one will ever think of testing it. [applause]
I commit to you I will do everything in my power to make America strong, to restore our vitality and our economy, to restore the principles that made us who we are, to make sure our military is the strongest in the world forever. I will do those things with all my energy. But I need you to do something for me. I need a commitment from you. And that commitment is I need you to find one person who voted for Barack Obama. There are at least a couple here in New Hampshire. I want you to find someone who voted for Barack Obama last time and ask that person did he do what you thought he'd do.
Yeah, incomplete, he gave himself his own grade — incomplete. And if they feel, as you do, that the best day in Barack Obama's presidency was the day he got elected, if that is the best day — best time you felt about him was the day he got elected, if they've been disappointed ever since, then I want you to convince them that while they may think he's a terrific guy and a nice guy, that he just doesn't know what it takes to get America strong again. I do. [applause]
So I need your help. I need your help — [inaudible] [applause]. I love this country. Let's take back America. We're going to do great stuff in America — [inaudible] [applause] — and prosperous. You deserve it. Your kids deserve it. The world demands it. This is the greatest nation in the history of the Earth. Thank you so very much. [applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Virginia Beach, Virginia

September 8, 2012

Look at those flags! [applause] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Well, Virginia really knows how to say hello. Thank you! [applause] Thank you, Governor and Janine, for being here and welcoming me. And thanks to all of you for braving the warm weather today to give me such a welcome. And thanks to our veterans. I see a number of them in the audience here today. Thank you for your service. [applause]
You know, I know that this week has not been a week of a lot of good news. You saw the reports that we're not creating as many jobs as even would keep up with our population growth and you saw that for every net new job that was created last month, why, four people dropped out of the workforce. So this is not the kind of news that the American people were hoping for and deserved.
But I'm here to tell you that things are going to get a lot better. [applause] But that's going to require you doing something important and that's electing me the next president of the United States. [applause]
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: You know, it's moving to be in this place and to see these aircraft and know the men and the women that have helped defend liberty for America time and time again. It's moving to see that flag out there and to see the flags that you've been waving inside this room. I remember as a boy I was in the fourth grade and somehow in my mind I remember being there in the fourth grade in front of the blackboard. We had an American flag that was pinned above the blackboard.
And every day we stood, lined up in front of that blackboard and we recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Do you remember it? [applause] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [applause] When I make a promise, I intend to keep a promise and I've done that throughout my life. When I made that promise time and time again in my pledge of allegiance to the flag I remembered that flag and I remember it to this day
For me, the Pledge of Allegiance and placing our hand over our heart reminds us of the blood that was shed by our sons and our daughters fighting for our liberty and sharing liberty with people around the world. The promises that were made in that pledge are promises I plan on keeping if I'm president and I've kept them so far in my life. [applause] That pledge says under God. I will not take God out of the name of our platform. [applause]
I will not take God off our coins and I will not take God out of my heart. We're a nation — [applause] — bestowed by God. One nation, indivisible — I will not divide this nation. I will not apologize for America abroad and I will not apologize for Americans here at home. [applause] With liberty and justice for all — with liberty — I will not forget that for us to have liberty here, for us to be able to protect ourselves from the most evil around the world, for us to share liberty with our friends around the world, we must have a military second to none, so strong no one would ever think of testing it. [applause]
And I'm sure you know what's happening to our military. Our number of ships has gone from roughly 600 down — well, the Navy said they had to have at least 313 ships minimum to carry out the missions that are given to our Navy and we're already down to about 282, 283, something of that nature. And we're only creating about nine new ships a year. I'd increase that to 15 ships. Do you realize — [applause]. You realize our Navy is smaller than any time since 1917. That's unacceptable. It's time to have a rebuilding of our Navy to make sure it's the strongest in the world. [applause]
And it fulfills our missions. Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since 1947. Our troops have been stretched to the breaking point in the conflicts they've been enduring. And our hearts go to those that are in far off places today, particularly those in Afghanistan and who are harm's way. We love them. We respect them. We honor their sacrifice. [applause]
But to preserve liberty, we must have a commitment not just to more ships and more aircraft but also in my view to more members of our Armed Forces. I will not cut our military. I will maintain our military commitment. [applause] Now, I listened — you listened to the governor talk about the cuts the president has put in place for our military. And then the sequestration cuts that the White House came up with, this idea of sequestration — they came up with it.
According to a book that just came out from Bob Woodward, it was their idea. So we're talking about a trillion dollars in cuts. The estimates of the kinds of numbers of jobs lost in Virginia from these cuts is between a hundred and two hundred thousand. It's unthinkable. It's unthinkable to Virginia, to our employment needs. But it's also unthinkable to the ability and the commitment of America to maintain our liberty with liberty for all.
And therefore, if I'm president of the United States, we'll get rid of those sequestration cuts and rebuild America's military might. [applause] So with liberty for all but also with justice for all — with justice for all — I don't think it's just for the next generation for us to pass on massive debts that we've amassed and pass onto them. Sixteen trillion dollars in debt passed to them is wrong and it must end. [applause]
I also don't think it's justice for all when a nation is as prosperous as ours is — the most prosperous, major nation in the history of the Earth — to have one out of six people now who've fallen into poverty, 47 million people on food stamps. When the president took office, there were 32 million on food stamps, now 47 million. How can a nation — how can a nation so prosperous stand by with such a national tragedy? That is not justice for all.
Now with the unemployment level having stuck above 8 percent for 43 straight months, we remember that the president promised that if we let him borrow almost a trillion dollars he'd never let it reach 8 percent. It's been above 8 percent. This president has not fulfilled his promises. And then he went to the Democrat Convention and spoke at great length and had a lot of wonderful things to say. But he didn't say what he'd do to help people get jobs or come out of employment — out of unemployment or to get people that are poor back to the middle class.
He doesn't have a plan. He doesn't have any ideas. And we've got to make sure that he doesn't have any more days in the White House after January. [applause] We pledge allegiance to that flag. We believe in a nation under God, indivisible, a nation united, a nation with justice and liberty for all. And for that to happen, we're going to have to have a new president that will commit to getting America working again, that will commit to a strong military, that will commit to a nation under God, that recognizes that we the American people were given our rights not by government but by God Himself. [applause]
Now, unlike the president, you see, the president has promises and I have promises.
But the difference is that I have a plan to fulfill my promises. And so — and so I have — I have a plan to get America working again. And I know it's going to work because for me this is not something I studied in school. It's something I did for 25 years, all right? [applause] And so there are five parts to it.
Number one — and by the way, this is our ace in the hole. We've got extraordinary resources we haven't taken advantage of and I will. I'm going to get North America energy independent within eight years. [applause] And by the way, that means — that means instead of doing what the president did which is cutting in half the permits and licenses for onshore drilling and offshore drilling on federal lands, I'll double them. And I'm going to open up ANWR and the outer continental shelf. [applause] Yeah, let's not forget about building that pipeline in from Canada too. I'll do that too. [applause]
Number two, I'm going to make sure that our workers have the skills they need to succeed today and that our kids get the skills they need to succeed in a world where right now our kids are getting an education which puts them in the bottom third of the world. That's unacceptable. I will put the kids and their parents and the teachers first and the teachers union behind. [applause]
Number three, trade is good for us, by the way. It's good for us to sell things to other countries and to trade with them. You have to make sure, of course, that those trade agreements are structured in a way that it helps America, not just the other guys. Trade has to work for us and I'll do that opening up new markets for us. And when people cheat like China's cheating, I'm going to say, no, we're not going to let it go on. [applause]
Number four, we're not going to get entrepreneurs to risk their life savings to start a business or big companies — let's say even foreign companies coming here and building facilities here — unless they know we're not on a road to Greece. And so to preserve and to protect jobs and to create more investment in this country, I'm going to do something politicians have spoken about but your governor has done and I've done. Almost every governor in America does it and that is I'm going to cut spending and finally get America on to a balanced budget. [applause]
And number five — number five — number five, I'm going to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. [applause] So I'm not going to raise taxes on small business and I'm not going to overregulate small business. And I'm going to get rid of that big cloud that's been hanging over small business and keeps them from hiring. I'm going to get rid of "Obamacare" and replace it with something better. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: Look, this country's going to come roaring back. If you do those five things, this country's going to come roaring back. We're going to see 12 million new jobs and finally rising take-home pay again because I know if government is doing the job it ought to do to encourage freedom and entrepreneurship that the American people are ready to act. I've seen big companies that want to act and want to invest in America. I've seen entrepreneurs of all kinds that want to start businesses.
I've been impressed by the American spirit of people who are can-do and take charge, want to start and build things. And by the way, they do build it themselves. [applause] With those flags waving, I can't help but tell you just a story. I know it's warm for this experience but I've been touched by all these flags and the patriotism in this place today. And it happens to do with the Olympics that I had the chance to help organize back in 2002 out in Salt Lake City.
And at the end of the Games, Vice President Cheney came and he asked me to pick one athlete to represent all the athletes of America to sit with him in the closing ceremonies. And so, I chose Derrick Parra. Derrick's Hispanic American, born in L.A. He's a roller-blader, all right? and he had a friend say to him, Derrick, you're never going to get an Olympic medal with roller blades, all right? You've got to find another sport.
So Derrick decided to try ice skating and it turns out he was pretty fast. And he went on and competed. And you know, he beat these big guys from Michigan and Wisconsin and Minnesota and became a member of the U.S. speed skating team, came out there to Salt Lake City, skated his heart out. He won a silver medal in the — I think it was in the 1,000 meters and then a gold medal in the 5,000 meters — the other way around, gold in the 1,000 and silver in the 5,000 — fastest man in the world on ice.
I couldn't get over it. Derrick Parra's about 5'4, real strong guy, just amazing guy. So I invited him to sit with the vice president. He came in to sit down. I said — I said, Derrick, what was the most meaningful experience in your Olympics. I expected him to describe the race for the gold where he got the gold. Instead, he said, no, Mitt, it was being honored to carry in the flag that had flown above the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, into the opening ceremonies. [applause]
You see, that flag was flown above the World Trade Center. It was torn and burned and it's about 8 feet by 12 feet and Derrick Parra was one of the eight American athletes that was voted as one of those that should carry in that flag. And so, in fact he said that he took ahold of the flag and the announcer came over the PA system. And he said, ladies and gentlemen, the flag that flew above the World Trade Center at September the 11th is now coming into the stadium.
And Derrick said, I thought the crowd would burst into cheers but instead total silence, complete reverence. And he said, so we carried the flag and stopped in front of the choir and they began performing the national anthem. And he said, Mitt, it was hard to hold on to my emotions as I was singing those words and I was holding that flag. And then he said, the choir did something I hadn't expected.
Now, I knew it was coming because as the guy in charge of the Olympics, I chose the version of the national anthem they sang. And in the version I chose, you sing the last line twice. Second time is a reprise. You go up an octave. So the sopranos jumped up an octave, much greater orchestration: O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
And he said, Mitt, this time as they sang it, a gust of wind blew in the flag in our hands and it lifted in our arms. And he said, for me, it was as if the spirits of all those that had fought and died for liberty had just blown in that flag. And he said, the tears ran down my face.
We're a patriotic people. The American people love this country. We love that flag. We love our pledge. We love our God. [applause] Any challenge we face is a challenge we're going to overcome. But we need a new president to get America back on track. I expect to build a new future, a strong future for this country and take back America. I love America. I love you. I love the work you do. I'll protect this land and keep it strong and create the future for your kids they deserve. Thank you so very much! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Mansfield, Ohio

September 10, 2012

Thank you. Thank you. What a welcome from the Buckeye State. Thank you so much! [cheers and applause]
[inaudible] — listening to Mark and listening to your senator here. You are so lucky to have a terrific senator, Rob Portman — [inaudible] — thank you, Rob — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
Mike Romanchuk, he built this place. [inaudible] [cheers and applause]
I heard the strains of a beautiful musical number a moment ago, strains of the National Anthem. Who sang that? Is she here? Right there. Is that you — [inaudible]? That was beautiful. Thank you so very much. [cheers and applause]
I also heard you pledge allegiance to the flag. [cheers and applause]
[cheers and applause]
(I remember ?) doing that as a boy in fourth grade. This is — [inaudible]. Do sit down, by the way. You got — [inaudible] — and I'd like to (thank you ?) for standing up all day.
And she brought us up in front of the blackboard. We stand straight. And she would have us pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.
And I'm (honored ?) by the promises. One of those promises was the one that I made — the ones that I made in the Pledge of Allegiance. I believe it's important to have a president — and I would be a president, if elected, that honors that pledge — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
That pledge says that we are a nation under God. And if I'm president of the United States — [cheers and applause] — [inaudible] — president of the United States, I will not take God — [inaudible] — I will not take God out of the public (square ?), and I will not — [inaudible] — [cheers and applause].
[inaudible] — says we're one nation, indivisible, one nation, the story of America has bene a story of the many — [inaudible] — one, united in purpose. America (has built ?) strongest economy in the world united. United America — [inaudible] — unspeakable darkness, and — and foreign places have fought back against that darkness and allowed democracy and freedom to — to thrive. Americans united have accomplished extraordinary things for the (history ?) of this planet. And I'll tell you one thing: I will not — [inaudible] — as I see the president — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
(Off mic) — with liberty for all. With liberty for all. Liberty here and liberty around the world is protected in large measure by the strength of the military of the United States of America. And I will make sure our military remains second to none and is so strong no one will think of testing it. [cheers and applause]
It's hard for me to understand how the president would have as his intentions not only reducing our military through cuts in his budget, but also proceeding with a sequestration program which will cost — cost about a trillion dollars for our military — [inaudible].
This sequestration idea emanated from the White House, and it will result in the loss of thousands and thousands and hundreds of precious jobs across this country. If you add — once it goes forward, it would also be bad for our national security. If I'm president of the United States, I will not cut our military budget, I will preserve it and keep America's military strong. [cheers and applause]
You know — you know, as part of the sequestration law — the law that will be signed, the president — [inaudible] — it requires the president of the United States to specify specifically what cuts he's going to make to the military. I know it's an election year, and so he hasn't — [inaudible] — do with the law. Even though the law he signed requires he has to put out those cuts. He won't describe all the jobs that are going to be lost. [inaudible] — probably until after the election.
You see, we found one secret related to national security that he's willing to keep. [laughter]
[inaudible] — [cheers and applause] — there's another secret he's willing to keep — [inaudible] — national security and that is the flexibility he's willing to give Russia — [inaudible]. (Groans, boos.)
Now there's another (measure ?) of our national anthem, and it says this: with justice for all, not just for liberty — with liberty for all but also with justice for all.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: In my view, it is not just for my generation to rack up a trillion-dollar debts every year and pass those debts on to our kids. [cheers and applause] That is not right, it's wrong, it's immoral, and it's unjust, and it must end. [cheers and applause]
I also I don't believe it's just for us as a nation, the most prosperous nation on earth, to — [inaudible] — so many people struggling without work and struggling in poverty when with our prosperity and with the right principles, the principles that built our economy, we can put people back to work. We today have 23 million Americans out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. These are real families. These are real people. It breaks your heart to meet these people. I've seen them at (that ?) — been in events like this and shaken hands with a miner who said, please help me keep my job. I was with a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, both of them concerned about their future; was with a woman in Florida who's been out of work for — I think she said three years — two or three years!
These are tough times for the American people, and it doesn't have to be this way. We can do better than this. The kind of president the American people need is a president who will go to work to — [inaudible] — an economy, put Americans back to work — [cheers and applause] — and I will. [cheers and applause]
You know, I was surprised when I heard his speech at the Democratic Convention. He didn't mention unemployment. [laughter] He didn't mention 47 million people on food stamps. By the way, that's a record number, and not a good record. When he took office, there were 32 million people on food stamps, now 47 million, 1-out-of-6 Americans living in poverty. These are not numbers or people he spoke about during his convention speech.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's not Bush's fault!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, it's — yeah. [laughter and applause] Not only did he not mention those people, he did not mention what he would do to help people get back to work. He does not have a plan. His idea is that "Obamacare" and the stimulus are all we need. I don't want "Obamacare," and I don't want another stimulus — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause] He — [inaudible] — campaign slogan. You know what it is. He says, "Forward. "Forward" in his campaign slogan. I think "forewarned" is a better term. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)
We know what would happen if he were re-elected. We would see more years of lagging employment. We'd see more years of massive deficits. We'd see more years of all — [inaudible] — this country. We'd see more years of — [inaudible] — the kind of crisis you see in Europe. We're forewarned, and that's why we're not going to re-elect this man — [inaudible] — [cheers and applause] — create jobs and prosperity. We don't want four more years of the last four years.
And I have a plan. [inaudible] — saying to the rest of America to get the kind of jobs we need again. Five parts to my plan.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tell us!
MR. ROMNEY: Five things I'll do. Thank you for asking. Number one — [laughter] — I am going to take advantage of our energy resources, our coal and our oil, our gas — [cheers and applause] — our nuclear, our renewables.
I'm going to take advantage of energy. [inaudible] — coal. Let's use our coal. We've got a lot of it. Let's use — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
I'm going to make sure that — [inaudible] — natural gas, again extraordinary resources of natural gas. (I don't want ?) the regulators to stop us from being able to use that. I also want to be able to drill on public lands — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause] I'll double the rate of drilling for oil, for gas — [inaudible] — resources! [cheers and applause]
That's number one, energy. And we could have North American energy independence within eight years. When I say North American energy independence, I say — [inaudible] — that pipeline from Canada — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause] [inaudible] — that's number one, of course, energy.
Number two relates to three. I want to be able to sell goods around the world. We're a productive nation. And you're going to see, by the way, more manufacturers come back to this country. I was talking to Mark before we came in. He said, you know, we're seeing jobs come back. [inaudible] — purchasers of manufactured products expect those products to be made here instead of overseas.
We can bring manufacturing back, (create work for Americans ?), but we have to crack down on cheaters like China — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
Number three, we have to make sure that our workers have the skills that they need to be successful and to be competitive globally. So I'm not going to just have more government training programs, I'm going to work together with manufacturers and others — [inaudible] — to make sure that we get workers the skills they need. Ann by the way, I want our kids to have the skills they need for the challenges — [inaudible] — [cheers and applause] — I want our kids — [inaudible] — behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four, you're not going to see entrepreneurs risk their life savings — [inaudible] — business or big companies overseas — [inaudible] — factory unless they are confident we're not going to find ourselves — [inaudible] — with Greece, because if we keep on spending a trillion dollars more a year than we take in, that's where we're headed. And the people (will ?) understand that.
And this president has not been willing to deal with the present crisis. He's not been willing to deal with the deficit. As a matter of fact, this — these numbers — [inaudible]. We he came into office we had $10 trillion in debt. That's all of the prior presidents combined — [inaudible] — 10 trillion (dollars). In four years he added 6 trillion (dollars). We now have $16 trillion of deficit. [boos]
If I become president, I will cut our spending. I will get on track to a balanced budget. It's the right thing to do for our economy — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
And one more, number five, number five, I want to champion small business — [cheers and applause] — [inaudible]. And I'm going to do first of all by — [inaudible] — that very simple truth, and that is it takes enormous risk to build a business. It takes heart and passion and vision.
It takes a lot of people coming together who are working in the enterprise. But most of all, I recognize that the people who achieve great things in this country, whether it's the kid that goes on the honor roll or the worker that gets the promotion or the — [inaudible] — or the person who builds a business, I recognize they built it. They did, and the government didn't. [cheers and applause]
And so we're going to build small business again. We're going to encourage small business in America. Two-thirds of the jobs created in our economy are created by small business. President Obama wants to raise taxes on small business. I want to lower taxes on small business. [cheers and applause] I want regulations for the small — lower on small business. And I want to get rid of "Obamacare" because it's killing jobs and small business. [cheers and applause]
Look, the president — the president correctly said in his speech that America has a choice, a very dramatic and significant choice. I think that's absolutely right. We know what that choice is as it relates to our military. His plan is to cut our military massively, something even our secretary of defense — his secretary of defense has said it would be devastating. But that's the path he wants to put us on.
He wants to raise taxes on small business. That's the path he's put us on. He's increased regulation massively on small business. That's the path he's put us on.
He has "Obamacare" that he will install — [booing] — [inaudible] --health care — [inaudible]. That's the path he's put us on. He's cut Medicare — he's cut Medicare about $760 billion to pay for "Obamacare." That's the path he's put us on.
He wants fundamentally transform America. [boos] I don't want America to become something new.
I want America to become something better. I will make it better by restoring the principles that made America the powerful and proud nation that we are. [cheers and applause]
I love this country. I love the prospects of a free and prosperous land. I know we can bring those principles, we can bring those prospects back. I'm absolutely convinced that that plan I just described to you, those five points — we put them into place and this economy is going to come back. We're going to start creating jobs again. You're going to see a — [inaudible] — balanced budget. That's actually going to hit the realm of reality, all right? That's going to happen. We're going to get Americans to work with higher wages again. And you're going to be confident that child's future is brighter even than your — than your past. America does not have to have the long face we have right now, and as the president, we can get America going again, growing again. I know how to do it. [cheers and applause] I'm calling on you for your help. I need Ohio to help me become the next president. We're going to take a step forward to keep this nation strong and keep America the hope of the earth. [cheers and applause]
Thank you so very much. You guys are the best. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Ohio! We're going to get it done. Thank you! [cheers and applause]

Remarks at the 134th National Guard Association of the United States General Conference and Exhibition in Reno, Nevada

September 11, 2012

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, please. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Major General Vavala, thank you for your generous introduction and thank you for your years of service as chairman of the board and for your decades of service to our nation.
Ladies and gentlemen of the National Guard Association, it's an honor to be with you on this day of memorial and of appreciation. We remember with heavy hearts the tragic loss of life, and we express thankfulness for the men and women who responded to that tragedy. We honor them, and we honor those who secure our safety even to this day.
We honor the men and women of the National Guard. For 375 years, whenever your countrymen have encountered threat and danger, you have willingly gone. Wherever the cause of freedom has called, you have answered. And as the threats to liberty have emanated from distant lands, you've served far from home and far from family.
The nation has asked much of you, much more than had been expected. But you never faltered, never wavered from your mission, from that motto: "Always ready, always there."
Several weeks ago I saw the guard in action in Louisiana after it was hit by Hurricane Isaac. For many people of the Gulf who had just finished repairing their homes and getting life back to normal after Katrina, the damage from Isaac felt like too much to bear. As I toured the flooded streets, I was not surprised to find the guard keeping order, distributing water and supplies, and caring for many of those who had been evacuated and — and rescued.
Time and again, it has been the guardsman's hand that has lifted a child from rising waters, that has rescued a family from a hurricane's fury and that has fed and clothed a fellow American whose home and possessions have been lost to nature's devastation. It's a guardsman who took out Saddam Hussein's tanks from his A-10 and who fought the secure the villages of Afghanistan. Thank you for that service. [applause]
As you know too well, our world is a dangerous place, and the attack on our homeland and citizens on September 11th, 2001, reminds us that the mission of the guard is ever more critical and ever more deserving of our support and honor.
More than a decade has now passed since that day of tragedy, but the visions and the events are seared in the memory of every American. We remember those who died. We marvel at the courage of those who stormed the cockpit when they became aware of the malevolent purpose of the hijackers. We hold up in prayer the families and friends who've lived in a shadow cast by grief. We draw strength from the selflessness of the first responders, and we renew our resolve to protect America from the designs of evil men.
Like you, I remember where I was on September 11th. I was originally planning to be in Battery Park in New York City, not far from the World Trade Center itself. But as it turned out, I was in Washington, D.C., to meet with members of Congress about preparations for the security of the upcoming Olympic Winter Games. A colleague and I were working in the office we had in the Ronald Reagan building. It was just a few blocks from the White House.
Someone rushed into our office and said that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. I turned on the small TV on our desk there and — and watched in shock as the flames and smoke erupted from the north tower. I called my wife, Ann. She too watched the tragedy from her TV and wondered how a plane could fly into a building in clear daylight. And then we saw the second plane crash into the second tower. These then were purposeful attacks. These were terrorist attacks. These were evil and cowardly and heinous attacks.
Leaving the city, I — I drove towards Alexandria. The highway I was on came within a few hundred yards of the Pentagon, which had been hit by then. Cars were stopped where they were, and people had gotten out, watching in horror.
I could smell burning fuel and concrete and steel. It was the smell of war, something I never imagined I would smell in America. In our own ways, we each were overwhelmed by the enormity of the loss of life. We struggled to comprehend the magnitude of what this meant for the families of those who had been killed, and for our own families, for our nation, for the world. For some, there was also anger.
But grief and anger soon turned to action. And among those taking the lead were members of the National Guard. Members of the guard secured our airports and borders, and members of the guard began to mobilize, to deploy half a world away, where you would become all too familiar with the mountains of the Hindu Kush and the streets of Fallujah. Throughout the last 11 years, guardsmen and women have helped keep us safe from attack, and the nation owes you a great debt of gratitude.
I wish I could say the world is less dangerous now, that it's less chaotic. I wish I could predict with certainty the threats we'll face in the years ahead. But on September 10th, 2001, we had no idea that America would be at war in Afghanistan someday. In December of 2010, we had no idea that a Tunisian street vendor would inspire a revolution that would topple three dictators. We live in a time of turbulence and disruption. What I can say with certainty is that we need the National Guard's vigilance and strength now as much as ever before.
With less than two months to go before Election Day, I would normally speak to a gathering like this about the differences between my and my opponent's plans for military and for our national security.
There is a time and place for that, but this day is not that. It is instead a day to express gratitude to the men and women who fought, and who are still fighting, to protect us and our country, including those who traced the trail of terror to that walled compound in Abbottabad, and the SEALs who delivered justice to Osama bin Laden. [applause]
This is also a day in which all of us in this convention hall and in this campaign and in this country can hopefully agree on important things. This century must be an American century. It began with terror, war and economic calamity. It is now our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace and prosperity.
America must lead the free world, and the free world must lead the entire world. In our dealings — [applause] — in the dealings we have with other nations, we must demonstrate confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in the application of our military might. For this to be an American century, we must have a military that is second to none, that is so strong, no one would ever think of testing it. [applause]
American military power is vital to the preservation of our own security and for the preservation of peace around the world. Time and again America's military has been the best ally of liberty and peace. American forces rescued Europe twice. American forces stood up to brutal dictators and freed millions living under tyranny. America's military leads the fight against terrorism around the world, and it secures the global commons to keep them safe for the trade and commerce that are vital to lifting people from poverty.
While the war in Iraq is over, nearly 70,000 American troops will still remain in Afghanistan at the end of the month. Our goals should be to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. We should evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders. We can all agree that our men and women in the field deserve a clear mission, that they deserve the resources and resolute leadership they need to complete that mission and that they deserve a country that will provide for their needs when they come home. [applause]
Of course, the return of our troops cannot and must not be used as an excuse to hollow out our military through devastating defense budget cuts. [applause] It is true that our armed forces have been stretched to the brink, and that's all the more reason to repair and rebuild. We can always find places to end waste, but we cannot cancel program after program, we cannot jeopardize critical missions, and we cannot cut corners in the quality of the equipment and training we provide to our men and women in uniform. [applause]
We've got to recognize that when our troops come home, they should not have to struggle to find work.
After all our veterans have done for us, they deserve the opportunity to find good jobs and the dignity of pursuing of the American dream. [cheers and applause]
We've also got to keep the faith with our veterans, no matter when or where they've served, through a strong VA system. When the backlog for disability claims reaches nearly a million, when a federal building in Virginia becomes structurally unstable because so many claims have piled up on its highest floor, then we can all agree that the system is in need of serious and urgent reform — and it is. [applause]
Our veterans deserve care and benefits that are second to none. Here there's considerable work waiting to be done. The backlog of disability claims need to be — needs to be eliminated, the unconscionable waits for mental health treatment need to be dramatically shortened and the suicide rate among active-duty soldiers and veterans must be treated like the emergency it is. Veterans' benefits are not a gift that is given, but a debt that is due. [applause]
The problems with the VA are serious and they've got to be fixed. We're in danger of another generation of veterans losing their faith in the VA system, so we must ensure that the VA keeps faith with all our veterans. We must keep our promises and regain the trust of all those who've worn the uniform and served our country.
When I was governor of Massachusetts, I saw firsthand the guard's bravery and valor. In 2006 I visited Iraq and Afghanistan along with two other governors. We met with the members of the National Guard from our respective states and were flown by helicopter from base to base. I said to them that if they wanted me to call their spouse or their family when I got home, I'd be happy to do that; just hand me a note with your name and their names and phone numbers.
And so when I left for home, I found that I had 63 notes in my pocket, 63 calls to make. I — I knew that making that many calls would take quite a few days or weeks.
I returned home on Memorial Day weekend, and I decided to start making just a couple of calls first thing in the morning, before my kids and grandkids got up. After I'd made only two or three calls, a guardsman's wife answered the phone, and she said this: Oh, hello, Governor. I thought that might be you calling. [laughter]
Now apparently, the first spouses I called had called other spouses or they'd emailed their loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan, who then emailed their spouses back home to tell them to expect my call. So I made 63 calls on Memorial Day. [laughter and applause]
Now you'll remember that May of 2006 was a difficult time in the Iraq War. Many of you know that from experience. We were suffering terrible casualties, and terrorism was straining our efforts to stand up the Iraqi government.
The surge had not yet begun, and the politics back home had become very deeply divided.
And so as I made those calls, I braced myself for questions about why the guardsmen I had met couldn't come home right away. Why were they still there? And yet in 63 calls, I did not hear a single complaint, not one. On each call, I would end by expressing my gratitude on behalf of our nation and my state for the sacrifice of their loved one and of their family, these individuals in harm's way, so far away.
And then from virtually everyone I spoke with, they would correct me to say instead that it was an honor to be able to sacrifice for America and to serve the greatest nation on earth. [applause] Such is the patriotism of the men and women and families of our National Guard.
Many of those calls left me with tears in my eyes. I'll never forget meeting the brave men and women who had volunteered for the National Guard in Massachusetts, who found themselves on the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan. I'll never forget speaking with their loved ones. And I'll always hold the greatest admiration for every one of them.
On the campaign trail, it's been my privilege to meet with troops and veterans from just about every corner of America. They come from our farms, our great cities, our small towns and quiet neighborhoods. Many have known violence so their neighbors could know peace.
They have done more than protect America; their courage and service defines America. [applause]
On this 11th anniversary of September 11th of 2001, we remember the victims who perished in the attacks. We also remember the men and women serving in dangerous places around the world. We will not forget why they are fighting or who they are fighting for. They are faithful to us and to our country. We must not break faith with them.
I want to personally thank you for keeping us safe. It's inspiring to be in the company of men and women of the National Guard, men and women of courage that I stand before today. It's an honor to be among those who — whose sense of duty and love of country lift our hearts and our spirits.
We're blessed to live in a country where freedom is so highly cherished, where it is so fiercely protected and where it's so admirably defended by the noble men and women of the National Guard. I respect you. I admire you. I respect and admire the men and women who serve with you. You are a great force for good in America and in the world. Our debt of gratitude can never be repaid expect by saying, God bless you, God bless the United States of America, and God bless the great people of the National Guard. Thank you so very much. [applause]

Remarks on the Attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya and an Exchange with Reporters in Jacksonville, Florida

September 12, 2012

Americans woke up this morning with — with tragic news and felt heavy hearts as they considered that individuals who have served in our diplomatic corps were brutally murdered across the world.
This attack on American individuals and embassies is outrageous. It's disgusting. It — it breaks the hearts of all of us who think of these people who have served during their lives the cause of freedom and justice and honor. We mourn their loss and join together in prayer that the spirit of the Almighty might comfort the families of those who have been so brutally slain.
Four diplomats lost their life, including the U.S. ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, in the attack on our embassy at Benghazi, Libya. And of course, with these words, I extend my condolences to the grieving loved ones who have left behind as a result of these who have lost their lives in the service of our nation. And I know that the people across America are grateful for their service, and we mourn their sacrifice.
America will not tolerate attacks against our citizens and against our embassies. We'll defend, also, our constitutional rights of speech and assembly and religion. We have confidence in our cause in America. We respect our Constitution. We stand for the principles our Constitution protects. We encourage other nations to understand and respect the principles of our Constitution, because we recognize that these principles are the ultimate source of freedom for individuals around the world.
I also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. It's never too early for the United States government to condemn attacks on Americans and to defend our values. The White House distanced itself last night from the statement, saying it wasn't cleared by Washington, and that reflects the mixed signals they're sending to the world.
The attacks in Libya and Egypt underscore that the world remains a dangerous place and that American leadership is still sorely needed. In the face of this violence, America cannot shrink from the responsibility to lead. American leadership is necessary to ensure that events in the region don't spin out of control. We cannot hesitate to use our influence in the region to support those who share our values and our interests.
Over the last several years we stood witness to an Arab Spring that presents an opportunity for a more peaceful and prosperous region but also poses the potential for peril if the voices — forces of extremism and violence are allowed to control the course of events. We must strive to ensure that the Arab Spring does not become an Arab winter.
With that, I'm happy to take any questions you may have.
Steve.
Q: The statement you refer to was very —[inaudible]— last night —[inaudible]— given what we know now?
MR. ROMNEY: I — the embassy in Cairo put out a statement after their grounds had been breached. Protesters were inside the grounds. They reiterated that statement after the breach. I think it's a terrible course to — for America to stand in apology for our values, that instead when our grounds are being attacked and being breached, that the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation. And apology for America's values is never the right course.
Q: Governor Romney, do you think, though, coming so soon after the events really had unfolded overnight, it was appropriate to be weighing in on this as this crisis is unfolding in real time?
MR. ROMNEY: The White House also issued a statement saying it tried to distance itself from those comments and said they were not reflecting of their views. I had the exact same reaction. These views were inappropriate, they were the wrong course to take. When our embassy is — has been breached by protesters, the first response should not be to say, yes, we stand by our comments that suggest that there's something wrong with the right of free speech.
Q: So what did the White House do wrong then, Governor Romney, if they — if they put out a statement saying —
MR. ROMNEY: It's their administration — their administration spoke. The president takes responsibility not just for the words that come from his mouth but also from the words that come from his ambassadors, from his administration, from his embassies, from his State Department. They clearly — they clearly sent mixed messages to the world. And — and the statement that came from the administration — and the embassy is the administration — the statement that came from the administration was a — was a statement which is akin to apology and I think was a — a — a severe miscalculation.
Q: Governor, some —
Q: Talk about mixed signals —[inaudible]— itself a mixed signal when you criticize the administration at a time —[inaudible]?
MR. ROMNEY: We're — we have a campaign for presidency of the United States and are speaking about the different courses we would each take with regards to the challenges that the world faces. The president and I, for instance, have differences of opinion with regards to Israel and our policies there, with regards to Iran, with regards to Afghanistan, with regards to Syria. We have many places of distinction and differences.
We joined together in the condemnation of the attacks on American embassies and the loss of American life and joined in the sympathy for these people. But it's also important for me — just as it was for the White House last night, by the way — to say that the statements were inappropriate and, in my view, a disgraceful statement on the part of our administration to apologize for American values.
Q: Governor, some people are saying you jumped the gun a little in putting that statement out last night and that you should have waited until more details were available. Do you regret having that statement come out so early, before we learned about all the things that were happening?
MR. ROMNEY: I don't think we ever hesitate when we see something which is a violation of our principles. We express immediately when we feel that the president and his administration have done something which is inconsistent with the principles of America. Simply put, having an embassy which is — has been breached and has protesters on its grounds, having violated the sovereignty of the United States — having that embassy reiterate a statement effectively apologizing for the right of free speech is not the right course for an administration.
Q: Governor Romney, if you had known —
STAFF: Last question.
Q: If you had known last night that the ambassador had died — and obviously, I'm gathering you did not know —
MR. ROMNEY: Well, that came — that came later.
Q: That's right. If you had known that the ambassador had died, would you have issued —
MR. ROMNEY: I'm not going — I'm not going to take hypotheticals about what would have been known when and so forth.
We responded last night to the events that happened in Egypt.
Q: Governor, what sort of —
Q: Governor Romney, your — one of your professed reasons for running is your economic know-how and your private sector experience. But now that foreign policy and the situation in the Middle East —[off mic]— the presidential campaign, can you talk about why, specifically, you think you're better qualified than President Obama —[off mic]?
MR. ROMNEY: I think President Obama has demonstrated a lack of clarity as to a foreign policy. My foreign policy has three fundamental branches: first, confidence in our cause, a recognition that the principles America was based upon are not something we shrink from or apologize for, that we stand for those principles; the second is clarity in our purpose, which is that when we have a foreign policy objective, we describe it honestly and clearly to the American people, to Congress and to the people of the world; and number three is resolve in our might, that in those rare circumstances, those rare circumstances where we decide it's essential for us to apply military might, that we do so with overwhelming force, that we do so in the clarity of a mission, understanding the nature of the U.S. interest involved, understanding when the mission would be complete, what will be left when it is — what will be left behind us when that mission has been — has been terminated.
These elements, I believe, are essential to our foreign policy, and I haven't seen them from the president. As I watched — as I've watched over the past three and a half years, the president has had some successes. He's had some failures. It's a hit-or-miss approach, but it has not been based upon sound foreign policy.
Q: Governor Romney, how, specifically — how, specifically, Governor Romney, would President Romney have handled this situation differently than President Obama did? Before midnight, when all the facts were known. How would you have handled it differently than the president did?
MR. ROMNEY: I spoke out when the key fact that I referred to was known, which was that the Embassy of the United States issued what appeared to be an apology for American principles. That was a mistake. And I believe that when a mistake is made of that significance, you speak out.
Thank you.

MR. ROMNEY: You guys are the best, I'll tell you. And — and you give me such a boost of energy and optimism. I'm excited about our future.
I know that we have heavy hearts across America today. And I want you to know things are going to get a lot better, but I also recognize that right now we're — we're in mourning. We've lost four of our diplomats across the world.
We're — we're thinking about their families and — and those that they've left behind. What a tragedy to lose such a wonderful — wonderful —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]
MR. ROMNEY: — wonderful people — [inaudible] — and appreciate their — their service for the country. [cheers]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: And so — and I would — I would offer a moment of silence, but one gentleman doesn't want to be silent, so we're going to keep — we're going to keep on going.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: Let me talk about something else. And that is, today we saw the — the headlines in the — in USA Today. And they said that the median income in America has (grown ?) by $4,300 for a family. [boos] So these are — these are tough times for American families that have work, and then you have 23 million people who are out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed. These are — these are tough times.
But you know what? Your optimism is my optimism. America is coming back. We're going to make sure that we have the jobs that we need. America is going to remain strong. And we're going to make sure that we remain the hope of the earth. [cheers and applause]
Now, a strong America is essential to the world. It's essential to us and to our future but also to the world. I — I was in Poland a few weeks ago, and I — I met with Lech Walesa, a world hero, and — (scattered cheers, applause) — and he — he saw me come in, and — and through an interpreter, he said, you must be tired, you've come from across the ocean. He said, you sit, I talk, you listen. And — [laughter] — abrupt and to the point.
And he said this time and time again, he said, the world needs American leadership. Where is American leadership? We need a strong America. Where is American leadership?
And I intend to lead and to have an America that's strong, that helps lead the world. [cheers and applause]
As we — as we watch the world today, sometimes it seems that we're at the mercy of events instead of shaping events. And a strong America's essential to shape events. And a strong America, by the way, depends on a strong military. We have to have a military — [cheers and applause] — we have to have a military second to none and that's so strong, no one would ever think of testing it.
This president has done something I find very hard to understand. Ever since FDR, we've had the capacity to be engaged in two conflicts at once. And he's saying no, we're going to cut that back to only one conflict. [boos] And so he's put in place cuts of almost a trillion dollars, but with his budget cuts and the sequestration cuts, we'll have almost a trillion dollars of cuts to our military. [boos] If I'm president of he United States, we will restore our military commitment and keep America the strongest military in the world. [cheers and applause]
The world needs American leadership. The Middle East meeds — needs American leadership, and I intend to be a president that provides the leadership that America respects and — and will keep us admired throughout the world. [cheers and applause]
Now for us to have a strong military, of course you have to have a strong economy.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!
MR. ROMNEY: And people have to be able to get good jobs. And our veterans coming home deserve those good jobs.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!
MR. ROMNEY: And so I would have expected that — with 23 million Americans out of work or having stopped looking for work or underemployed, I would have expected that when the president gave his address at the convention a couple weeks ago, that he would have spoken about the unemployed. But he didn't. I expected him to talk about a plan to get people back to work. Oh, he talks about where he wants to get, but not how to get there. And we've watched him for the last four years, and what he has done has not helped. It has led to $4,300 decline in median income. It's led to unemployment being of — of 8 percent for 43 straight months.
It's led to a larger and larger gap between the wealthier and the rest of America.
His policies have not worked. How in the world he can go before a Democrat convention and speak to the nation and offer nothing but more of the same is beyond me. We want real change. I'm going to bring real change and get America working again. [cheers and applause]
I listened — I looked at that — at the text of his speech at the convention. I expected there to be some new ideas in there. There are no new ideas. He's got — he's out of ideas, he's out of excuses, and we — you're going to make sure in November you put him out of office. [cheers and applause]
Now, there are five things — there are five things in my plan that will get America working again and keep us so strong we can have a military that's second to the world — second to none in the world. And let me tell you what those five things are. You may have heard them before, but if you haven't, you got to memorize them. I'm kidding. [laughter]
Number one. Number one, we have an ace in the hole. We have a chance — we have a special advantage in America, a number of them, but one in particular that hasn't been taken full advantage of that's going to get this economy going in a big hurry, and that is, we have a lot of energy. I'm going to take advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. America's going to become — North America will be energy independent within eight years. [cheers and applause]
And let me tell you how I'd do that, by the way. This is not just a dream. This you can do. The president has cut in half permitting and licensing on federal lands and in federal waters. I'll double it. The president has said no to drilling in ANWR. I'll open up ANWR. [cheers and applause] I want to make sure we can drill in the Outer Continental Shelf, where there states like Virginia want to do that.
[cheers and applause]
I want to make sure we use our natural gas. We have massive resources of natural gas. It's cheap. It's plentiful. We want to get it to the places that can use it. Using natural gas not just to heat our homes and power our factories but — but also as a transportation fuel will help us become energy independent.
And one more thing: I will make sure we get that pipeline from Canada and get oil that we can use and need. [cheers and applause]
So number one, we're going to take advantage of our energy, and that's going to create millions of jobs not just in the energy sector but also in manufacturing, other places that use energy. That's going to help us create jobs.
Number two, we're going to make trade work for America. What do I mean by that? We're going to — we're going to open up new markets for our goods and expand our — our reach into other parts of the world where other nations are now competing. I want to make sure our goods can go throughout the world.
But I also want to make sure that if a nation cheats like China has cheated, we call them on the carpet and don't let it continue. [cheers and applause] And the — and the cheating — the cheating takes on a lot of different dimensions. I mean, cheating occurs if you hold down your currency. You might wonder, what in the world has that got to do with jobs here? Let me tell you: When China manipulates their currency by holding down the value of their currency compared to ours, what it does is makes their products in this country artificially cheap. And that then drives American manufacturers and American producers out of business and kills jobs.
The president's had the chance year after year to label — to label China a currency manipulator, but he hasn't done so. And I will label China the currency manipulator they're — they are on the first day. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: Let me tell you what else they do. They take technology from America. They steal our technology. They hack into our computers. They also steal our know-how, our patents. Did you know they even have an Apple store? It's a fake Apple store. They sell counterfeit Apple products.
This is wrong. We're going to crack down on China when they manipulate their currency, when they steal our goods, when they don't protect our intellectual property. We're going to make sure that China understands we mean business. Trade is going to work for us, not just for them. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: So number one is energy, and number two is trade. And number three, education. We've got to help people get the skills they need for the jobs of today, and we got to make sure our schools are competitive with the world. We can't continue to have schools in the bottom third of the world. I want to make sure we put our kids and the teachers and the parents first and we put the unions behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four, number four, we're not going to have entrepreneurs go out and start a small business or big businesses decide to build new factories in America if we think we're headed to the road to Greece. This spending massively more than we take in every year is killing jobs. It's one more reason why it's essential for us to cut back on the size of the federal government and live within our means. I will get America on track to a balanced budget. It's essential to getting the job growth we need. [cheers and applause]
And one more, one more, let me mention. And that's, we need to champion small business. [cheers] We need small business to grow and feel like this is the right place for them to risk and to hire people and to expand. Small business has been crushed under these last 3 1/2 years. We're at a 30-year low in the number of new business startups in America.
You realize about two-thirds of the new jobs created in this country are — are created by small business. The president wants to raise taxes on a million of them. I don't want to raise taxes. I'd rather keep taxes down.
Regulation — look, regulations, big companies can deal with, but small companies get crushed by regulation. We've got to ease the regulatory burden on small business, and we got to take off that big cloud that's scaring small businesses from hiring. We have got to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with something that works to get the cost of health care down. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! Thank you, Mitt!
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: If we do those five things — if we do those five things I'm talking about, we're going to create about 12 million jobs in the next four years. You're going to see Americans to work again. And by the way, we're going to see rising wages again too because there's going to be competition to try and hire people. That's what drives wages up. I want higher wages and more take-home pay for the American people. I don't want people getting crushed by higher costs and lower salaries and lower wages and lower take-home pay. That's my plan.
Now, I'm confident it's going to work because I didn't just study the economy in school; I actually have lived in the economy for 25 years. [cheers and applause] And I've also had the chance during this campaign to go across America and meet entrepreneurs and innovators. And the spirit of America, the can-do, "we can make it happen" kind of spirit is very much there. And if we just have a government that recognizes that by lifting individuals and — and celebrating success in America, we're going to have more of it, then you're going to see this economy come roaring back.
What the president's doing is making government bigger and bigger and bigger. We don't need more government. It's crushing the American spirit. We need more entrepreneurs and innovators and more freedom for the American people. [cheers and applause]
I just have to tell you a couple of stories. I was — I had the chance to meet a woman entrepreneur. I've met a lot of them. And I met one, and I said to her, how did you get your business started? And she said, well, my husband lost his job and he took a class in upholstering. And she said that because she was the better business mind in the family, she started the company. And she hired him as her first employee. [laughter] And then she went on to hire 39 more people as upholsterers, and now she has a very successful, thriving upholstery company. That's the kind of entrepreneurship that drives America's economy. [cheers and applause]
I met a guy — I met a guy named Jim Leotoad. Jim Leotoad, southern Illinois. He graduated second in his high school class — second from the bottom, that is. [laughter] And he concluded that college was not likely to be part of his future. And so he went to his dad and said, can you loan me some money? And his dad and he worked out a deal. I think they split it about 50-50. Dad put up the money; he did the work and began his enterprise.
Well, he went out to buy a hamburger griddle and one of those rollers that makes hot dogs, you know, and then the big hood that takes out the smoke and all that. And by the time he added up the cost for all his, it was a lot more than the money he had.
He concluded the only thing he could make with the money he had was sandwiches because they don't take a lot of equipment. So he set up some tables in the garage and started making sandwiches, and then he delivered them to people at work. Now Jimmy John's has 1,500 restaurants and employs 60,000 Americans. [cheers and applause]
I just love the American entrepreneurship and innovativeness. It is what will rekindle our economy and put people back to work and cause wages and take-home to go up. We've seen it. We — and by the way —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We built it!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, you're absolutely right. We built it. All right. As someone over here said, we built it. [cheers and applause]
These entrepreneurs built it. When the president the other day said that in Roanoke, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe he actually said that, when he got up there and said if you have a business, you didn't build it, someone else did that. [boos]
And he said, well, you're — (boos continue) — he said you're taking me out of context. [laughter] The context is worse than the quote. [laughter] Have you seen — have you see the context? He said, you know, if you're successful, you may think it's because you're smart, but there are a lot of smart people, and you may think it's because you're hardworking, but there are a lot of hardworking people. I wondered, where he's going with this? You see — [laughter] — the America I know relishes and — and celebrates people who work hard to improve their — their minds and — and take risk and work hard and start businesses. That's what's going to get America going, not a bigger government. We want more entrepreneurship, not more government. [cheers and applause]
The president's making us more and more like Europe, and Europe doesn't work in Europe. [boos]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No!
MR. ROMNEY: It's not going to work here.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No! [boos]
MR. ROMNEY: I want to restore to America the principles that have made us the hope of the earth. When the — when the founders of this nation wrote the Declaration of Independence, they chose their words with care, and their vision for America was different than anything else that the world had seen.
First they said that our rights came not from government or the king but our rights came from God. [cheers and applause] That was the first observation. And then they said among those rights were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. You see, in this country, we would be free to pursue happiness as we choose. The government would not tell us how to live our lives or what kind of health care we could have or what kind of business we could be in or not be or what we could charge for a product we made. Instead we, as free people, would pursue happiness as we choose, and that innovation, that idea — that free people, each going in their own direction, not being guided by a government, but each going in their own direction — would create the most powerful economy in the history of the earth.
If we want to get America working again, we have to restore that principle. Those principles recognized the hand of God in the rights we have, recognized life, liberty and our right to pursue happiness. It's time for us to restore the freedoms in America to get America working again. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: This is important. This is important, you guys. This race is important. I agree with the president: This is a watershed race. This is a critical choice. Is America going to become more and more like the — the vision of President Obama with a bigger and bigger government?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: I agree with you. The consequence of taking the wrong choice here is severe because if we keep going down the path we're on, you're going to see chronic long-term unemployment, you're going to see no-wage growth — that's what we've seen over the last four years — you're going to see the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else become larger and larger. That's the path he's put us on. And you're also going to see fiscal crisis at the doorstep, like Europe is saying (sic).
There is a different path. The path I propose is going to get America working again. The path I propose will restore America's greatness so that we're strong abroad, we're strong here, America is coming back. [cheers and applause]
This is the day we've got to come together and lock arms. We've got to work together. I'm counting on you, Virginia. We have to win this. [cheers and applause] Find someone who voted for Barack Obama. Get them to join our team. We're going to take back America and make sure that we remain the hope of the earth. Thank you, guys. Great to be with you. Thank you. Let's win this one. (Sustained cheers, applause.)

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Painseville, Ohio

September 14, 2012

Ohio is committed, I'll tell you that. They're committed. [cheers and applause] I can't get over you guys standing out here in the rain. You are the best. Thank you so much. [cheers and applause]
I love Ohio. I love America. I love you guys. Thank you so much for welcoming me here today. [cheers]
Now, we come together in celebration as Americans and think about our future as a nation, but I also want you to know that in the last few moments, the bodies of four individuals who were killed in the service of our nation were brought back to the United States and welcomed home and placed in hearses. And one of the reasons that we delayed my coming out is I wanted to make sure and have my hand over my heart in recognition of these men and women.
Let me just remind you of their names. And you know the ambassador, Christopher Stevens, but there were three other individuals who were lost in that tragedy: Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods and Sean Smith. And I'd ask that you might each place your hand over your heart in recognition of the blood shed for freedom by them and by other — our other sons and daughters who've lost their lives in the cause of America and the cause of liberty, and if we'll take a moment of silence together. (Moment of silence observed.) Thank you so much.
Thank you for the memories of great men and women who love this country and who serve this country. And whether on a day like this, where the sky seems to be crying as well, or whether on a beautiful and sunny day, we remember those who serve and provide us with the liberty that we enjoy and the prosperity and the freedoms that are so much a part of the American experience. I love America. I love what we stand for. I'm proud of America. [cheers and applause]
I have to tell you that this experience today reminds me a bit of a time when I was serving as the governor of my state and I got a call from the airport that one of the servicemen of our state had been killed and his remains were coming back to Massachusetts, and they had called his parents to ask them to come to the airport to receive his body. But they lived so far away, they couldn't get there in time to receive his remains, and they asked if I could go in their stead.
And so I went to the airport. We drove out on the tarmac, and this U.S. Air jet came in and all the passengers got off the aircraft, and then all the luggage came down the conveyor, and then finally a casket appeared and was brought down the conveyor. And as it was, I — I put my hand over my heart, and the state troopers who were there with me, they all went to attention and saluted, and of course the members of the armed forces who were receiving the casket and putting it in the hearse, they also stood at attention and saluted.
And I happened to glance up at the terminal — the U.S. Air terminal there. There's a big glass window, a big wall there at the terminal, where it seems that the people who had gotten off the airplane, they saw all the police out there, wondered what was going on, so they were all lined up against the glass. And then all the people walking down the halls, they saw the people lined up against the glass, so they crowded in behind them to see what was going on.
And as I looked up there, every single person I saw had their hand over their heart. We're a patriotic nation. We love this country. [cheers and applause] We love the men and women who serve in this country. [cheers and applause]
Now, we face real challenges, and I want to talk about some of the challenges we face here in Ohio and at home right now. This is not exactly the way things are supposed to be. We were promised a recovery, and we haven't seen that recovery yet. [boos] When the president took office four years ago, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today 47 million people are on food stamps, 15 million more people. That's more than the population of Ohio have been added to the food stamp rolls.
We were supposed to be at 5.4 percent unemployment by now under the president's recovery plan, but instead we stay above 8 percent.
And by the way, that difference is not just a couple of percentage points. That difference is 9 million families, 9 million Americans that would have jobs if we had 8 — 5.4 percent unemployment rate. There are today 23 million Americans out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed.
This is a tough time. And even those people that have jobs, middle-income families are struggling, treading water at best, drowning at worst. You see right now that medium income in America has dropped by $4,300 a family, $4,300, even as the cost of health insurance has gone up, food's more expensive, utilities are more expensive, gasoline is doubled.
This recovery hasn't happened the way it was supposed to. And the reason we're going to get a new president in November is we're going to have a president who can get this economy going and put people back to work. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: I was — I was surprised that in the president's speech at the Democrat convention, he didn't talk about unemployment. I — I was surprised that he — he didn't lay out a plan to get America working again. Instead, he promoted that — that slogan of theirs, forward. I think forewarned is a better term, all right? [cheers] I mean, if you like what you've seen in the last four years, than you can vote for the same guy, and you're going to see more of it, because if you re-elect President Obama, you're going to see in this nation chronic unemployment, no growth in take-home pay and, of course, fiscal crisis at the doorstep. If you elect me, we're going to get 12 million new jobs and more take-home pay. [cheers and applause]
I've got a plan, all right? Unlike the president, I have a plan. And my plan will create 12 million new jobs.
Let me tell you what it is. I — I put my hand up because there are five parts to it. [laughter]
Number one, we're going to get this economy going because we have an ace in the hole we haven't taken advantage of. Some people discovered a number of years ago that you could drill not just vertically into the earth, but vertically and then horizontally. And by doing so — (scattered cheers) — they tapped into pockets of gas and oil. I'm going to make sure we take advantage of our oil, our gas, our coal — [cheers and applause] — our nuclear, our renewables. We're going to get North American energy independence. [cheers and applause] And that preserves jobs, and it creates jobs, not just in the — in the — in the energy sector, but in manufacturing, because when we have abundant and low-cost energy, manufacturing will come back here.
And you say, well, how are going to get North American energy independence? Well, one, I'm going to make sure we drill offshore. I'm going to double the number of permits we give on federal lands and in federal waters. And I'm also going to make sure we drill ANWR. But I'm going to get that pipeline in from Canada, too. [cheers and applause]
Number two — energy is one; number two: Trade is good for us. We can sell goods around the world and services and compete with anybody. We have the best workers, the most productive workforce in the world. So I want more trade. But I also want you to understand that when nations cheat, when they don't follow the — the rules of fair trade, we're going to call them on the carpet. China's been cheating; we're going to stop it and save and create more American jobs. [cheers and applause]
China — I mean, this sounds like the kind of stuff they — they talk about in classrooms right — right here at Lake Erie College. But let me tell you, the — the — when a nation holds down the value of their currency, what it does is makes their goods much cheaper than they would otherwise be. And China's currency is held down such that their products are priced well below what they'd be priced if their currency were floating on a market.
And as a result of that, their goods are cheaper, and people buy their products, and American companies selling those products go out of business. We can't let that go on year after year after year. It's killing our jobs. And then when they take our patents and our designs and our know-hows and — know-how and they counterfeit our goods, it kills jobs. This cannot go on. I will call China a currency manipulator and stop them in their tracks from killing American jobs. [cheers and applause]
Number three — number one is energy. Number two is trade. Number three is making sure that our workers have the skills they need for the jobs of today with the right kind of training programs. And we've got to fix our schools. Look, our kids can't have a great future unless our schools are competitive. It's time for us to put the kids — the kids and the parents and the teachers first and the teachers union behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four, you're not going to get entrepreneurs to go out and start a little enterprise, risk their life savings to start a business, you're not going to get big companies to expand in America unless they realize that we are not headed to Greece. And what you see in this country right now is the spending year-in and year-out, now a trillion dollars more than we take in every year. When the president was sworn in office, we had about a $10 trillion debt. Today we have 16 trillion (dollars). Think of that. All the presidents before him added up to 10 trillion (dollars). In one term he's gotten us to 16 trillion (dollars). There will not be a second term. We can't afford him for a second term. [cheers and applause]
And number five, to get this economy really going, we have to make sure that we focus on that part of our economy that really creates jobs, and that's small business. I will champion small business and entrepreneurs. [cheers and applause]
The president wants to raise taxes on small business. I want to bring them down. He puts more regulation on small business. I want to make less regulation on small business. And I want to take that big cloud off of small business. It's killing jobs. I want to get rid of "Obamacare" and replace it with something that'll truly reform health care. [cheers and applause]
This country is going to come roaring back. Let me tell you: You do those five things that we create those 12 million jobs, you're going to see rising take-home pay again. You're going to have young people that come out of colleges like this that can actually get jobs. Today half the kids coming out of college can't find work or college-level work. This is — this is not the American experience, the American dream they planned.
The majority of Americans today are convinced that the future is dimmer than the past. That's unacceptable. That's not America. That's not the America we know.
What's happening to us is we're becoming Europe as the president makes us more and more like Europe with bigger and bigger government. He doesn't understand that what makes America such an economic powerhouse is the innovative, creative, dynamic spirit of the American people. He thinks government does it. It's people that do it. I will restore this freedom of the American people and get our economy growing by doing it. [cheers and applause]
I was — I was — I was honored to be able to — to meet the people of America over the past two years and continue to do so, even today, get the chance to say hi to people and learn about their lives. A lot of people have told me how tough things are for them. A lot of folks can't get health insurance; it's too expensive. A lot of people can't afford the kind of life they used to have, can't go to the movies and can't go out to dinner. They just can't afford it anymore. A lot of people having hard times.
A lot of folks are ready to really begin to rebuild our economy. I — I meet entrepreneurs of all kinds. I met a woman who has her own business. And I said, how did you get into business? She said, well, my husband lost his job, and he took a class in upholstering.
And she said, because I was a better business mind in the family, I decided to start a company. And she did. And she hired him as her first employee. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) And — and then she went on to hire 39 more people. She says she has 40 people who would do upholstering work. And she has a leading upholstery company. That's kind of the entrepreneurship of how this country works.
And then — then I met a guy in southern Illinois named Jim Liautaud. I know (sic) whether you know Jim. Jim — Jim graduated second in his class, second from the bottom, in high school. [laughter] And — [chuckles] — and he — he had this idea that because college wasn't likely to be part of his future, he instead went to his dad and said, can I get a loan, because I want to start a — a little restaurant business, hamburgers, hot dogs and the like. His dad agreed. They were going to split the business 50-50. Then Jim went out and started finding out how much it costs to get a hamburger griddle and those rollers that heat up the hot dogs and the hood that takes out the smoke. And he — he found out it cost a lot more money than he had. About the only thing he could do with the money he had was make sandwiches. So he set up some tables and made sandwiches, and then he delivered them to people at work. And now Jimmy John's has 1,500 restaurants and employs 60,00 people, all right? [cheers and applause]
Now, that's — that's how America works. That — that's individuals that have dreams and that begin enterprises and employ one another of our fellow Americans. That — that's — and now we — that's — that's the model I believe in. That's the model I want to restore.
The president believes in having a government put money out into — into companies. He put $90 billion into solar and wind and green energy companies. [boos] He — he's picking winners and losers, or actually, in his case, picking losers, all right? [laughter] I mean, it's not just that they go bankrupt. He doesn't understand that the market, where free people pursuing dreams and working to take their ideas to the marketplace — that's what makes America go, not a government that tries to pick investments and — and — and guide the market for us.
Look, I believe in freedom. I believe in the American experience. I believe that when the — the founders of this nation, when they said that we had our rights, they said they did not come from the king or the government; they came from God, and among them — [cheers and applause] — and among them were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We're free in this nation to pursue happiness as we choose. And some extraordinary people have pursued happiness in such a way that they've invented products and started enterprises that employ us.
And the right course for America is not to crush them or denigrate them or divide America between those who've been highly successful and those that simply look on success with admiration and hope for themselves and their families. We don't want to divide America; we want to unite America, encourage success, encourage risk-taking, encourage new enterprise. And we'll put America to work. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: You guys, you are great. Let me tell you, I am so excited about our future. I have to tell you, I am convinced that if we do the things I described — and by the way, I didn't learn those things out of a schoolbook, all right, those five steps. I didn't learn those things talking about them at a meeting. Those are things I have lived by having worked in the private sector for 25 years. I understand how America works. [cheers and applause]
And I understand how important it is for America to be strong. I know what we have to do in terms of growing our — our principles and values, growing our economy and making sure our military is second to none. I will not cut American military. [cheers and applause]
I love this country. And you guys do too. I know that your — your being out here today, you're not doing this just because I have a great speech, all right. [laughter]
You're doing this because you care very deeply about the country.
And I'm just — I just want you to know I love this country too, and it's coming back. The work that you're going to do — I have one thing I want to ask of you. I want you to find one person who voted for Barack Obama — shouldn't be impossible — you know two, you know two already — find one or two of them and make sure they understand that if they want to have better jobs and more take-home pay and a more prosperous future for their kids, they need to get behind this campaign. Help bring people to the polls that will vote for the change in Washington that America deserves. [cheers and applause]
I'm — we're going to get — we're going to get there. We're going to take a step forward today, even in the rain. We're taking a step forward. We're going to show people we care enough to be out in this rain. We care enough to work hard. We care enough to knock on doors and make calls and get friend to support change, real change that will get America working again.
This is the day we're taking a step forward. I'm taking it with you. We're taking back America. We're coming back. We're going to be strong. [cheers and applause] We're going to help the American people have a bright future. Our kids are going to love what you do today.
Thank you so very much! Thank you! [cheers and applause]

Remarks via Video to the Family Research Council Values Voter Summit

September 14, 2012

Hello. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today, and I regret that commitments on the campaign trail prevent me from joining you in person.
Over the last year, we've had reminders that standing up for our values is not always easy but is critically important. I'd like to thank Tony Perkins and the Family Research Council for their leadership and for once again bringing all of us together to discuss vital issues that affect our country and our families.
This year the Values Voters Summit takes place at a critical moment. In less than two months, Americans will go to the polls and choose between two very different visions for our future. Over the past 15 months, I've met people from all across the country and from all walks of life. I've talked with them in ballrooms and break rooms and high school gymnasiums and on factory floors.
These Americans are good, honest and hardworking people. They're proud to cling to their religion and to the Constitution, the American dream and the principles our nation was founded on.
But today many of them are experiencing tough times. Millions of Americans can't find work. Too many have lost their jobs and their homes. Far too many are living in poverty, nearly one in six. And this administration has failed to make things better.
In fact, it's become even harder for our fellow citizens to get back on their feet and get back to work. Across the country, I've heard stories about the great strain that our troubled economy has placed on families. Moms and dads sit at the kitchen table each night trying to figure out how to pay a growing stack of bills. They're working harder than ever just to break even. They feel like they're standing still. They're tired of being tired.
It's not the best America can do. It's just the best the Obama administration can do. We can turn things around, and we can start this November by making a big change at the top.
We need a president who shares our commitment to conservative principles and our respect for traditional values. We will uphold the sanctity of life, not abandon or ignore it. And we will defend marriage, not try to redefine it.
We need a president who understands that we will not have a strong economy unless we have strong communities and strong families. This isn't conjecture or some quaint belief. It's evidenced by a Brookings Institution study that Senator Rick Santorum brought to my attention some time ago. For those who graduate from high school, get a full-time job and wait until they're 21 before they marry and then have their first child, the probability that they will be poor is 2 percent. But if those things are absent, the probability of becoming poor is 76 percent. In short, culture matters. And as president, I'll protect our culture and preserve the values of hard work, personal responsibility, family and faith.
Above all, we must preserve the American spirit of one nation under God. As president, I'll support the expression of religious faith in the public square. Our government should respect our values, not seek to silence them.
I'm proud to have Paul Ryan as my running mate. He'll speak with you during the summit about our shared commitment to these values and our common worldview. Paul and I will provide the kind of leadership that this moment demands. We'll work to strengthen our families, to rebuild our economy and to keep our military second to none in the world.
All we ask is that between now and November 6th, you join us and commit like never before. This election can come down to just one more vote. I ask you to find that one vote, ask one more person to join our campaign, ask one person who supported President Obama four years ago and didn't get the change they deserved. To join our cause, one more vote can make the difference in this election. And this election will make the difference for America.
Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.

Remarks to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 33rd Annual Convention in Los Angeles, California

September 17, 2012

Thanks.
Thank you so much, Hector, for that warm introduction and for all your help and support. And congratulations to Cristina as well. I'm —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [off microphone]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. Good to be home. I've got a son here somewhere. There he is. Here's a son over there. [scattered applause] And a grandson, too. Have you got your son there with you? Yeah, my son and grandson. Hi, guys. [applause]
It's an honor to be your guest and to speak to you as we begin National Hispanic Heritage Month.
I'm also pleased to represent the party of Governor Susana Martinez, Governor Brian Sandoval, Governor Luis Fortuno, Senator Marco Rubio and the Texas Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, Ted Cruz. [applause] These leaders are Republicans for the same reasons as millions of other Hispanics. They see that ours is the party of opportunity, the party that will restore America's prosperity.
Now, at our convention a few weeks ago, Governor Martinez described an experience that some of you may find familiar. At the beginning of her political career, she was a Democrat. And her star began to rise. And as it did so, she and her husband got an invitation to go to lunch with a couple Republicans. The words "Democrat" and "Republican" never came up. Instead, they talked about issues, not about party, such as how do we keep welfare from becoming a barrier to work, and how much government is needed before it becomes burdensome to families and small businesses. When the lunch was over, she turned to her husband and she said this: I'll be darned. We're Republicans. [laughter]
I love hearing stories like that. I'd like to hear more often. And I'm convinced that the Republican Party is the rightful home of Hispanic-Americans.
But my speech today isn't about my political party. It's about the country we love and the future we want to build.
During the course of the campaign, I've traveled across the country. I've seen people who've fallen into poverty, people who are living paycheck to paycheck, people who are tired of being tired.
Over 23 million Americans are out of work, underemployed or just have quit looking for jobs. The number of people on food stamps has risen by almost 15 million since President Obama took office. Median household income has fallen four years in a row.
Now, seeing such a poor jobs and income picture, the Federal Reserve has announced that it will once again print more money. The Fed knows that this comes with a high cost and risk for the future, but it feels it has no other choice. Our leaders in Washington have failed to produce a real recovery.
No one is exempt from the pain of this economy, of course, but the Hispanic community has been particularly hard-hit. While national unemployment is at 8.1 percent, Hispanic unemployment, as you know, is over 10 percent. Over 2 million more Hispanics are living in poverty today than the day President Obama took office. In 2008 candidate Obama promised us a world of limitless hope. What we got instead is a world where hope has painful limits, limits that make it harder to start a business, to grow a business or to find a job.
The administration promised us that its policies would have brought unemployment down to 5.4 percent by now. They haven't. Unemployment is still above 8 percent. And the difference between the 5.4 percent they promised and the 8 percent they delivered is 9 million more Americans not working, 9 million. I — I expected that the president, at his convention, would talk about the unemployed and unveil a jobs plan. Astonishingly, he didn't.
Now, I have a plan, and my plan for a stronger middle class will create 12 million jobs by the end of my first term, and it will raise take-home pay. My plan is premised on the conviction that it is freedom that drives our economy, that free people creating free enterprises is what creates good jobs with good wages. Government supports the job creators, but it cannot take their place.
Now, my plan, as you've heard, has five key steps. First, we'll take advantage of our oil, gas, coal, nuclear and renewables to achieve North American energy independence in eight years. That'll not only give us the affordable, reliable energy we need, it will also create nearly 4 million jobs, and it will bring manufacturing back to our country. [applause]
Second, we've got to give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today, and we've got to give our kids the education they need for the careers of tomorrow. There are too many of our kids trapped in failing schools. As president, I'll ensure that every child from every background receives a quality education. I'll empower the — [applause] — I'll empower the parents of our low- income and special needs students to choose where their child goes to school.
Now, three, we'll make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements with nations that play by the rules. At the same time, we'll crack down on nations that don't. We can jump-start our economy by expanding trade with Latin America, and our nation's 3 million Hispanic-owned businesses will have the most to gain. President Obama has not initiated a single new trade agreement with Latin America. I will.
I'll also pursue a comprehensive strategy to confront China's unfair trade practices, and I'll do that from day one. [applause] Now, the president may think that announcing new trade lawsuits less than two months before the election will distract from his record. But American businesses and workers struggling on an uneven playing field know better. If I'd known that all it took to get him to take action was to run an ad citing his inaction on China's cheating, I'd have run one a long time ago.
Fourth, we have got to cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget. [applause] I actually believe it's immoral for us to continue to spend more than we take in and to pass our debts on to our kids.
And I'd like to spend some time talking about this issue in particular. As businessmen and businesswomen, and as Hispanics, you understand the threat President Obama's spending poses in — for our future. Many Hispanics have sacrificed greatly to help build our country and our economy, and to leave for their children a brighter future. Today those sacrifices are being put at risk by a president who just can't stop spending. The president likes to claim he'll reduce the deficit by $4 trillion. What he doesn't go on to tell you is that he's including in that figure over 1 trillion of spending cuts that have already been put in place, or that he's counting deficit reduction for 12 years. Yeah, that's right. That includes five years after he leaves office, even if he were to be re- elected.
Under President Obama, federal spending peaked at 25 percent of the total economy. That's a level not seen since World War II. I propose to bring federal spending back to its historical levels, that around 20 percent of the economy, and cap it there. And I'll pursue a 5 percent cut in nonsecurity discretionary spending on my first day in office. It's time for a president who's committed to cutting spending and balancing the budget.
And I know how to do that. I've done it before. We balanced our budget in my business and at the Olympics and every year I was in my state. [applause]
I'm going to put the federal government on track to a balanced budget by eliminating programs — eliminating programs that are not absolutely essential and also cutting subsidies for things like Amtrak and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Legal Services Corporation and the National Endowment for the — endowments of the arts and humanities. I — I like some of those things, by the way, but we just can't afford them. In fact, my test for each program is this: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll cut it off. [applause]
Now in addition, I'm going to send a number of programs that have been growing uncontrollably fast back to the states, where I'm going to limit their rate of growth to the rate of inflation or, in the case of Medicaid, to inflation plus 1 percent.
And finally, I'll look to sharply increase the productivity of Washington by reducing federal government employment by 10 percent through attrition, by combining agencies and departments to reduce the overhead, by cracking down on the $115 billion a year in improper payments in government programs — [applause] — and I'll also align government compensation with that in the private sector. You do those things that I just described and we reduce federal spending by about $500 billion a year by the end of my first term.
The president, I'm convinced, has put us on a road to Greece. I'll put us back on a road to a stronger America, one which stops spending more than we take in. [applause]
And now number five — and you'll find this of particular interest — to get this economy creating the jobs we need and more take-home pay, we have to champion in this country small business. [applause]
Look, I started a business myself. We began with 10 people. Today it employ — employs hundreds of people. Our business was investing to help turn around or grow or to start up other small businesses. Today over a hundred thousand people work at companies that we helped start — companies like, as you heard just a moment ago from Hector, Staples, Bright Horizons, The Sports Authority, Steel Dynamics.
Small businesses often grow into large businesses. You probably know this. Two-thirds of American jobs created over the last 15 years were created by small business.
Now I know small business, not because I studied it in school, but because I lived small business. And I know that small businesses are being crushed by President Obama's policies. Too often government regulators treat businesses like to the enemy, and they crush them with an avalanche of regulations. Big business can deal with that. Small business can't.
And then there are taxes. I met an entrepreneur in the electronics industry in St. Louis. He said that he and his son had gone through a calculation to determine how much they paid to the government in federal income taxes, payroll taxes, state income taxes, gasoline taxes, sales taxes and real estate taxes.
It amounted to over half of what their business earned. Over half. Now, you think about that. The likelihood of success in small business is not real high, and if you're lucky enough to be successful, the government wants to take more than half. No wonder business start-ups are at a 30-year low.
But the president has announced that he plans to raise the federal income tax on small businesses even more, from 35 percent to 40 percent. That will kill about 700,000 jobs. We need more jobs, not less. And a recent study concluded that my plan, which reduces the tax rate on small business, will instead create 7 million jobs.
And now let me talk for a moment about "Obamacare" and how it affects jobs. The Chamber of Commerce surveyed 1,300 of its members. It found that three-quarters of them said they're less likely to hire people because of "Obamacare." Yeah, I know that we need health care reform, but "Obamacare" is the wrong way to go about it. "Obamacare" is going to replace consumer choice with government choice, and it would cause health insurance premiums to skyrocket. And it's already depressing job creation.
I'm going to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with reforms that increase choice, slow down the runaway growth of insurance costs and that open the doors to more new jobs. Now, by the way — [applause].
Let me note, if we do those five things, if we take advantage of our energy resources in full and we fix our schools and we open more trade and we cut the deficit and we truly champion small business, our economy is going to come roaring back. We can do better than this lackluster economy. We can create 12 million jobs and rising take- home pay again.
Now, my confidence, by the way, comes from the entrepreneurs I've met across the country. We're in a room full of hard-working entrepreneurs right here. Martha de la Torre is here. In 1988, Martha co-founded El Clasificado, a Spanish-language weekly. Classified ads; now, there's a tough business. But Martha adapted with the times. She became an expert in search-engine marketing, and she turned Clasificado.com into an online powerhouse.
We're joined by another successful entrepreneur, Dorene Dominguez. Dorene oversees one of the nation's top construction management firms. She's been collecting so many awards for leadership this year that we're lucky she didn't have a conflict on her calendar today. [laughter]
Now, I happen to believe that entrepreneurs like Martha and Dorene are the future for America. I believe in them. I believe the credit for their work goes to them, not to the government. And I sure don't believe that the government should take more of what they earn away from them.
This is really at the heart of the difference between President Obama and my vision for the future of America's economy. He wants government to tax more and regulate more because he believes government can do a better job than you can. I believe in you. I believe you could do a better job than government. I believe — [applause]. I'm confident that you and your dreams and your freedoms will build a stronger future for all of us and for our children. This belief in free people and free enterprises is the American heritage. It's why, by the way, America has outperformed economically every other nation on earth.
Now finally, I want to say a word about immigration. Americans may disagree about how to fix our immigration system, but I think we can all agree it's broken.
For years Republicans and Democrats seem to have been more interested in playing politics with immigration than with actually fixing it.
Candidate Obama said that one of his highest priorities would be to fix immigration in his first year in office. Despite his party having majorities in both houses of Congress, supermajorities, the president never even offered up a bill. Like so many issues confronting our nation, when it comes to immigration, politics have been put ahead of people for far too long.
I will work with Republicans and Democrats to permanently fix our immigration system. We'll never achieve a legal immigration system that's fair and efficient if we don't first get control of our borders. I believe we can all agree that what we need are fair and enforceable immigration laws that will stem the flow of illegal immigration while strengthening legal immigration.
I want to make this system far more simple and transparent. You shouldn't have to hire lawyers to find out how to legally immigrate into the United States. [applause]
And by the way, I want to shift our diversity visas to instead bring together immediate family members, and I want to structure our temporary worker visa programs so that these meet the needs of our employers. And by the way, if someone gets an advanced degree, I want them to stay here. So I'd staple a green card to their diploma. [applause]
America's a nation of immigrants, and immigration is essential to our economic growth and prosperity. One million immigrants legally enter America every year, the largest number of any country in the world.
I like that. I want to preserve our heritage of robust legal immigration. And I want to make sure that those who abide by the law and wait in line to immigrate here and do so legally are not at a disadvantage.
That's why I oppose amnesty because amnesty will make it harder, not easier, to strengthen our legal immigration system. It's also why my administration will establish an employment verification system so that every business can know whether the people it hires are legally eligible for employment. If a business cheats, there will be strict penalties for that business.
Now, in the midst of a difficult re-election campaign, President Obama created what he calls a "stopgap measure" — those are his words — for children who were brought here illegally, through no fault of their own.
Instead of playing politics with these children, I will pursue permanent immigration reform, and I'll start by ensuring that those who serve in our military have the opportunity to become legal permanent residents of the country they fought to defend. [applause] Those who have risked their lives in defense of America have earned the right to make their life in America.
Now, I've — [applause] — I've spoken often about how proud I am of my father. He was born to American parents who were living in Mexico. When he was five, they left everything behind and started over again in the United States.
My — my dad grew up poor, but he believed in a country where the circumstances of one's birth were not a barrier to achievement, a place where hard work could turn dreams into reality. He went from selling paint out of the trunk of his car to becoming the chief executive of a great car company and ultimately to become the governor of the state of Michigan.
My wife, Ann's father, was a first-generation immigrant.
He ended up founding a successful manufacturing company that made components and equipment for ships for the United States Navy.
I know that many of you in this room have similar stories. That's the American story. It's a story that is told over and over and over again. It's the story of the American dream. The American dream is not gone. It's just been put a little further from reach. I know what it takes to bring it back, to have it inspire our children just as it inspired our fathers and mothers. They sacrificed so much so that we might have it as part of our lives. And now it's our turn, our responsibility to restore the opportunity and prosperity and dreams that have invigorated this nation from its beginning. And it is a responsibility we will fulfill together.
Thank you so very much. [applause] An honor to be with you, and God bless you and the United States of America. Thank you. [applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Sarasota, Florida

September 20, 2012

Thank you! Thank you! Wow, you guys are fabulous! Thank you! Thank you! What a welcome! What a Sarasota welcome! Thank you! (Sustained cheers, applause.)
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Oh, thank you so much. What a welcome.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: It warms my heart, and I know you're warm. Thank you for braving the heat and joining me today. We're going to take back America, keep America strong. [cheers and applause]
Now, this is a critical election. You know that. This is a decision about the soul of America. That's why you're here. This is not about a person or a party; it's about America; it's about the country which is the hope of the earth. We're going to keep it strong and restore America's greatness. [cheers and applause]
Now, I know that the people of America have a choice. They can choose the current incumbent. He represents the status quo. If we re-elect Barack Obama, you know exactly what we're going to see. Outside — [booing] — outside there were some protesters. I love a few protesters, not too many but a few. [cheers] And — [chuckles] — and they had signs that said "four more years," chanting "four more years." I guess the question — if I'd had had a little time with them, I'd have said, do you really want four more years where only half of college graduates can get a job or a job consistent with a college degree? (Jeers.) Do you want four more years with 23 million people out of work or underemployed?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you want four more years where incomes go down every single year?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: You want four more years with gasoline prices doubling?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you want four more years with unemployment above 8 percent?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: That's why the American people are going to vote for real change in November, and we're going to take back this country and get it on track to greatness again. [cheers and applause]
Now, when it comes to the economy, the president has already thrown in the white flag of surrender. He said that with regards to his first four years, why, he gets an incomplete. And as you understand, when you get an incomplete, it means you have to take the course over again. And in this case, we're not going to let him take the course over again. We're going to get someone new to guide this country. [cheers and applause]
Now, the country faces major challenges. You know that we face massive debt, trillion-dollar deficits.
We face a Washington that's broken, that can't get the job done.
The president today threw in the white flag of surrender again. He said he can't change Washington from the inside; he can only change it from inside. Well, we're going to give him that chance in November. He's going outside. [cheers and applause]
I can change Washington. I will change Washington. We'll get the job done from the inside. Republicans and Democrats will come together. He can't do it. His slogan was yes, we can. His slogan now is no, I can't. This is time for a new president. [cheers and applause]
He went from the president of change to the president who can't get change. And the American people understand it. I couldn't believe it when I heard him today — or heard about it. I didn't actually hear it by his own voice, but I heard it from the reports that came out, and they said the president of the United States says he can't change Washington from the inside. Ain't that amazing? (Mild laughter.)
No wonder he's hard such a hard time over these last four years. His first two years, he had a Democrat House, Democrat Senate. He got to do whatever the heck he wanted to. But he says he can't change it from the inside. Well, I will. I'll get the job done. We'll change Washington. [cheers and applause] We'll restore the economic strength we need to put people back to work.
Now, there is something that he did put in place from the inside. And I hope people right here understand how bad news this thing is. He put in place something called "Obamacare." [boos] And there a couple of features of "Obamacare" I hope the people of Florida understand. One is he had to find some way to pay for it. The rules in Washington are such that if you add something that costs a lot more money, and "Obamacare" does, you got to find a way to pay for it. So he raised taxes by $500 billion.
But then this — I hope the people of Florida understand this — he cut Medicare by $716 billion.
[boos] And if I'm president of the United States, we're going to put that $716 billion back into Medicare — [cheers and applause] — back into the care of our seniors.
That $716 billion represents $1.4 billion in Sarasota County alone. Think of that. And what it means — the — the Medicare actuary and the Medicare trustees looked at what's going to happen by virtue of this $716 billion cut to Medicare. What they say it's going to do is that about 4 million people who have Medicare Advantage are going to lose it. And in addition, about 15 percent of America's hospitals and nursing homes will stop taking new Medicare patients.
What he has done to Medicare to pay for "Obamacare" is wrong. I will reverse it. I will save Medicare and protect for our seniors of today — [cheers and applause] — and our seniors of tomorrow.
And so with all the challenges we face in our economy, with all the chase — challenges we face around the world, the president came to give the address to the American people at his convention in Charlotte and — and — and I expected him to lay out a vision to describe his plan for getting America working again. Perhaps there'd have been two steps or five steps or some ideas. In fact, after his long speech was finished, there was no plan. He has no plan to make Washington work. He says he can't change it from the inside. He has no plan to get our economy working again.
Well, I have a plan. I have five steps that are going to get this economy going, create 12 million new jobs — [cheers and applause] — save Medicare and get our incomes rising again. [cheers and applause]
There are five things, and you've probably heard them by now. If you haven't, I want you to learn them.
Number one, to get his economy going in a big hurry, immediately, we're going to take advantage of our energy resources, our coal, our gas — [cheers and applause] — our nuclear, our renewables.
[cheers] We're going to rebuild America's energy economy. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: And secondly — and number two, to get this economy going, we believe in the USA. We believe in the ability of American men and women to compete. We're going to open up trade around the world, and we're going to crack down on China or any other nation in trade when they cheat. [cheers and applause]
Number three, we're going to give our workers the skills they need to succeed and make sure our kids are getting the education they need to succeed. For that to happen, it's time for us to put the kids first, the teachers up there with them, the parents, and put the teachers union behind. [cheers and applause]
You know, in a lot of respects, Florida is a model for the nation when it comes to education. Under Jeb Bush — what a terrific governor. [cheers and applause] Under — under Jeb Bush, you began grading your schools A through F so parents could see which — which schools were succeeding and failing. And then if a school was failing, the child was able to go from that school to a school of their choice. I will do that for the nation by saying all federal dollars in education are attached to the child, and those dollars can go with the child to the school of his parents' choice. [cheers and applause]
Number — number four — number four, we're not going to get entrepreneurs to risk their life savings to start a business or — or big companies to expand in America unless they know we're not on the road to Greece.
And we can't keep spending a trillion dollars more than we take in every year, or we'll be Greece at some point. I will not let that happen. [cheers and applause]
And so I'll finally cut spending. I'm going to cut spending. I'm going to cap spending as a percentage of the economy and get America on track to have a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
Look, I hope — I mean, this is a group of people that have balanced their checkbooks for a long time. I hope you understand that what's going on in Washington is not just bad economics, it's also immoral. I think it's — I think it's wrong for my generation to pass on trillion dollars of debt to the coming generation. I'll get America on track to a balanced budget and restore the kind of discipline we ought to have in Washington. [cheers and applause]
And number five — number five — if you want to see jobs really take off in this country, we're going to have to the number of — all five of these things. And the first one was energy. The second one was making sure that we have trade that works for us and cracking down on cheaters. The third was to make sure that we have the skills for our current workers and for young people they need to succeed. The fourth was to get us on track to a balanced budget. And number five is to champion small business. That's where jobs come from. [cheers and applause]
You know, I was with — I was with an entrepreneur in the electronics industry in St. Louis. He has four employees, small business. And he said that he and his son sat down and calculated how much tax they paid at the government and how much that is as a — as a percentage of their total profit as an enterprise. And he said they looked at their federal income tax and the federal payroll tax and the state income tax and the state sales tax and the real estate tax and the gasoline tax, and by the time they got finished adding up all their taxes, they realized that over half of everything they make is going to government.
Now, in a setting like that — [booing] — what I want to do is bring the tax rates down so small business is able to keep more of its money so it can hire more people. But the president — [cheers and applause] — the president's plan is for a million small businesses to raise taxes, to take it from 35 percent to 40 percent. That's the federal income tax. I will not let that happen because jobs is my priority. [cheers and applause]
And then you have all those Washington bureaucrats and regulators that think their job is to crush business. Look, a lot of you have had the chance of working in business. A lot of you work in businesses today. That's where your jobs come from. Time and time again the people across America tell me that they feel that their businesses are being crushed by government. The regulators are making it harder for them to carry out their enterprise.
I can tell you this: We have to catch the bad guys, but we also have to make sure regulators encourage the good guys. I will encourage small business, and I'll start off by telling small-business people, you did build it. [cheers and applause]
I think a lot of us were really surprised when the president in Roanoke a few weeks ago stood up and said, you know, if you have a business, you didn't build that; someone else did that. [boos] And I think the reason he said that was it laid the groundwork for his philosophy. His political philosophy is one of redistribution, the idea — [booing] — the idea being that the role of government is to take from some people and to give to others.
Now, I'm not talking about people in need, of course. We always care. Americans are big-hearted, compassionate people. We care for those in need. But the idea — [cheers and applause] — but the idea of redistribution, which is, we're going to take wealth from some and redistribute it to others, that's a foreign concept that's never been part of the American experience.
This is a land where economic freedom has allowed people to pursue their dreams, and in doing so and achieving success, they lift us a nation, they give us jobs. I will not apologize for success here, and I will never apologize for America abroad. (Cheers, applause, chanting.)
What you have today is a president who believes in cutting Medicare by $716 billion. What you have today is a president who believes in redistribution as a political and economic philosophy. What you have today is a president who says he can't fix Washington from the inside. It's time to get a president who understands what it takes to get America working again, and I do. [cheers and applause]
The question is whether America's going to become like Europe or, I joking say — [booing] — or like California. [boos]
Look, we don't want a government that gets larger and larger and larger, that takes more and more away from and borrows more and more from China and others, and passes those burdens on to the next generation. This is not the America that we know. That will not create the jobs and the rising incomes the American people deserve. I don't want to transform America into something we wouldn't recognize. I want to restore to America the principles that made America the hope of the earth. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We want you!
MR. ROMNEY: I was in — I was in Poland a few weeks ago, and I had the chance to meet one of the world's heroes, Lech Walesa. [cheers and applause] And I — I came in to — to see him, and he looked at me, and he said, you came across the ocean from America; you must be tired.
You sit. I'll talk. You listen. [laughter] And so I did.
And — and he began to speak. And he said this, he said, where is American leadership? America is the world's only superpower. We need American leadership. [cheers and applause] This essential for the world. It's essential for us. We need an America that's strong, with strong families and strong values. We need to restore our conviction that the founders were right when they said that our rights came from God, not from government. [cheers and applause]
We need to restore our commitment to life and to liberty and our recognition that the pursuit of happiness — that means individuals pursuing their dreams — that that pursuit is what drives our economy. Our economy is driven by freedom, not by government. Freedom must be restored to build a stronger economy. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: USA!
MR. ROMNEY: And so for an America to remain strong, it begins with that foundation of conviction in our principles, certainty that our cause is just. And then it moves on to making sure we have an economy second to none in the world, growing, putting people to work, welcoming people from around the world, coming here legally to take advantage of the American dream.
And then number three, not just strong homes and principles and a strong economy, but a military so strong no one would ever think of testing it. [cheers and applause] I love America's military. I love our men and women who serve in our military and who have served in our military. [cheers and applause]
One more thing this president has proposed, and that is that the combination of the sequester idea that came from the White House and — which is cutting our military by hundreds of billions of dollars in his own budget — [booing] — which cuts our military by hundreds of billions of dollars.
He would cut our military by a trillion dollars over this decade. I will not cut America's military. We must remain strong. [cheers and applause]
I want to recognize the men and women who serve or who have served in America's armed forces. Would you please raise your hand? [cheers and applause] Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. These are America's best. Thank you. We love you. We appreciate. You are heroes proved in liberating strife who more than self your country loved and mercy more than life.
We appreciate the strength of our military. I will keep America's military strong. I will get our economy to be the powerhouse it must be to make sure we can have a strong military. I will fight to preserve the values of freedom and opportunity that made America the nation that it is. And I can tell you this: I will change Washington, and I will do it from the inside when you elect me on November 6th. [cheers and applause]
Thank you so very much. Thank you. We've got work to do. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Las Vegas, Nevada

September 21, 2012

Thank you so much. [cheers and applause] Now that's a Las Vegas welcome. Thank you! [cheers and applause]
Boy, that warms the heart. Thank you so much. What an honor to be here with you and to have you welcome me like this. I know this is not just for me just for our party; this is for America. We're taking it back. [cheers and applause]
What an honor to be introduced by Colonel Anton . I appreciate his service in our military. I appreciate the men and women who serve in our military and have served in our military. [cheers and applause]
Today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day, a day that we remember those who've served our nation and not come home. We will keep them in our hearts and in our prayers forever.
We love them. We appreciate them. We want them to come home and be with their families and with a country that loves them and a country they love dearly. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
I am honored to be joined by your lieutenant governor, who is today governor because Governor Sandoval is over in China doing some work, getting customers to come here to Las Vegas. And so right over here is Governor Brian Krolicki, Governor Krolicki. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
And as you know, Congressman Heck would be here, but Congressman Heck is serving in the military. He's a member of the Reserves, and he can't be here because of his service. His wife, Lisa, is here somewhere. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Lisa. Right here. Thank you, Lisa.
And our — our hearts are also heavy as we recognize that Tyrone Woods, a hero who stood up to protect his fellows in Libya, lost his life, a Nevadan, a Las Vegan, who — who has lost his life. He left three children and a wife behind. May our hearts and prayers be turned to her and to their family as well. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Now we have some work to do. Yeah, sit down. Go ahead. That's right. [laughter]
You have some work to do, all right? Because you've got to make sure and elect me president in November. We're going to get that job done. [cheers and applause]
You see — you see, President — President Obama raised up the — the white flag of surrender again yesterday. He — [booing] — he said you can't change Washington from the inside; you have to do it from the outside.
We're going to give him that chance. He's going outside. [cheers and applause]
Last time around — last time around, his campaign slogan was "Yes, we can." I'm afraid it's changing now to, no, he can't. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) And we're going to take back the White House —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No, he can't! No, he can't!
MR. ROMNEY: Washington is broken. Washington is broken. There's so much we need Washington to do. We have 23 million people out of work. Incomes have been declining for four years in a row. Eight percent unemployment for over — how many, 43 months, right here in Las Vegas and in Nevada. You've seen housing prices bumping along the bottom, record numbers of foreclosures. These are tough times, yet we have a president who says he can't fix Washington. I can. I will lead; I'll get the job done. (Sustained cheers, applause.)
Now, I'm asked — [cheers] — I am asked from time to time, what am I going to do? How am I going to get these things done. And there are five things I'd do — and I want to repeat them for you, if you haven't heard them before.
Number one. To get this economy going and create 12 million jobs in the next four years — and by the way, when we create those 12 million jobs, we're going to see incomes go up again. Because even people — as you know — [cheers] — even people with jobs are having a hard time right now because the median income in America has dropped by $4,300 a family. And when median income's about 50,000 bucks, you think about the impact on all those families that are seeing $4,300 in less take-home pay. And then, of course, the gasoline prices have doubled. The cost of health insurance has gone way up. The cost of food is up. Cost of electricity is up.
These are tough time even — times even for the people who have a job. So it's hard for that have a job, hard for those that don't have a job.
So you ask me, what am I going to do to get those jobs and rising wages? Number one, I'm going to take advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas — [cheers and applause] — our nuclear and our renewables. And that means — and that means, by the way — it means doing the opposite of what the president did. He has cut in half the licensing and permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands, and as you know, there are a lot of federal lands in the West of America. Governor, what's the percentage of — the percentage in Nevada that is federal lands is 87 percent. All right? So I'm — I'm going to make sure that we double — not cut in half, we double the number of licenses and permits to drill for oil and gas on federal lands. [cheers and applause]
I'm going to make sure — I'm going to make sure our air and our water are clean, but I'm not going to let the EPA use its regulations to stop the mining and use of coal. [cheers and applause]
And I am going to bring that pipeline in from Canada, so we can get their oil. [cheers and applause]
So that's number one — energy.
Number two is trade. I want to make sure that we have more trade, with Latin America in particular. And if someone cheats, like China has been cheating, we're going to stop it. We're going to crack down on cheaters that are stealing our jobs. [cheers and applause]
Number three — number three, we need to make sure that our workers have the skills they need to succeed. And right now Washington — Washington thinks it knows better than the — the people of Nevada how to train people.
There are 40 — I think it's 47 different job training programs. And they report to eight different federal agencies. All that money, all that overhead — what I want to do is take those dollars, bundle it up, send it back to Nevada and say, you train your people for the jobs the people in Nevada need and want. [cheers and applause]
And to have — and to have the skills to succeed, we not only have to train our current workers, but also we have to make sure our kids are getting the education that will allow them to succeed. [cheers and applause] And — and we know how to do that. This is not a mystery. We can look at various nations around the world and see who's successful and who's not. We can look at our nation and see on average that our kids are scoring in the bottom quartile or bottom third in math and sciences. It's unacceptable.
I'm very proud that in my state, my predecessors there, both in the — the governor's office and the legislators worked hard, made changes to improve our schools. They're now ranked number one in the nation. This I know. [cheers and applause] If you want to have — if you want to have great schools, you have to put the kids and their parents and the teachers first, and the teachers' union behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four, number four, in order to create jobs, entrepreneurs have to be convinced, and businesses of all kinds that do the hiring have to be convinced, that we're not on the road to Greece, where we're not going to be in a setting where — where we have fiscal calamity. And so we have to make very certain that we do something politicians have talked about but politicians on both sides of the aisle have not done. And that is, I will cut federal spending, I will cap it, and we'll finally get on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
And number five, number five, to get this economy going, we have to champion small business.
We have to make it easier for entrepreneurs — [cheers and applause] — and small businesses. And that means — that means doing the opposite of what the president's proposed.
He's going to raise taxes on a million small businesses. I want to lower the taxes on all of the small businesses. [cheers and applause] I want to get — I want to get regulators who see their job as not just stopping the bad guys but also encouraging the good guys. And I also want to take this big cloud off of small business. I want to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with something that will get the costs under control. [cheers and applause]
Now, there are also some things we have to do to make housing work right here in Nevada. We have to reignite the housing economy here so that home values start going up again. It's just unacceptable. And there's some things I'll do. One, you all know the impact of having — having a vacant home on someone's block, all right, when having the garage door dented and perhaps graffiti or big weeds growing — that hurts the whole neighborhood. The federal government has about 200,000 foreclosed homes they're holding on it. I'll make sure we get them sold so every home is occupied and we fix our neighborhoods. [cheers and applause]
Now maybe — maybe some of you have tried to get a mortgage lately. And if you have, you'll find out how hard it is to get a mortgage lately. And I'll — I'll tell you why. It's kind of a confusing thing, but they passed this law called Dodd-Frank. And in there, they say — [booing] — in there they say that if you don't give out a qualified mortgage — it has to be a qualified mortgage or you could face very serious penalties. Now, the only problem is they didn't define what a qualified mortgage is.
So for two years, the people who were bankers and mortgage bankers want to give mortgages, but they don't know whether they're going to get in trouble because they don't know what the definition of a "qualified mortgage" is. And so we've had a hard time getting credit out to people who would want to buy a house. I will get credit flowing to people who are qualified so they can buy a home, and we can start moving more homes and raise values. [cheers and applause]
And you also — so you got to get credit to the home market if you're going to see home prices come up again. And the other thing you have to do is you have to have people who are able to buy a home — who have a job, who have an income. And that's why my plan to get 12 million new jobs in America and take-home pay is the ultimate way to get home values up. We're going to do it. Las Vegas is coming back. [cheers and applause]
And there's one more thing. There's one more thing that's going to help Las Vegas and get home values up and get unemployment down here. And that is, you're going to have a president that encourages people to come to Las Vegas for company meetings, not to stay home or go somewhere else. [cheers and applause]
You guys, this is important. What we're talking about is important. It's important to 23 million people that don't have a job. It's important to those folks that are coming out of college that wonder whether they can find a job. This last spring, half the kids out of — coming out of college couldn't find work, or college-level work. This is — this is the most prosperous nation in the history of the Earth. How can that be? We have got to fix this for ourselves, for the coming generation and for the world. It matters for America to be strong.
I was in Poland. I was in Poland a few in Poland a few — a few weeks ago, and got the chance to meet a world hero, Lech Walesa — [cheers and applause] — a — a man who stood up to the Soviet Union.
And I came in and he — he looked at me. He said, you — you must be tired. You sit. I talk. You listen. (Laughter, groans.)
And so I did. [laughter] And then he said one thing time and again over about 15 minutes. He said, where's America's leadership? We need America to lead. America's the only superpower on the planet. We need leadership.
We need leadership, American leadership, around the world. We need to have a military so strong, no one would ever think of testing America — [cheers and applause] —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: You see, I think the place only the president's comfortable cutting is our military. [boos] His — his White House proposed this sequestration idea that's taking hundreds of billions of dollars out of our military. His own budget takes out more hundreds of millions of dollars out of our military. I will not cut our military. The world is not safe. We must have a strong military — [cheers and applause] — and keep it so strong the world knows we're there.
We're coming back, you guys. The energy and passion of the American people is going to help reignite this economy and keep us strong and allow us to lead in a time when the world needs American leadership. I've been able to go during this campaign across the country and meet heroes. I see these — these men and women here that are wearing the — the uniform — [cheers and applause] — of our nation — a World War II veteran, a World War II veteran. [cheers and applause] Would you — would our veterans please raise their hand and be recognized?
Thank you. Vietnam veterans. Korean veterans. (Sustained applause.) I've seen the spirit, the patriotism of the men and women who serve, and we love and appreciate them.
I've — I've also seen the homes of America and how much we love our children and care for them and invest in their future. I've seen also the — the people who start businesses that employ themselves and one another. And — and I — I'm always amazed at the — the ways that people are can-do and how they start businesses and grow them.
And sometimes the — the innovativeness just — just inspires me. Why, Debbie Summers , right here in Las Vegas — you probably don't know Debbie — she's in the furniture rental business. You know her. She — furniture rental — she — [laughter] — she rents a — she rents furniture to conventions that come here and to nightclubs and so forth. I went to her warehouse. It — it looked to me like what she rents are black Naugahyde sofas and — and black coffee tables. And — and after President Obama said not to come here for company meetings, her business totally dived.
And — [booing] — and she was going to — she was going to lose her business, perhaps, and lose the jobs of people who worked there. But, you know, she's creative and innovative. And she said, you know what, instead of just renting furniture, I'm going to teach my employees how to make furniture. So she taught them how to make furniture. [cheers and applause] And now they sell furniture around the country, and they rent furniture here as well. That's the kind of spirit that you find in this country. It's amazing.
I met a Russian immigrant. And he — he came to — to San Diego. He had a back problem. And he — he was wondering how he was going to get that back — back problem solved. He talked to some doctors and so forth. They didn't have a great idea. He came up with a — an idea for how he could fuse a backbone in the best — in the best way and a new way to do the surgery.
And so he began a little company. Today that little company has $900 million in revenues, employs 1,300 people. It's called NuVasive. That's the nature of America, immigrants coming here, building our country. [cheers and applause]
And by the way, did you know that — did you know that the immigrant community, Latinos and other immigrants come here — they build new businesses more often than those that have been — those of us been all — been here all of our lives. We welcome people who come here and build enterprises and put Americans to work. And we want to help them. [cheers and applause] And he said it — he said it right there. He said, you know what, if you come here and you build a business, you did build that business. [cheers and applause] The government did not build that business. [cheers and applause]
This is — this is a time of choice for the country. This is a time when we could decide to go down the path President Obama's put us on. He's said he wants to poll our resources and re-allocate, all right. He's going to — he's going to — [booing] — take from some and give to others. This redistribution idea — this redistribution idea has been tried in other places. This is not a new idea. It's just never worked in other places and it's certainly not going to work here.
He wants a bigger and bigger government, trillion dollar deficits. What that leads to is not more people coming out of poverty; it's putting more people into poverty. [cheers and applause] Look, government is there and must be there for people who need help — for disabled, for the elderly that need help, for those that can't care for themselves. Of course, we will always be there. We're a compassionate people. But as someone has said, we don't measure compassion by how many people are on food stamps. We measure compassion by how many people can get off of food stamps and get a good job. [cheers and applause]
I'm convinced — I'm convinced that the path he's put us on is the path to Europe or, I jokingly say, to California, all right? [laughter] And I don't want to go there. That's not working there. I don't want to have it come here.
I don't want to have a government getting bigger and bigger, more intrusive, telling us what kind of health insurance we have to have. I don't want to have a government that becomes so large that it smothers the American dream. I don't want to have a government that takes from some and gives to others. What I want to do is restore the principles of freedom that made America's economy work in the first place. [cheers and applause]
I believe in the vision of the founders. I believe that when they said God gave us our rights, they were right. And among those rights are life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. [cheers and applause] We are not going to transform America into something we would not recognize. We will restore American greatness by restoring the principles of — of America. We will restore freedom, free opportunity for the American people to realize their dreams. That's what's going to bring us back.
I want to create those 12 million jobs. I want to help every citizen of this country have a bright and prosperous future. I want your children to know the future will be better than the past. We're going to make it happen. I need you to get me elected in November. Let's get the job done. Let's get America strong again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you so very much, Nevada. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Las Vegas. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Denver, Colorado

September 23, 2012

Thank you, Denver, Colorado. You guys are the best! What a welcome. Thank you! [applause] And thank you to Joe Dee for kicking things off for us tonight. And we have some special guests here tonight, as you know. I just want to go through a couple of names. You've got some congressmen here, Congressman Mike Coffman, Congressman Cory Gardner, Congressman Doug Lamborn, Congressman Scott Tipton and also some candidates for U.S. Congress, one from right here, of course, Joe Coors in the 7th district. [applause] And from the 7th district, Kevin Lundberg, and from the 1st district, Danny Stroud. And by the way, Bob Beauprez who got things started today, it's his birthday. Happy birthday, Bob. [applause]
And it's good to be here in the home of the Jaguars. Congratulations, you guys. [applause] What a beautiful place this is. Well, I'll tell you what, this is has been an interesting week. The president was being interviewed and I guess he said something a little unusual. He said, you know, you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside. We're going to give him that chance on November 6th. [applause]
And you know, now and then when I go to various rallies like this, there'll be a couple of people who will start chanting four more years, four more years. That's fine. They can express their First Amendment right. But I usually follow up with asking these questions. Do you want four more years of 8 percent or higher unemployment?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: DO you want four more years with 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you want four more years where every single year median incomes go down?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you want four more years where half the kids coming out of college can't find a college-level job?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Look, it's very clear. We can't afford four more years like the last four years. That's why we're going to get change finally in Washington, what the people of America deserve. [applause] Now, I happen to think that this election is going to be an election of a very clear choice of two very different paths for America. And on one hand, you have the president's choice which is a choice of status quo which is saying he's going to continue the policies of the last four years. He calls his campaign slogan "forward." And I think forewarned is a better selection.
And because what he's promising is the things he's done before. He's promising another stimulus. He wants to do that. He wants to pick winners and losers with investments in various businesses like he did last time. He's promised he's going to raise taxes. He's done that before. He wants to do that again. And so these promises he's made, we don't have to guess what the results will be. We've seen the results. We don't like the results. That's why that man needs to get out of that office and let someone get there who will take America on a different course. [applause]
You've heard what he's said before. And now, it's very clear. He's out of ideas and he's out of excuses and November, we'll get him out of office. So we've got that work to do. And this is the state to do it. I'm counting on Colorado. This could be the state that takes it over the edge. This is the state that could get us the electoral votes we need to win this. [applause]
Now, I take a very different path. His choice is status quo. My choice and the path I would take is bold new ideas to deal with an economy that's very different than what we've experienced before. My choice will lead us on a path that creates 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. And people say, how are you going to do that. Let me tell you — five key steps.
One, we have kind of an ace in the hold that came along to us because someone learned how to drill into the earth not just vertically but horizontally and so they can — and so they can tap into oil and gas and so we have extraordinary resources in both of those sources of energy. And so my plan is to make sure we take full advantage of oil, gas, coal, nuclear, renewables and get America — North American energy independence in eight years. [applause]
And we know how to do that. The president has cut in half the permit and licenses on federal land and federal waters. I will double those licenses and permits. I will — I'll make sure we drill in the outer continental shelf and drill in Alaska and I'll bring in that pipeline from Canada and keep that oil from going to China. [applause]
Number two — number two, we have to make sure that trade works for us and opening us new markets for trade in Latin America and around the world. It's a good thing for a nation like us that's highly productive. At the same time, we have to recognize that if there are nations that cheat on trade, we have to hold them accountable. China has cheated. I will stop them from cheating and stealing American jobs. [applause]
Number three — number three, we have to give our workers the skills they need for the jobs of today. But we also have to make sure that our young people get the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow and that means we cannot sit still with our schools performing nationwide in the bottom third or bottom quartile of world competition.
This is the nation that invented public education. We have to be the nation that lifts up the quality of our education. We know how to do it. We know what the key is. And the key is this. Put our kids and their parents and our teachers first and put the teachers' union behind. [applause]
So number one — number one is energy. Number two is making sure that we have trade that works for us. Number three is getting the skills we need to succeed. And number four, if we're going to get entrepreneurs to start up enterprise and put people to work or if we're going to have some big company decide to build a new factory and put more people to work, they're going to have to believe that we're not on the road to Greece.
But this president with trillion-dollar deficits has put us on that road. And if I'm president, what I will do is I'll cut federal spending, I'll cap federal spending as a percentage of the economy and I will finally get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause] And number five, I want to champion small business.
I want to make it — [applause]. I want to make it easier for people in small businesses to grow and expand and hire more people. This is a jobs plan. These five steps are designed to create more jobs and small businesses where two-thirds of the jobs were created over the last 15 years. And yet, the president has a different plan. He plans on raising taxes on a million small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: That'll kill jobs. He also has a massive regulatory burden that keeps on crushing a lot of our small businesses. And then he has a very special idea which is he wants to take away the rights of American workers to decide by secret ballot if they want a union or not. He wants these unions to be imposed on them. Look, my agenda is to do everything I can to help small business, to encourage small business, to allow it to grow and put more people to work. We do those things, we'll create 12 million jobs. [applause]
Now, I have to tell you I've seen American entrepreneurship and innovation at work as I've gone across America and had a chance to meet a number of you at events like this. I've had the experience of meeting some entrepreneurs and been very impressive. I find people — I was with a woman who said to me that she had her own business. I said, well, how'd you get started. She said, well, my husband lost his job and he took a class in upholstering. And she said, because I was the better business mind in the family, I started the company and hired him as my first employee.
And then she went on to hire 39 more people as upholsterers. And so she has the leading upholstery business. She saw an opportunity and she built an enterprise that employs people. I met another guy —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She built it!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, and she built it. She built it. That's exactly right. She built it. [applause] I met Sara Frye from Illinois, by the way, another woman entrepreneur. And she came to a big fundraising event of mine. I said, you know, how did you begin your business. She said, well, I began at age 16 selling pumpkins from the trunk — excuse me, from the back of my pickup truck. She now sells more pumpkins and melons than any other organization in the United States of America. It's absolutely amazing, entrepreneurs. She built it too, didn't she? Yeah, exactly right.
I'll mention — let me mention another one that I saw. Jim Liautaud — Jim is from Central Illinois. And he graduated second in his high school class — second from the bottom, that is. Don't take too many lessons from this, young people. But he graduated second from the bottom and he decided that college was not likely to be part of his future. So he went to his dad and said, can I get a loan from you and if I can we'll split the business 50/50. He wanted a food business of some kind.
And his dad agreed and then he went out and priced the equipment he wanted, the hamburger griddle, those rollers that heat up hot dogs and, you know, the exhaust fan and all that. And by the time he'd priced it out he realized he couldn't possibly pay for it with the money he had. So he concluded the only thing he could do with the kind of money he was able to borrow was to make sandwiches because sandwiches don't take a lot of equipment.
So he set up some stainless steel tables in the garage and made sandwiches and then delivered them to people at work. And now, Jimmy John's has 1,500 restaurants. [applause] And employs 60,000 people and, you're right, he built it. [applause]
If we do those five things, because I know the entrepreneurial, innovative spirit is still alive in America, you're going to see this country come roaring back. I understand what it is that made America's economy work from the very beginning. The Founders recognized something profound, inspired, wise. And that was that our rights came not from the king but our rights came from God Himself. [applause] And among those rights — and you know them — among those rights were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
We would be free that — you know, we trip off that last phrase sometimes without thinking about it very much. But we would be free in America to pursue happiness as we choose. We would not have a massive government taking more and more from us, telling us what kind of doctor we could have or what kind of insurance we must have. We would not have a government telling us that we had to join a union whether we wanted to vote for them or not. That's not what America was in their minds.
Instead, we should have individuals pursuing their own dreams. This is a nation of dreamers, dreamers who came here, dreamers who still come here from other places legally, those who are already here. We built this country. We built this economy. This is what America is. This is what will keep us strong. [applause] And sometimes — sometimes I think our president and the people with him just don't understand the power of these entrepreneurs, of these dreamers, of a free enterprise system.
They don't understand what it takes to get this economy going. They don't understand small business. I do, not because I studied it but because I lived it. You have to be in business to understand how to create jobs. [applause] Now, there's one more degree in which there's a dramatic choice between us and that relates to our role in the world. The president has a foreign policy that's been characterized as leading from behind. By the way, that's another word for being a follower.
And he has in place some plans for our military that are consistent with that kind of vision. His plan is to cut our military by about a trillion dollars over the next decade.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: And this is at a time when the world is not safer. The world continues to be a very dangerous place, as we learned time and time again. We have heavy hearts as we lost diplomats overseas in Libya. We have heavy hearts as we see our flag being torn and burned. This is a challenging time as we look around the world. So I believe we need to have a military that's so strong no one would ever think of testing it. [applause]
I do not want to be at the mercy of events. I want to make sure America can help shape events in the world. And for that to be the case, we're going to have to lead. I was lucky enough to be in Poland a few weeks ago and I met a world hero, one of my heroes — Lech Walesa. [applause] And what a guy. I mean, you think about that. It's almost hard to imagine. But the Soviet Union had come into his country, had executed some 20,000 leaders of the country. And despite that background, he as a factory worker, a shipyard worker at Gdansk shipyard, stood up and said no to the Soviet Union.
He said no and others joined him and he began a movement that changed Europe and changed the world. Extraordinary man — I came in to see him and he said, you've come from America. You must be tired. You sit, I'll talk, you listen. [applause] And so I did. And when Lech Walesa tells you to sit and listen, you do.
And so I sat down and he began to speak. And for about 15 minutes he said this time and time again: where is American leadership, the world needs American leadership. He said, America is the strongest nation, the only superpower on Earth. And he talked about a region and he talked about the Middle East or he'd talk about Iran or he'd talk about Asia.
And he said, where is American leadership. We need American leadership. I am committed to American leadership which includes — [applause] — which starts — that American leadership starts with strong principles and values and the conviction that our rights do come from the Creator and it continues with a strong economy, so strong that we can lift the American families and we can also build a military so strong we will recognize it as the greatest ally peace has ever known. I will keep America strong. We will lead. We will lead in favor of freedom. [applause]
Now, I have something — I have something I need you to do. I can commit to you that with every ounce of my energy, when I become president of the United States — when I become president of the United States — [applause] — I will get America strong in our homes, in our economy and in our military. And I need you to commit to do something. I need you to each find at least one person who voted for Barack Obama last time and convince — oh they're just fine. We need them to come vote for me this time.
So I want you to find them and talk to them and ask them whether they can vote in favor of someone who will bring real change and strengthen America again and bring back good jobs and rising incomes and I'll do it. I need your help to do it because this is the state that could decide it. And I want to tell you one more thing.
And that is I get the chance on occasion to tell a story or two. And I saw that film that you watched of me and my family and it began with some video of the Olympics in 2002.
And I wanted to share with you something I don't often do at a rally like this but you've been here a long time and this happens to be one of my favorite life experiences because it related to those Olympics. I had the occasion, as you know, to help organize the Olympic Winter Games in 2002. And at the closing ceremonies, Vice President Dick Cheney came. President Bush came for the opening, Vice President Cheney for the closing. And the vice president asked me to choose an American athlete to sit next to him to represent all the athletes that had performed in those games.
And so I chose Derrick Para. Derrick is Hispanic American, born in Los Angeles. And he's about 5'4. He was a roller-blader. His friends said to him, you know, if you ever want to get an Olympic medal, you're going to have to pick up another sport because they don't have roller-blading. And so, Derrick — Derrick went to one of the local arenas that had ice there, a skating club and went out and skated. And sure enough, Derrick was fast. And he worked like the dickens and went out and competed I presume against the big guys in Michigan and Minnesota and Montana — not Montana, they don't have as much, but maybe Montana, I don't know.
But all these guys of the big skating states, Wisconsin, and he beat them. And he became a member of the United States speed skating team. And so he came out to our games in Salt Lake City and skated his heart out and I believe it was in the 5,000 meters he got a silver medal and then in the 1,500 meters he got a gold medal — fastest man in the world on ice. So I said, Derrick, you come in and sit with the vice president and represent all our athletes.
And as he was coming in to the box, I stopped him and I said, Derrick, what was the most memorable experience for you in these Olympic Winter Games. And it wasn't the silver and it wasn't the gold. He said it was being honored to carry in the American flag that had flown above the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, into the opening ceremonies. He was one of eight athletes who was chosen by his peers to carry in this flag. It's about 8 feet by 12 feet and as you can imagine, it's badly torn and burned. So you can't put it up on a flagpole. You've got to carry it horizontally.
And he and these other athletes did. And he said, as we had the flag waiting to come into the stadium, the announcer said, ladies and gentlemen, the flag that flew above the World Trade Center on September the 11th is coming into the stadium. And he said he expected the audience to burst into cheers. But instead, total silence, complete reverence. And he said, so we began marching the flag in and they stopped in front of the choir.
And they began performing the national anthem. And he said, Mitt, it was hard to hold on to my emotions as they were singing those words as I was holding that flag. And then he said the choir did something I hadn't expected.
Now, I knew it was coming because as the guy in charge of the Olympics, I chose the version of the national anthem they sang. And I chose a version from the 1930s by Robert Shaw. And in this version, you repeat the last line as a reprise and the sopranos go up an octave and the orchestration is much greater — o say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And he said, this time, Mitt, as those words were sung a second time, a gust of wind blew in the flag and lifted it in our hands. And he said, for me, it was as if the spirits of all those that had fought and died for American liberty had just blown in that flag. And he said, so the tears began running down my face. And as he told me that story, tears filled my eyes. We're a patriotic people. We love this country. We recognize it is an exceptional nation. [applause]
This is a nation that needs a leader that will not just talk about unity but that will live unity, will bring our people together to help us overcome the challenges we have, to keep our homes strong and help our schools become the best in the world again, to make sure we have an economy that puts our people to work in the jobs they deserve and who will keep our military strong. I will do that with every ounce of my energy.
I need your help. We have got to stand together. We've got to work together. We're taking back America. We must keep this nation the hope of the Earth. Thank you so very much. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you! We've got to work to win this one! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Pueblo, Colorado

September 24, 2012

[in progress] — [cheers and applause] — number three — number three, I want to make sure our workers have the skills to succeed in the jobs of today, and I want to make sure that we finally fix our schools so that kids get the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow. [cheers and applause]
And look, we — we know what it takes to have great schools. This is not a mystery. We go around the world and we can look at school systems that are succeeding, we can look at those that are not. We can do so in our country. I'm proud of the fact that in my state the schools are ranked number one in the nation. How'd that happen?
Let me tell you how it happens. The key to great schools? Great teachers. That's where we have to put our focus, is helping get the best teachers and rewarding them for their excellence. And we do that, and you'll see our schools succeed. And for that to happen, we have to make sure we put our focus on the kids in school, their parents and the teachers, and put the teachers' union behind. [cheers and applause]
So, number one, energy. Number two, trade. Number three, great schools and training systems to help our people have the skills they need. Number four. Number four, you're not going to get entrepreneurs to risk their life savings to start a business, or big companies to build a new facility and start manufacturing products here if they think we're on the road to Greece. And this president's put us on the road to Greece. These trillion-dollar deficits, they lead to Greece or Italy or Spain. They lead to economic crisis. We can't go there.
And so in my first days in office, I will sit down and work to make sure we cut federal spending, we cap federal spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause] And I know how to do that. This is not a mystery to me. I've done that before. I did that in business, I did that at the Olympics, I did it in my state, and I'll do it in Washington. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
[cheers]
MR. ROMNEY: You know — you know, I think if you spend too many years in Washington, something sets in. You get used to this idea of spending money you don't have. It's kind of — kind of strange for families to even imagine how that happens or for people who are running little businesses — it's like, you run a business, if you keep spending more than you take in, you'll be out of business and out of work in a big hurry.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: That's right!
MR. ROMNEY: And — and the same thing in states and cities and communities and charities and all — everybody in America learns you can't spend more money than you take in, except Washington. And that's got to change because it's not just bad economics and bad policy, it is immoral for us to pass on these burdens to the next generation. And I'll stop it. [cheers and applause]
One more. One more. If we're going to get this economy turned around, we have to champion small business. We've got to make it easier for small business to grow and to thrive. [cheers and applause] I've seen small business across this country, and I've been inspired by it.
Tax policy relates to small business, by the way. I — I was in St. Louis, and I met a guy who is an electronics engineer. He has a small business, four employees. He said that he and his son sat down and calculated how much tax they pay to government, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, gasoline tax, real estate tax. They added it up. It was over 50 percent of what they were making.
And the president's plan, by the way, with federal income tax is to take the rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. That will kill jobs. I want to lower the rate so we can create more jobs in small business. [cheers and applause]
Our tax code is extraordinarily complicated.
I understand that there are about 7 times as many pages in our tax code as in the Bible, and it's a lot less interesting. [laughter] And so I want to simplify our tax code.
One way I'm going to do that, by the way — and this also helps jobs and middle-income families across America — I'm going to make sure we stop taxing — for anybody making $200,000 and less, we stop taxing interest, dividends and capital gains, let you save your money and not pay taxes on it. [cheers and applause]
We do those five things, and this economy's going to come roaring back. We're going to see more jobs. We're going to see more take-home pay. You're going to see your kids — when they graduate from high school or graduate from college, there are going to be jobs waiting for them. We're going to make sure — [cheers and applause] — all of you who are waiting — who are — who are living paycheck to paycheck, you'll finally be able to save a little bit, put a little aside. You'll be able to go to the movies again and go out to dinner.
Look, this is the way it's supposed to be in America. We can do better than this president. I will do better than this president has done for the American people. [cheers and applause]
This matters.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: This matters, you guys. This really matters. It matters not just for the 23 million that are searching for a better job. It matters also for these young people, as you know, that are wondering whether they're going to have a bright future. It matters for every mom and dad who are concerned that their child might not enjoy the kind of prosperity and peace that we've known. This matters for us.
It also matters for the world. I was in — in Poland a few weeks ago and met a — a world hero, Lech Walesa, a guy who — who stood down the Soviet Union, shipyard worker who said no to the Soviets and helped change the world. And I came in to meet with him.
He said, you've come from America; you must be tired. You sit; I talk; you listen. [laughter] So I sat, and he spoke and I listened. And he said this time and again. He said America is the only superpower in the world, and the world needs American leadership. Where is American leadership, he said; we need America's — America to lead; we need American leadership.
Look, the world looks at the events going on. They don't see these events as bumps in the road. These are lives. This is humanity. This is freedom. Freedom must be on the march. We must stand for freedom. I see these extraordinary aircraft here and know that behind them are men and women who've flown them in peace, in times of danger. They fly them to protect us. They fly to make sure the world is a safer place.
American leadership is derived from a strong military, which, by he way, is derived from a strong — a strong economy, which is derived from strong values and principles. I will strengthen America by restoring the principles that made it the hope of the earth! [cheers and applause]
The president's plan — the president's plan is based on a concept of government. He sees government as the source of America's strength. The other day he said — and you heard this, his now pretty infamous quote. He said, look, if you have a business, you didn't build it, someone else did that. [boos] And that wasn't a gaffe; that was his philosophy. It's this idea that government — that government is the source of our greatness. I don't believe that. I believe the founders were right. They said our rights came from God and they included life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. [cheers and applause]
In this nation, people pursuing their dreams, dreamers, that's what's built this country. People of all backgrounds who go out and say I'm going to do something and make ad difference for myself and my family, and then they end up helping lift the whole nation.
I met some dreamers over this campaign, a lot of them, met a woman who had her own business. I said, how'd you get into business? She said, well, my husband lost his job, and he — he took a class in upholstering. And she said, I decided, because I'm the better business mind in the family, that I'd start a company. So she did, and she hired him as her first employee. (Laughter, cheers.) And she's gone on to hire 39 more people as upholsterers. She has an upholstery business and employs people doing that. And I — and I salute that.
I met another woman, Sarah Fry — Sarah Fry . I spoke with her, and — and I said, how'd you start your business? She said, well, I really got going at age 16; I sold pumpkins from the back of my pickup truck. I said, what do you do now? And she said, well, as a matter of fact, I sell more pumpkins and melons than any other person in America. She has the largest melon business in America. [cheers and applause]
That's — I mean, this — this — I met another guy named Jim Liautaud, from central Illinois. Jim — Jim graduated from high school second in his class, second from the bottom. [laughter] And — and he concluded that college was not part of his future, so he — he talked to his dad and talked his dad out of some money for a loan. And they were going to start a business together with his dad's money and with — with his entrepreneurship. And it's going to be a food business, a — a restaurant kind of thing.
And he went out to get one of these hamburger griddles, you know, and — and — and the rollers that make hot dogs and the — the ventilation hoods. And it was a lot more money than he had. He concluded the only thing he could make with the money he had was sandwiches, because sandwiches don't take a lot of equipment. So he got some tables and set them up in a garage and made sandwiches and then delivered them to people at work. And now Jimmy — Jimmy John's restaurant has 1,500 restaurants and employs 60,000 Americans. [cheers and applause] That's what makes America go. We did build it. [cheers and applause]
I can commit to you this: I will do everything in my power to restore the principles that drive our economy and make us the hope of the earth. I'll do everything in my power to get our economy going again, so people could have good jobs and don't have to worry about living paycheck to paycheck.
And I will make sure we do not cut our military. I will keep our military so strong — [cheers and applause] — no one would ever think of testing it.
And now I need you — this is a big group here — I need you guys — [cheers] — I need you guys as well to make a commitment. If you're convinced that the last four years are not what we want for the next four years, if you're convinced that your young people deserve a good job when they get out of school, if — if you're convinced that we can see rising home values again, if you're convinced that we can do a lot better than these last four years, then I need you go and convince some of your friends who voted for Barack Obama to get on our team and to take a new direction in America. [cheers and applause]
This is our time. We've got to take this country back. We've got to put it on a new road to prosperity and to strength. I will do it. With your help, we're going to win Colorado. [cheers and applause] We're going to win Pueblo, big time. We're coming back. We're going to keep this nation the hope of the earth.
Thank you so very much. Great to be with you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks to the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City

September 25, 2012

Thank you, Mr. President. It's an honor to be there this morning, and I appreciate your kind words, and that introduction is very touching.
If there's one thing we've learned this election season, by the way, it is that a few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good. [laughter and applause]
All I got to do now is wait a couple of days for that bounce to happen, so — [laughter] —
As you know, since — since serving as president, President Clinton has devoted himself to — to lifting people around the world. And one of the best things that can happen to any cause, to any people, is to have Bill Clinton as its advocate. And — and that's — that's really true for a whole series of causes, but particularly for the needy and neglected causes. If — if he gets behind them, it makes a real difference. And it's that kind of work that brings us here together today, and I appreciate your willingness to spend time and to listen to those that are coming with their messages.
Now, there are a number of things that impress me about the Global Initiative. And one of them is that, as I've seen it from afar, I've been impressed by the extraordinary power that you have derived by harnessing together people of different backgrounds, institutions of different backgrounds and persuasions. Your — you've able to fashion partnerships, if you will, across the traditional boundaries — public and private, for-profit, not-for-profit, charitable, commercial.
At a smaller scale, by the way, I — I've seen the power of partnerships like this work before. In — in Massachusetts, Bill Clinton just spoke about — about City Year. And I have right over here Michael Brown, one of the founders. This was — this was an effort where two social pioneers, Michael and his friend Alan Khazei, brought corporations and government together with volunteers to form this entity. And it was the model, as the president said, for AmeriCorps. And — and I — I actually happened to be there at the first time he visited City Year. He was there investigating the life- changing successes, which were being reported by — in — in the lives of these young people who had come together for a year of service and as they were linked with corporate teams that worked with them.
Now, I also saw the power of these kind of partnerships in — in 2002 when I was asked to be the head of the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
I saw what could happen when very disparate elements of a community were willing to join together in extraordinary unity, and we were able to overcome challenges that many thought would be impossible for an organization like ours to — to overcome.
Now, the Clinton Global Initiative has also demonstrated the effectiveness of entrepreneurship and social enterprise. You endeavor not only to comfort and assuage the pains of the — the afflicted but also to change lives, to change lives through freedom, through — through free enterprise, through entrepreneurship and — and through the incomparable dignity that is associated with work. Free enterprise, as we know, has done more to bless humanity than any other economic system not only because it's the only system that creates a prosperous middle class but also because it's the only system where the individual enjoys the freedom to guide and build his or her life. Free enterprise can not only make us better off financially, it can make us better people.
Ours is a very compassionate nation, as you know. We look around the world, and we see withering suffering. Our hearts break. Though we make up only 4.5 percent of the world's population, we donate nearly a quarter of all global foreign aid, more than twice as much as any other nation on earth. And Americans give more than money. Pastors like Rick Warren lead mission trips that send thousands of Americans around the world, bringing aid and comfort to the poorest places on the planet. American troops are the first on the scene of a natural disaster. An earthquake strikes, Haiti in — in Haiti, and care packages come from all over the world, but they come first from America. And not far behind, of course, are Presidents Clinton and Bush.
But too often our passion for charity as a people is tempered by our sense that our aid is not always effective.
We see stories of cases where American aid has been diverted to corrupt governments. We sometimes wonder why year after year after year of aid and relief seem to never extinguish the suffering and hardship, why it persists decade after decade.
Perhaps some of the disappointments are due to our failure to recognize just how much the developing world has changed. A lot of the foreign aid efforts that we put in place some years ago were designed at a time when government development assistance accounted for about 70 percent of the resources flowing to developing nations. Today 82 percent of the resources that flow to developing nations come from the private sector, not the governmental sector. If somehow foreign aid can really leverage that massive investment by the private sector, it may be able to exponentially expand the ability to not only care for those that are suffering but also to change their lives on a permanent basis.
Now, private enterprise is — is having a greater and greater impact, actually, on its own in the developing world. As an example, the John Deere company embarked upon a pilot project in Africa where it developed a suite of farm tools that could be attached to a very small tractor, and then the company worked to expand the availability of capital to the farmers there so they could maintain and develop their own businesses. The result has been a good investment for John Deere and a greater opportunity for African farmers who are now able to grow more crops and provide for more plentiful lives of their own.
For American foreign aid to become more effective, it's got to embrace the principles that you see in these global initiatives: the power of partnerships, access to the transformative nature of free enterprise and the leverage of the abundant resources that can come from the private sector.
Now I believe that there are three quite legitimate objects of our foreign aid in this country.
First, of course, is to address humanitarian needs. Such is the case with the PEPFAR, which has given medical treatment to millions suffering from HIV and AIDS.
Second is to foster a substantial United States strategic interest. Perhaps it's military or diplomatic or — or economic.
But third, there's another purpose, and one that I think has to receive much more attention and a much higher priority in a Romney administration. And that is aid that elevates people and brings about lasting change in communities and nations.
As an example, a lot of Americans, including myself, are developed — excuse me — are troubled by developments in the Middle East. Syria has witnessed the killing of tens of thousands of people. The president of Egypt is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Our ambassador to Libya was assassinated in a terrorist attack. Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons capability. We somehow feel that we're at the mercy of events, rather than shaping events.
I'm often asked why, what can we do it — do about it to — to have — lead the Middle East to stability and to ease the suffering and the anger and the — and the hate there and the violence.
Obviously religious extremism is certainly part of the problem, but that's not the whole story.
The population of the Middle East is very young, as you know, particularly in comparison with the population of the developed nations. And typically, the — these young people, as the president indicated a moment ago, don't have a lot of job prospects. The levels of youth unemployment across the region are excessive and chronic. And in nations that have undergone a change in leadership recently, young people have greater access to information.
In the past, that was being carefully guarded by tyrants and dictators, but now it's available. They see the good as well as the bad in surrounding societies. They can now organize across vast regions, mobilizing populations. Idle, humiliated by poverty and crushed by government corruption, their frustration and their anger grows.
In such a setting, for America to actually change lives, to change communities and nations in the Middle East, foreign aid must also play a role. And the shape that role should play was brought into focus by the life and death of Mohamed Bouazizi of Tunisia, that street vendor who self-immolated and who sparked, thereby, the Arab Spring.
You probably know this background, but it touched me. He was just 26 years old. He had provided for his family since he was a very young boy. He worked a small fruit stand, selling to passers-by. The regular harassment by corrupt bureaucrats was elevated one day when they came in and took cases of his fruit, and then they took away his weighing scales, his only real capital equipment, away from him.
On the day of his final protest, witnesses say that an officer slapped him and he cried out with these words: Why are you doing this to me? I'm a simple person. I just want to work. I just want to work.
Work. That has to be at the heart of our effort to help people build economies that can create jobs, young and old alike. Work builds self-esteem. It transforms minds from fantasy and fanaticism to reality and grounding. Work does not long tolerate corruption, nor will it quietly endure the brazen theft by government of the product of hard-working men and women.
To foster work and enterprise in the Middle East and in other developing countries, I'll initiate something I'll call "Prosperity Pacts." Working with the private sector, the program will identify the barriers to investment and trade and entrepreneurship and entrepreneurialism in developing nations. And in exchange for removing those barriers and opening their markets to U.S. investment and trade, developing nations will receive U.S. assistance packages focused on developing the institutions of liberty, the rule of law, and property rights.
We'll focus our efforts on small- and medium-size businesses. Microfinance has been an effective tool at promoting enterprise and prosperity, but we — we got to expand to small- and medium-size businesses as well that are oftentimes too large for microfinance and too small for traditional banking.
The aim of a much larger share of our aid must be the promotion of work and the fostering of free enterprise. Nothing we can do as a nation will change lives and nations more effectively and permanently than sharing the insight that lies at the foundation of America's own economy, and that is that free people pursuing happiness in their own ways build a strong and prosperous nation.
Now, when I was in business, I traveled to a number of other countries. I was often struck by the vast difference in wealth among nations that were sometimes neighbors. Some of that was of course due to geography. Rich countries often had natural resources like mineral deposits or access to waterways for transportation. But in some cases, all that seemed to separate a rich country from a more poor one was a faint line on a map. Countries that were physically right next door to each other were in some cases economically worlds apart.
You can think of North Korea and South Korea. I became convinced that the critical difference between these countries wasn't geography. I noticed that the most successful countries shared something in common. They were the freest. They protected the rights of individuals. They enforced the rule of law. They encouraged trade and enterprise. They understood that economic freedom is the only force in history that has consistently lifted people out of poverty and kept people out of poverty.
Look, a temporary aid package can — can give an economy a — a boost. It can fund projects. It can pay some bills. It can employ some people for a time. But it can't sustain an economy, not for the long term. It can't pull the whole cart, if you will, because at some point the money runs out. But — but an assistance program that helps unleash free enterprise can create enduring prosperity. Free enterprise is based on mutual exchange, or rather millions of exchanges, millions of people buying, trading, selling, building, investing. Yeah, it has its ups and downs. It isn't perfect. It's more reliable, however, and more durable. And ultimately, as history has shown, it's — it's more successful.
By the way, perhaps the best example of — of the good that free enterprise can do is by looking at the example of the developed world itself. My friend Arthur Brooks at the American Enterprise Institute — he's pointed out that before the year 1800, living standards in the West were appalling. A person born in the 18th century lived essentially as his great-great-great-grandfather had. Life was overwhelmed with disease and danger and early death. But starting in 1800, the West began two centuries of free enterprise and trade.
Living standards rose. Literacy spread. Health improved. In our own country, between 1820 and 1998 real per capita GDP, real per capital GDP increased twenty-twofold.
As the most prosperous nation in history, it's our duty to keep the engine of prosperity running, to open markets across the globe and to spread prosperity to all the corners of the earth. We should do it because it's the right moral course to help others of our brothers and sisters.
But it's also economically the smart thing for us to do. In our export industries, the typical job pays above what the comparable workers make in other industries, and more than one-third of manufacturing jobs in this country are tied to exports. Sadly, we've lost over half a million manufacturing jobs over the last four years.
As president, I intend to reverse that trend by ensuring we have trade that works for America. I want to negotiate new trade agreements and ask Congress to reinstate Trade Promotion Authority. I want to complete negotiations to expand the Trans-Pacific Partnership and create what I call a "Reagan Economic Zone," where any nation willing to play by the rules of free and fair trade can participate in a new community committed to fair and free trade.
I've laid out a new approach for a new era. We're going to couple aid with trade and private investment and partnerships to empower individuals, encourage innovators and reward entrepreneurs.
Today we face a world with unprecedented challenges and complexities. We should not forget and cannot forget that not far from here, a voice of unspeakable evil and hatred has spoken out, threatening Israel and the entire civilized world. But we come together knowing that the bitterness of hate is no match for the strength of love.
In the weeks ahead I will continue to speak to these challenges and the opportunities that this moment presents us. I'll go beyond foreign assistance and describe also what I believe America's strategy should be to secure our interests and ideals during this uncertain time.
A year from now I hope to return to this meeting as president, having made substantial progress towards achieving the reforms I've outlined. But I also hope to remind the world of the goodness and the bigness of the American heart. I'll never apologize for America. I believe that America has been one of the greatest forces for good the world has ever known. We can hold that knowledge in our hearts with humility and unwavering conviction.
God bless you and this great work, and God bless my country and yours. Thank you so very much. It's an honor to be with you. [applause]

Remarks at the NBC Education Nation Summit in New York City

September 25, 2012

Thank you. It's an honor to be here with you and I appreciate the chance that NBC is giving us to come together to talk about a topic as important the education of our children, and also enjoy the chance to see Brian Williams, a — an American hero, a real champion, a man of character and integrity. And it's — it's an honor to be here with him as well.
Let me take you back to my own experience and — and I — I'm thinking of my children, my five sons, and the experience that I had in watching their education and participating in it. I was lucky to live in the state of Massachusetts because our state has and had at the time very good schools.
As a matter of fact, I was pleased that while was I serving as governor, the NAEP exam, which, as you know, tests our kids every two years — fourth graders, eighth graders — in English and math — the results came back. Our fourth graders came out number one in the nation in English and also number one in math, and our eighth graders came out number one in English and number one in math. So in all four of the federal measures that evaluate the effectiveness of schools, our kids were number one. Had never happened before.
And I looked back to understand why our school as had become so successful, and I think it goes back to 1993, when my predecessors, Governor Weld and the leaders of the Democratic house and senate, came together to reform education. And they made a number of changes that I think are what helped drive our schools to be so successful.
One, they said, that to graduate from high school, a student was going to have to pass a graduation exam in English and math. And while I was governor, by the way, I added science to that as well. So a graduation exam.
Two, they worked on a — a statewide curriculum. It took a number of years to put that together, but they had a series of elements they felt that students needed to learn.
Three, they would evaluate annually the success of various schools — all the schools, actually. And if a school consistently fell below a passing grade, then the state had the capacity to step in, take over the school, remove its leadership and actually remove elements of the union contract if they believed those elements interfered with the education of a child.
Beyond that, I had the chance not just to have this — if you will, the stick — if you can't pass the graduation exam, you can't graduate; I always worked to put in place the carrot, if you will — an incentive. While I was governor, we were able to pass legislation that said that if you took the exam to graduate and you were among the top quarter in your high school in terms of the grades you got in that exam, then you were entitled to the John and Abigail Adams scholarship, which was four years tuition-free at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. Now, that's not as generous as you might hope, because in Massachusetts, fees are a lot more than tuition. But it was nonetheless some help and support for young people who were working to get into higher education.
We also in that 1993 legislation opened the door to far more choice by offering a massive expansion in charter schools. That went along with our Catholic schools, which had long offered extensive choice in Massachusetts.
And perhaps the most important single thing I think from the education reform effort that went on was an increased focus on the teachers, on hiring the very best and brightest we possibly could, promoting them and giving them opportunities to be successful in the classroom.
Now, my experience there was — was consistent with something I read as I was serving as governor, because I wanted to find ways to keep our schools as good, at least, as what I — how I found them. And — and I read some work that was done by a group called the McKinsey Institute. McKinsey's a major international consulting firm, but they have a not-for-profit foundation which does research around the world. And they looked at school systems all over the world, compared nations, which ones were successful — Finland, as I recall, Singapore, Korea — South Korea — as well as places within the United States that were successful. And they looked at the Boston school system, for instance, and looked at all the differences between school districts and systems.
And they came to this conclusion. They said first of all, within a normal band of population, that the classroom size didn't seem to be driving the quality of education; that obviously, at some extreme, that would figure into it, be a major impact, but within the normal range that exists in schools, it wasn't classroom size that was driving it. Nor was it spending per student. They were surprised by both those things as they looked around the world.
Their conclusion was that overwhelmingly the greatest determination --or determiner of the success of a school system was the quality of the teachers in the system, and that the very best nations and districts in terms of education were those that found a way to attract the best and brightest to come into education. They pointed out, as I recall, that in Finland, I think it was, that the teachers were drawn from the top 5 or 10 percent of college graduates. And they pointed out that too often in our country, we're not drawing from the very top.
And they tried to understand why that was and pointed out that in other nations, that drew from the very top, they had better starting salaries for teachers, and they promoted teachers based on their capacity and their skill, the ability they had to change lives in classrooms, as opposed to their tenure alone.
They looked at our schools and felt that we were too — too focused on pensions and post-retirement benefits and tenure, and not sufficiently focused on starting salaries and helping people get going in their life. If they got a lot of student loans, they need those starting salaries to get going and also a system which promotes teachers based upon their success in the classroom.
I look at the federal level and understand that as — if I'm the next president of the United States, as I hope to be, that I — I don't want to step in and try and run schools for local school districts or for states. Education is largely run at the state level. But I — I do believe that there is action I can take at the federal level that will have an impact on improving the quality of education, and it flows from my experience both as governor and from the experience of — of those that have studied education, such as the McKinsey Institute.
And the proposals that I have are — are these. First of all, I would take IDEA and Title I money — and as you know, those are the federal funds that go to follow both special needs kids and low-income kids, and that's about half the kids in America — receive federal funding from those two sources, one or the other of those two sources — I would link that money not to the school districts or to the state but to the students and say to the student, you can take that money to the school of your choice. So you and your parents can decide what school you want to go to. And that of course will drive a very different level of school choice than we have today.
To help the parents make the choice of which school to send their child to, I would insist that schools are graded on a simple basis that parents could understand, A through F, the way Florida's done. Florida's actually done quite a job in saying, how we can we evaluate the success of schools and then give to — to students the opportunity to make the choice of which they'd like to go to. I — I'm impressed with — I mean, you know some of the statistics from — from Florida.
Some have said, well, it's going to be hard for Hispanic students to — to be able to keep up with the rest of the population.
Not so. In Florida, by virtue of those two changes, if you had a state that was just comprised of the Hispanic students of Florida, why, that state would fall right in the middle, about rank number 25 of American states. And that's been in part because of these extraordinary improvements that have been brought into the — to the — to the school system in — in Florida.
So those are two things I would do at the federal level — give students more choice, allow parents to have access to information about the quality of the schools.
And I'd also like to make sure that we create incentives for school districts and for states to offer more choice in schools, to take away the barriers to charter schools, to take away the barriers to cyberlearning, to allow students to choose public schools, public charter schools where it's allowed by law, private schools or cyberlearning or even tutorial-type sessions. I want to provide incentive at the federal level to encourage states to encourage new choice and new information for our parents.
Let me just make a comment about higher education, as well. Higher education is also essential to the success of our economy and to the well-being of so many of our fellow citizens. And we have excellent institutions of higher learning. I mean, it's — we're a model for the world. But one trend in higher education gives me great concern, and that's the rapid growth in the cost of tuition, the cost of higher education.
And we're on an unsustainable path there. You can't continue to have higher-education tuition grow at a multiple of the rate of inflation. At some point, something has to give. And we're going to have to find a solution to that challenge. I have ideas myself in that regard, but I do believe that this is something that just — just can't go on.
And related to that is the fact that people coming out of institutions of higher learning can't find jobs. And the combination of more and more expensive tuition and fewer and fewer job opportunities, this last year with half of our kids graduating without being able to have a full-time job or one consistent with their degree, that's a real problem.
And — and those two combined must end, or we're going to have a real threat to our higher education system.
So I — I applaud the chance to be able to speak with you today, your willingness to be here. I am — I'm absolutely convinced that enough — for us to maintain our leadership of the world economically, morally, militarily, diplomatically, that America must have the best schools in the world. And today with our kids performing in the bottom third or bottom quartile in science and math, that's simply not the case. And I think we know the answer as to what it takes to fix our schools is to invest in great teachers. Teachers are the answer. Thank you. [applause]
MODERATOR: Yeah, I think — there, you already have one. And a little bit of a luxury, I've asked for water for both of us. [laughter]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you.
MODERATOR: Again, thank you for appearing here at our forum. Let's begin with a story that was just in the news a few days ago from the city of Chicago and something very basic about education and labor. In your view, should teachers be allowed to strike?
MR. ROMNEY: I don't know that I would prevent teachers from being able to strike. I just think the most important aspect in — in being able to have a — a productive relationship between the — the teachers' unions and the — and the — and the districts and the states that they're dealing with is that the person sitting across the table from them should not have received the largest campaign contributions from the teachers' union itself.
We have a very unusual system in this country, and it's not just related to teachers' union, it relates more broadly, but — but people are able to give. And in the case of the Democratic Party — I don't mean to be terribly partisan, but I kind of am — [chuckles] — [laughter] — in — in case of the Democratic Party, the largest contributors to the Democratic Party are the teachers' unions, the federal teachers' unions.
And so if they could elect someone, then that person is supposed to be representing the public vis-a-vis the teachers union, but actually, most of their money came from the teachers union. It's an extraordinary conflict of interest. That's something I think is a problem and should be addressed.
But allowing teachers to strike on — on matters such as their compensation, I think, is a — is a right that exists in this country. But I do believe we have to have a — a — a — a recognition that the person sitting across the table is representing the public and the students, not the teachers union.
MODERATOR: Another issue that came out of Chicago, Governor, in your view, what percentage of a teacher's salary should be determined by test scores?
MR. ROMNEY: I don't know that there's a — a fixed percentage. But I do believe that there should be some connection between the capacity of the teacher to move students grade level to grade level and their compensation. And — and how you measure that could — I'm sure we could learn from the experiences of different schools.
I saw a study that was done in Boston where they looked at the students in a classroom and how many of those students actually improved a full grade by the end of the year. And there were some teachers that regularly moved virtually all of their students a full grade level or more, and there were other teachers who regularly were unable to do that. Well, my view is those that are able to do that should be able to be more highly compensated and — and should also potentially become mentor teachers, with additional compensation, and those that are unable to do that should either develop that skill or perhaps — perhaps find another path in the education world or another career altogether. That's going to be few and far between that can't make it in the profession they've chosen.
But I do believe that those that perform the best, however you determine is the most effective way to measure that, should have an opportunity for better compensation.
MODERATOR: This is our third outing — third year in a row for this conference. Early childhood education looms large, as you might imagine, in this conversation every year. And you know the stats about the achievement gap. You know all that can happen or doesn't happen in a child's life before kindergarten wraps their arms around a child.
Summer slide is a dynamic that — it puts a lot of kids behind. So as a result, kids turn 6, 7 years old; they're already falling behind.
Any initiatives you would bring to early childhood education?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, let me — let me know (sic) something which I — I think almost goes without saying, but I will say it nonetheless. I remember being with a group of teachers, again in Boston, and I said, can you predict which students will stay in school and be successful, and those that will — will drop out, and — and how early can you predict that? And the teachers all began nodding their heads, and I said, well, you know, tell me what you have to say. And they said, well, I — I don't know that I want to have this on camera, they said. We had a camera in the room at the time, and so the camera left, and — and — and one of them said this, said, if — if a teacher-parent night — the parent-teacher night, rather — if the parents show up, then the child's going to be just fine. If the parents don't show up night after night after night to a parent-teacher conference, then that kid's probably not going to make it through high school.
The involvement of parents and particularly where there can be two parents — it's an enormous advantage for the child. And so both in terms of early education and continuing throughout their career, having — certainly an advantage to have two parents, but even then to have one parent that stays closely involved with the education of the child and can be at home in those early years of education can be extraordinarily important.
I also do believe that there are many programs that have been highly effective in — in — in early education. Right here in — in New York City Geoffrey Canada has a — has a program in Harlem that's been just remarkably successful in helping bring young people to a posture where they're ready to learn by the time school starts. And those times of — those types of efforts, I think, should be evaluated, one by one, and we should encourage and support those that are most effective.
MODERATOR: You were lucky enough to attend Cranbrook in suburban Detroit. As of this year, the cost of a full-ride year's tuition is $38,900.
MORE Do you think we owe, as a nation, every pupil in America the equivalent of a $38,900 education every year?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I don't know that a dollar number always equates to how effective the teacher is. I was delighted to have a terrific education at what was a private institution. That's not going to be available for the entire nation, but I — I know that there are teachers in the public system that are every bit as good as those that are in the — the private system.
I remember my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Klaus . She may have been the best teacher I ever had. And — and she was a — a person dedicated to helping her children develop the skills they needed to succeed, and those helped me as I went on through school.
I — I don't know that I'd place a dollar figure upon it, because — in fact, as I look at my own experience in — in my state of Massachusetts, dollar spending per pupil wasn't a very good determining factor of how well the student would do. Remember at one point I — I looked at all the school districts in Massachusetts — we have 351 cites and towns — and I plotted spending per student against the achievement of the average student in each district, and because we test our kids every year, we could see which were the kids doing best in math, English and science, and there was no relationship at all, interestingly. And as a matter of fact, the district that spent the most per pupil and had the smallest classrooms, Cambridge, Massachusetts — their kids were in the bottom 10 percent of our state performers.
So I realized it's not just money, that — that it is — it is instead a focus in how you spend the money, attracting the best and brightest to the profession, promoting the very best, measuring performance of students, giving students the incentives to excel — that's why we put in place the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship.
So I — I — I reject the idea that — that everybody has to have a, if you will, a Harvard expense level degree in order to be successful.
I — I find a lot of people have degrees from a lot of different places, public and private, that are highly successful. Some of the most successful in our nation didn't even complete high school. That's a remarkable thing.
But the key for me is — relates to great teachers and creating families that can support their child in education.
MODERATOR: Let's talk about your school choice initiative. You and I last talked about it during our last interview in London, just prior to the Olympics.
Maybe the antithesis of Cranbrook in Detroit is Denby High School, ZIP Code 48224 — highest number of returning prisoners into society of any place in the nation; in that ZIP Code, among the highest in gang activity. Until it was taken over, it had a 20 percent success in graduation rate.
The kids in Denby who qualify to go to Cranbrook — if they've got a ride, if they've got a way to get there, let's assume they're going to jump at it. Who's going to worry about Denby? Who's going to to support Denby High School? Say nothing of the physical plant and so many of our schools are crumbling. What's your solution for Denby after the kids leave for better options?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I don't know Denby terribly well, but I was in — [chuckles] — I was in Philadelphia, and I — and I saw a school in the — in the inner city of Philadelphia. It looked like it had been built in the last five or 10 years. It was — I think it was K through eighth grade. And — and I understand that the school was closed down, that 90 percent of the kids in that school were not reading at grade level. And so the school was unsuccessful and the city closed it down.
A guy named Kenny Gamble, African-American songwriter, got — took the school over, put in place a charter school. And I went and toured the — the school with him, saw the — the students there. I went to a — a classroom where they were learning to use computers and — and became computer-literate. I went to a room where they were singing and they were in a — in a glee club.
He said all the kids learn to sing and participate in glee club. I said, wait a second, how do you afford music teachers, art teachers, computer classes; how do you do all this? He said, well, I run this like a business. This isn't — this isn't impossible. As I recall, almost 90 percent of the students there now are reading at grade level, and it's the same students.
In my view, this is not a matter of saying just, where can we send a lot of money. We have proven that sending a lot of money to failed schools to pay the same teachers to do the same things will not make any difference. The real key is leadership in drawing the best and brightest to the profession, giving them the right incentives, promoting the very best, helping our students have discipline in the classroom, insisting on the participation of parents.
When I was — when I was governor of Massachusetts, I — I fought very hard to insist that parents — I wanted them to have a — a training class before they sent their kids to school. I wanted parents to have to go to a class to learn about education, to learn about the — the culture of education, to support their child. I got some resistance from some folks who said, well, the poor don't have time to go to your class. I said, I'll hold them on Sundays, hold them on weekends. I — I want people to understand the importance of parental involvement.
Geoffrey Canada here in — in — in New York City has proven that an area that — that's economically depressed, the schools can be among the best in the nation. Look, this — this is a matter of — of the leadership of the schools, the quality of the teachers and the incentives that exist on the part of both parents and teachers for excellence in education. And I — and I — there's no question in my mind, you take the very worst school districts in America with the most troubled student bodies, and you put in some of the best administrators and faculty members, and those schools'll turn around. And a guy like Kenny Gwyn has proven — he's got five charter schools. They're succeeding. And if the regular public school can't succeed, put a charter school in there and let them take a try at it.
MODERATOR: You have said some things about Secretary Duncan that are so complimentary you've had to apologize in front of some Republican groups. The question is, under a Romney administration, would you ask Secretary Duncan to stay on?
MR. ROMNEY: Oh, I haven't — I haven't chosen Cabinet secretaries. But I'll tell you, what — what I liked about — and like about Secretary Duncan —
MODERATOR: Would you consider him?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I — I'm not — I'm not putting anybody in my Cabinet right now, (Brian ?). [laughter] It's a — it's a little presumptuous of me, but just a little. [laughter] But — but — but what I like about — about him is he said, look, I want to have this Race to the Top program, which will give grants to — to the states that encourage innovation and — and specifically that say, we're going to — we're going to compensate teachers based upon their performance, which I — I think is — is the right thing. We're going to — we're going to insist on more school choice. I think that's the right thing. So I like the fact that he encouraged those things.
I — I think — there are some other things I — I don't go along with. He — he wants to promote at the same time a national curriculum. I — I prefer to let states and communities decide what their own curriculum will be, but that's — that's his choice.
But I do believe that his focus on more choice and creating opportunities for the best teachers to be better compensated is a good idea. Teaching is a profession. The — I understand the interests of the teachers' union, and I — I mean, the teachers' union has every right to — to represent their members in the way they think is best for their members. But we have every right to, in fact, say, no, this is what we want to do, which is in the best interest of our children.
And — and I believe in our — in the best interest of our children is to recognize that teaching is a profession, like your profession, like my profession, like lawyers, like doctors, and that the very best are more highly compensated and rewarded and measured. We — we — we don't just presume that because we've been here for a certain number of years, we should get more and more pay every year. Instead, we — we get measured.
And if teachers say, well, there's no good measurement system, we say, well, let's look for one; let's see what does work; let's see if we can agree on some kinds of measures and learn from those things.
But I want the best teachers to be highly compensated. I want starting teachers, particularly those that have extraordinary records, who have a track record in school of excellence and learning, I want them to be well compensated, to be drawn into the profession. Education is about teachers, great leadership and parents. And the union has a different objective. I understand. It's fine for them to promote it. It's not fine for us just to go along with it.
MODERATOR: One or two more questions from me, and then we'll go to the audience.
Secretary Duncan does talk about identifying and borrowing best practices, to use an expression from your world, from all over the world, whether it's Finland or Singapore. You mentioned South Korea. Do you have any (fear ?). It is true that in the past, some American educators have been a little bit arrogant, a little bull-headed about not taking on what works overseas. Would you embrace best practices from other countries?
MR. ROMNEY: Oh, of course, recognizing that there are — there are differences between different nations and the cultures of different people. There are differences in — between different states. I mean, that's one reason why I wouldn't impose what we did in Massachusetts on the entire nation. People can learn from our experience.
We learn from the Florida experience. I think that's one of the most relevant experiences of the most recent years, is to see the reforms Jeb Bush and his legislature put in place and the positive impact that's had on the performance of students in that state. We learn from various states, from various school districts. We learn from nations around the world; they learn from us. And cataloguing those things.
But we have — I mean, I remember back in the business world I was in, if we were making wheels — we had a business that made wheels for trucks. I would have loved to have been able to look at all the truck-wheel manufacturers in the world and go through their factories and see what they were doing differently than us. We would have learned. But we didn't have a to of truck-wheel factories to go tour. And so best practices were limited to the handful of places we could visit.
With schools, we've got thousands, tens of thousands of district — of — of different districts around the world we can learn from. We test our kids. That's — that's why I learned, for instance, in my state, when I — when I — I looked at the performance of different school districts, it's like, wow, this isn't at all what I thought. I thought classroom size was the only thing that I could do to make our schools better. It turned out to be a factor but not the big one. The big — the big factor was — was the quality of teachers and how to reward the very best and give people more choice.
So I — I — yeah, do I want to open up our — our ears to what's being said around the world, to the lessons that are being learned around the world? Yeah, there's nothing but — but good that can come from that.
MODERATOR: I want to go ahead and tell the audience, be free to queue up at the microphones. We'll come to you shortly. Just to confirm, you didn't just claim credit for inventing the wheel, just manufacturing? [laughter]
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah.
MODERATOR: OK. Governor, what do you make of a common core?
MR. ROMNEY: You know, I think it's fine for — for people to — to lay out what they think core subjects might be and to suggest a pedagogy and — and being able to provide that learning to our kids. I — I don't subscribe to the idea of the federal government trying to push a common core on various states. It's one thing to put it out as a model and let people adopt it as they will, but to — to financially reward states based upon accepting the federal government's idea of — of a curriculum, I think, is a mistake.
And the reason I say that is that — that — that there may be a time when the — when the government has an agenda that — that it wants to promote, and I'm not — I'm not wild about the federal government having some kind of agenda that it then compensates states to teach their kids. I'd rather let — let education and what is taught state by state be determined state by state, not by the federal government.
MODERATOR: Last question from me, and then I see — [chuckles] — more than a few people have lined up with questions for you.
Your dad went on a poverty tour of 17 cities back when the need was absolutely acute in this country. And yet at this conference, what's coming up more and more is poverty again —
MR. ROMNEY: Oh yeah.
MODERATOR: — and what a component it is in education, how many teachers have to worry about poverty at home while trying to educate children. Would you consider something akin to what your father did?
MR. ROMNEY: Not only would I consider that, but in — in fact, I get the chance to do that from time to time. And that's — that's why, for instance, I was at Kenny Gamble school in — in — in Philadelphia, was — was seeing what's happening there. Why, I was at Geoffrey Canada's preschool program in — in Harlem to understand what's happening there and the impact of poverty.
And with Geoffrey Canada, for instance — and you've seen this film, "Waiting for 'Superman'," that he figures in quite prominently — he — he goes back to — to talking not just about the school but the home where the children are coming from and how — and he has a program for — for parents that are — that are getting ready to have a child, to prepare that parent to help the child be able to learn. I mean, we start — we have to start very early.
So I — I do, in fact, embrace the — the approach that my dad took. I take that to a great degree myself, did when I was governor and will continue doing that if and when I'm president.
MODERATOR: All right. Governor, thank you. We're going to go to questions with the explanation that this audience is diverse. There are teachers, there are students, there are policymakers. There are even people who, God forbid, might be pushing a certain agenda. So we'll see what we get. [laughter]
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
Q: Governor, first of all, thanks for being here. Brian Williams asked who's responsible for the kids at Denby High School in Detroit. I am. I'm the state superintendent of schools in Michigan. And I need to tell you that my personal shame, frankly, is that we have not been able to make this a better place for kids who are in poverty.
And I think in my work, in seven years in this job now, without being able to move the ball much in those places where there's high poverty, our focus on college and career-ready brings me back to one thing: We don't have kids kindergarten-ready. And until we can get kids kindergarten-ready and be able to read at grade level by third grade, where we teach kids to learn to read till third grade and then they need to learn to read from there on in — we haven't been able to crack that. And it comes back to kind of the early childhood question. What specifically would be your solutions to get kids kindergarten-ready so they can be college-and career-ready?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I — I described that we — we do have programs like Head Start. We can evaluate where those have been effective and where they have been less effective. There are a number of, as you know, private institutions. I happen to be one of those that helped get behind and start — finance a group called Bright Horizons Learning Centers, which has been highly effective, I believe, in preparing young people for — for education.
But I also don't think there's any substitute for the home and — and efforts to teach people who are having children about the needs of a child and preparing for school and preparing to be educated. I think those efforts are also critically important. That — that is — that is going to happen, in some cases, at the hands of government, but also in the hands of private institutions.
In — in — in the city of Boston, one of the most effective efforts was carried out by — by those that led a group called the TenPoint Coalition. And these are leaders of largely African-American churches in the inner-city area that made a real effort to reach out to homes and to change the course of the — of the social life of people who were falling away from school and away from education. So I — the combination of public and private, public-private partnerships, as well as early learning centers such as the ones I've mentioned, can make a difference in helping people become ready for school.
But — but I — I also — I also can note that — that as you look around the world at the — at the places where — where the — the schools are doing the very best and — and young people are — are achieving, they've found ways to prepare children for school, which is not always associated with having the government take over early education, but instead — in some cases it does, but in some cases as well it focuses on the parents.
MODERATOR: Governor, let's take a question from this side of the room.
Q: Good morning, Governor Romney. Ed Massey from the commonwealth of Kentucky. I currently serve as president of the National School Boards Association and sit on the national PTA board as well. And I want to know a little more in detail how you view local school boards and parental involvement in the process of educational reform.
MR. ROMNEY: Well, you know, we have great organizations that represent the — the teachers. We have great organizations that represent the parents, but I'd like to see them have even more clout. [chuckles] I'd like to see — I'd like to see parents very much involved in evaluating the success of schools. If we — if we had a more transparent system for evaluating the success of a school, A through F — I mean, I think schools ought to have report cards the way they do in Florida. And if we had that, then you'd see parents, if they saw their school get a C or a D or worse, those parents are going to be outraged, and they're going to want to gather together, become part of PTA organizations and talk about taking back the school.
We — we — we can't say, hey, kids, you all have a choice to go somewhere else. That's a good thing to be able to have that choice, but we've also got to fix the school itself. And I think parents are oftentimes going to be the impetus, the energy behind real change which must occur in a lot of our local school districts. I imagine you — you found the same thing. Is that right?
Q: I have. And sitting on a local school board for 16 years, I've found that the community engagement is so powerful. If you have parents in schools and you've engaged your community, the school will be successful regardless of the circumstances. That's what I've found.'
MR. ROMNEY: That reminds me of that point I made about the Boston teachers who said, you know, if the parents show up at parent-teacher night, the kid's going to do just fine.
And that's — I mean, that — that just underscores the impact that parents have. The — the idea that somehow, schools are entirely separate from the home, from the economic circumstances of the home, from the social experiences of the home, that's not just reality. The — the home is an integral part of the education system, and the best teachers in the world can't possibly overcome a home that is — that is completely pulling in the — in a very different direction.
We — we have to have a — a collaboration. That's one of the reasons why I proposed in my state that before you could send your child to go to kindergarten, that the parents had to go to a training program to learn about the impact of education. And again, I did — I wasn't able to get it done. It's something I wanted to do and — and something I think that has some merit. We've got to pull up the parents into education because they are — they are a — an essential part of the education experience of their child.
Q: Thank you, Governor.
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you.
MODERATOR: We have just minutes remaining in our prearranged time with Governor Romney, so we're going to try to make this something more of a lightning round. Go ahead.
Q: Good morning. My name is Kanda Swane . I'm a former New York City public school teacher. So my question is about the Common Core. Forty-five states have already chosen to adopt it. And here in New York City, we are full-on implementing. And so my question is, since so many states have already adopted, what resources would you give our states and our teachers to actually implement this successfully for our children?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, the — the — the states have adopted it, and they — they've done so on their own. And if — if they have adopted it freely and think it's a good program, why, they should be able to implement it. We — we developed our own core in the state of Massachusetts. We implemented it on our own, and — and we're able to help drive our kids to be number one performing in the nation.
I — I don't happen to believe that every time there is a good idea that comes along, that federal government should — should now finance the implementation of that. We certainly didn't. States have responsibility for the education of their — their children in their respective borders.
And I'm not looking for more federal spending. I — I mean, I know it's — it is the nature of politics for someone in my position to promise more free stuff, to say we're going to get more — we'll send money, we're going to do this, and people say, boy, he really cares about education.
I really care about education. I care so much about our kids that I don't want to saddle them with trillions and trillions of dollars of debt when they come out of school. And so I'm — I'm just not willing to add more spending to get people happy with me. I'm willing to say, look, education is done at the state level; the federal government provides funding for special needs students and for low-income students, but in terms of implementing the common core, if you've chosen it, congratulations, work on it, and do it within the — the resources of your own state.
MODERATOR: Another question from over here.
Q: Governor Romney, I'm a New York City parent and a member of a school board, elected here in New York City. You talk a lot about choice, but charter schools represent only 4 percent of the schools, at least here in New York. Vouchers don't really fit — fill the bill. For New York City parents, at least, and urban parents, choice means improving all of our public schools because otherwise, you're nibbling at the edges, or we'll be spending the next hundred years fixing it. How do you create choice through our public school system? What do we need to do? How would you do that? How would you change our school system so that we have choice through our public schools for everyone and not just for the small minority who may be going to charter schools or through vouchers or to private schools?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, first of all, I — I note that each state and, actually, each district in each state has a different experience. In my state, we had much more ample opportunity for choice, in part because of the number of Catholic schools we had as well as the number of charter schools we had. But we also could allow students to go to other public schools. They — they had — they had the capacity not just to stay within the school of their district but to go beyond.
I understand in the case of Florida that — that their school choice program allows students not just to go to charter schools but also to other public schools of their choice. And they — they provide students the capacity to make that — that selection. And I think that — I — I can't tell you what — what can be done here in New York — in New York City, but I can tell you that I think it helps a young person to know that they have the ability to make a school choice that they think is consistent with their — with their education needs and that if you don't have any charter schools, that's going to mean choice of different public schools.
But — but fundamentally, choice is one of the ingredients of improving our schools. But the key is really the teachers in the schools we already have and rewarding the very best and brightest, attracting the very best into the teaching profession, treating them like the professionals they are, giving them the support that — that they need to have and, in some cases, recognizing that the interest of the teachers union may not be entirely coincident with the interest of the students.
I think we have to put our kids and the teachers and the parents first and the teachers union behind. I mean, I — you know, I don't know whether "Waiting for Superman" was an accurate reflection of some of the issues in the New York City schools, but if it was, it was very troubling.
Q: If I could just say one thing, in New York City, the parents here support the union to protect our kids 3-to-1 over the mayor and the chancellor. That's a recent poll. So to say that the unions are holding back our kids, as a parent, and as parents — in polls said the opposite. They believe that, actually, the unions are fighting for our kids and that a lot of the reform has been holding back our kids and against our kids and that this is not — this is not me. This is coming from a poll of parents.
MR. ROMNEY: I don't believe it.
Q: In Chicago — and in Chicago —
MR. ROMNEY: I don't believe it for a minute. I don't believe it for a minute. I know something about polls. [chuckles] (Laughter, boos.)
And I — and I know you can ask questions to get any answer you want. And I — and I — and I do know this, that — that — that having looked at schools, I know that the teachers' union has a responsibility to care for the interests of the teachers. And the head of the national teachers' union said at one point, we don't care about kids, we care about the teachers.
That's their right, but the people who are on the school boards and the parents, they're the people who have the primary interest in the kids. And by the way, there may be some politicians that don't get it right, but I believe that you have to recognize that — that a union has a different constituency than the parents have.
And the people who are elected to represent the kids — whether they're doing a good job or not, I don't know, but I can tell you this: Jeb Bush stood up to the teachers' unions in Florida, and that made a difference. And I also believe that Arne Duncan, by standing up for — for the kids, has made a difference.
I believe that we — we simply — we simply can't have a setting where the teachers' unions are able to contribute tens of millions of dollars to the campaigns of politicians, and then those politicians, when elected, stand across them at the bargaining table, supposedly to represent the interests of the kids. I think it's a mistake. I think we've got to get the money out of the teachers' unions going into campaigns. It's the wrong way for us to go. We got to separate that.
MODERATOR: Let's head from a student.
Q: Hi. My name is Nikkel Goyal . I'm a high school from New York, and I just wrote a book on education.
My question is, considering that the advent of standardized testing has increased historic levels, causing a lot of teaching to the test, billions of dollars into testing, and really the killing of productivity in many ways, how would you as president change this trend, and how would you put students directly in your own administration and let them have a voice in this policy decision-making process?
MR. ROMNEY: First of all, you'll find throughout your life that there are tests. And I — and I don't — I don't know a way to evaluate the progress of students other than by evaluating it through testing of some kind or another.
If there are tests that are ineffective or that — that measure things that are not really relevant, why, obviously, you try and improve the test. But you'll have an SAT when you graduate from high school. You'll — if you want to go into graduate school, you'll have a — a — a — an advanced test, a GMAT or other test, and you'll find throughout your life that there are going to be tests. And we always complain about them. I complained about them — [chuckles] — when I was a student. And we don't like tests, but — but there's really no other way we've found out to determine whether — whether a student is succeeding or not succeeding and, frankly, whether the teacher is succeeding or not succeeding.
So I — I don't have a better model than saying we're going to evaluate our kids through some kind of a — of a testing system. When I became governor of Massachusetts, we had this graduation exam. I took it, because I would hear from teachers, we're having to teach to the test. I took the exam, and I passed it, by the way. But I — [laughter] — although I took it at home, so no one really got to see my — [laughter] — my answers.
But — but — but you know, when I got to the math section, there — there was, you know, geometry, algebra, calculus, trigonometry. I mean, there — there — these were the topics there. I don't know what teaching to the test would mean if it were not teaching basic math skills. On the — on the — the language side, I read paragraphs, and then I wrote down — or excuse me, I checked off the things I'd seen in the paragraph. If teaching to the test means learning how to read and write and learning how to do basic math skills, then there's nothing terribly wrong with that. I added science, and — and so people are going to get tested in biology and geology and so forth.
This is — this is part of what we expect schools to do. What I was concerned about before we had these kind of tests is that we might have faculty members go off in a completely different tangent from the basic math and English and science skills our — our kids need to succeed. So I'm not going to replace testing. I'd love to improve it. That's why when No Child Left Behind was passed, the authors said, we'll let each state create your own test and evaluate how well students are doing.
But I'm — I'm going to keep in place the testing. And as — as with regards to the student involvement, I hope students are very involved in the political process and in the process of the quality of your education.
I'd love to have the — the students grade the teachers at the end of the year as opposed to just the other way around so that — that teachers get feedback. We did that when I — when I got to graduate school. We got to grade the teachers. And then it was published. They — they put it up for the whole school to see, in business school, how each teacher did on a whole series of dimensions. And it helped. It helped the teachers.
I — I — I think — you know, I believe in a lot of feedback. So far from being a guy who would say, let's stop testing, I — I'd just try and make our testing more effective, expand it in ways that maybe haven't been thought of before and recognized. We need to drive the quality of education, and it's one tool; we have to do it.
MODERATOR: And by the way, one tip: Going to Harvard Business School makes you very good at taking tests in the future.
MR. ROMNEY: (Laughs.)
MODERATOR: Governor, our time has reached its conclusion. On behalf of all of us affiliated with Education Nation, thank you very much for taking our questions. [applause]

Remarks with Paul Ryan at a Campaign Event in Vandalia, Ohio

September 25, 2012

RYAN: Hey — [inaudible] — appreciate it. [inaudible] — buddy. [cheers and applause] Wow.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! [cheers and applause]
REP. RYAN: O-H! [cheers]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [inaudible]
REP. RYAN: O-H!
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [inaudible]
REP. RYAN: Works every time. [chuckles]
[laughter] I got my lucky buckeye. [cheers] My buddy Rob Portman gave me this lucky buckeye.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic.)
REP. RYAN: It means we're going to win Ohio. [cheers]
I'll tell you the other reason why we're going to win Ohio. We are going to give you, our fellow citizens, a clear choice. We owe you that.
You see, our choice is do we stay on the same path we are on, the one that Obama put us on, a nation in debt, in doubt, in decline —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
REP. RYAN: — or do we reclaim those founding principles that made us so great in the first place and get this country back on the right track? [cheers and applause]
Look, after four years, the recovery that President Obama promised is nowhere in sight. He said that if he just could borrow a bunch of money and spend it on his friends, unemployment would never get above 8 percent. It's been above 8 percent for 43 months! We have 23 million Americans struggling to find work. Fifteen percent of our fellow countrymen and -women are in poverty today.
Look, President Obama — the economy is barely growing. He's run out of ideas. And just the other day on TV he said that he can't change Washington from the inside. [boos]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, get him out! Get him out!
REP. RYAN: Why do we send presidents to Washington in the first place? [chuckles] I mean, isn't that what we're supposed to do?
Don't we send them to fix the mess in Washington?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!
REP. RYAN: Look, if he can't change Washington, then we need to change presidents. And we need to elect this man, Mitt Romney, the next president of the United States. [cheers and applause]
The choice before us is very clear. We are offering real reforms for a real recovery. We cannot afford four more years of President Obama's failed policies.
Now, what Mitt Romney is offering, what we are saying is here are big ideas, big solutions that are designed to get people back to work, proven pro-growth policies to get our country back on track. Number one, right here in Ohio, all across America, we have a lot of our own energy; let's go get that energy, use that energy and put people back to work! [cheers and applause] Gas, oil, coal, renewables, all of the above. It's here. It's ours. And on day one, you know what he's going to do? He's going to say yes to the Keystone pipeline so we can get that oil coming to our country. [cheers and applause]
Number two, you know, in our states, in our Midwestern manufacturing states, we've lost a lot of work. A lot of people in the prime of their lives, in their 40s and their 50s, they're in between. You know — [inaudible] — is a great example. And we have to have a system so those people can get the skills they need to get back on track, to get back into a career of the 21st century so that American dream can be placed back within their reach.
We need skills. We need to fix our schools. We need to honor the parents and the children and not the special interests that are standing in the way of these educational reforms. [cheers and applause]
We need trade that works for America so we can make more things in America and sell them overseas, and Mitt will get more into that.
But there is one thing that we — that the four of us have talked about, we've worked on, we have fought for. It's a really simple idea. We can't keep spending money we just don't have.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!
REP. RYAN: We have got to balance this budget. We got to get this debt under control. It is our duty to save the American dream for our children and our grandchildren and to save it for our economy today.
We also have to remember — let's never forget this — that most of our jobs in this country come from those small businesses in this country, from those successful small businesses in this country. We need to reform our tax system so it's fair, simple and competitive. We need to re-acknowledge the idea that if you have a small business, you built that small business. [cheers and applause] You get the credit for that.
Friends, the Obama economic agenda failed not because it was stopped, but because it passed. [chuckles] (Scattered laughter.) Let's not forget that in his first two years, he had total control of government. You ever heard of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid? [boos] I'll take that as a yes. [chuckles] (Scattered laughter.) He got almost everything he wanted.
And then the next two years he spent regulating. This is killing jobs. This is plaguing our businesses with uncertainty.
We have specific ideas and plans to get people back to work, to get this economy growing again, to create 12 million jobs, to get job security, to get better pay — take-home pay, to get people back on the path of opportunity. You see, we know that the genius of this country is the worker, it's the small-business person, it's the entrepreneur — it's the person that's not our government.
[cheers and applause]
So after four years of getting the runaround, what America needs is a turnaround. [cheers] And this is the man who knows how to do turnarounds. [cheers and applause]
You know what we also believe, and especially here in Dayton? We believe in peace through strength. And that means not gutting our military, not compromising Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, not shutting down that tank plant in Lima. That means a peace-through-strength doctrine.
I see a Marine right there. I see Army right there. I saw a Navy guy right over here. And I know there is somebody from Air Force here. Thank you for your service to our country. We will honor you. And we will have a strong national security. And that means job security in Ohio as well. [cheers and applause]
This is the moment where the moment and the man are meeting. We need leadership. We need someone who'll be honest with us about our problems, who will not blame other people for the next four years, who will take responsibility, who will not duck the tough issues but will actually fix things. That's this man right here. [cheers and applause]
When his country called, and when they asked him to save the Olympics, he left what he was doing, and he beautifully served, and he saved it. This is a man who knows how the economy works because he's created over 10,000 jobs. [cheers and applause]
You know what, by the way? I think it's a good thing that he's a successful businessman — [cheers] — because being successful in business is something we want. [cheers and applause] We're proud of people's success.
We want more of success in this country. [cheers and applause] And when this man was governor —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!
REP. RYAN: — and as governor, when this man was governor, he didn't blame, he didn't duck, he didn't demagogue; he got things done. Unemployment went down. The credit rating was improved. Household income went up. He reached across the aisle. He didn't compromise his principles. And he balanced the budget without raising taxes. That's the kind of leadership we finally need in Washington. [cheers and applause] That's not what we have. And ladies and gentlemen, he has not only succeeded, but he succeeded where others could not.
This president is not succeeding.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
REP. RYAN: This president cannot run on his record.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
REP. RYAN: This president is going to say anything and everything to try and blame, to try and duck, to try and distort, to try and divide, to try and distract, to try and win by default. And you know what, Ohio? We are not going to let them, because are going to elect Mitt Romney the next president of the United States.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mitt Romney. [cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Wow! That's quite a guy, isn't it? Paul Ryan! Isn't that something? [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: Wait a second. Wait a second. Romney-Ryan, Romney-Ryan, Romney-Ryan. There we go. All right.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Romney-Ryan.
MR. ROMNEY: That's great.
Thank you, Senator Rand Paul, for being here. And you're a great senator. [cheers and applause]
Rob Portman. Thank you, Rob Portman. He's campaigned for me all over the country. Do you know what he does on weekends? Do you know what he does?
He plays Barack Obama. Can you believe that? [laughter] He does — he plays Barack Obama. He plays him well too, I hate to tell you. We get the chance to debate one another. After the, you know, hour and a half or so is over, I like — I want to, you know, kick him out of the room or something. [laughter] He's so good. But he doesn't convince me. Actually, when he gets finished, he said, you beat me again, you beat me again. [cheers] Now, he likes my arguments, you see. He's a better debater, but he likes my arguments better, he knows they're right.
Lee Greenwood — where is Lee Greenwood [cheers and applause] Lee? I don't know where he is, but I heard him. There he is, right there, proud to be an American. Thank you, sir. Thank you one more time. This guy, he sang it right, he said it right. I'm proud to be an American.
I'm proud to be here with so many who serve our country. Wright-Patt, what a contribution that makes to our country and has over the years. I've been to that base, met with the leaders there and members of our armed services there. How many members of the armed services are veterans here? Would you raise your hand?
Wow, look at that. Look at that. [cheers and applause] I love that national hymn, one of our national hymns: "O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife who more than self their country love and mercy more than life." Thank you to our veterans and our members of the armed services. [cheers and applause]
If I'm president of the United States — [cheers] — nah, correct that; when I'm president of the United States — [cheers] — I will not cut our military budget or our commitment to keep America's military second to none in the world. [cheers and applause]
This — this is an election which is a dramatic choice for the American people. It's the question about the soul of America. What is America going to be? We know the course the president has laid out his plan for the next four years. If you — if you watch their convention or read about his speech, you know what he said. He said, we're going to go forward, he said. More of the same. I think forewarned is a better term, by the way.
But he had no new ideas. He had no plan for how he's going to get the economy going, how he's going to create jobs or rising take-home pay. Instead, it was a repeat of what he said four years ago. He's going to bring the deficit down. Of course he didn't; he doubled it. He's going to get more people working; of course, he didn't. We still have, as Paul indicated, over 8 percent unemployment.
His plan is another stimulus. How'd that first one go? All right? About $800 billion. How much of that did you get?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: None!
MR. ROMNEY: Well, there was cash for clunkers. Did you get help from that?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No.
MR. ROMNEY: No. His idea now — he's got one new — he's got one new idea. I admit this. He has one thing he did not do in his first four years, he said he's going to do in the next four years, which is to raise taxes. And is there anybody who thinks that raising taxes will help grow the economy?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: No, his plan is to continue what he has done before. The status quo has not worked. We cannot afford four more years of Barack Obama. We're not going to have four more years of Barack Obama.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No! [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: His plan and his approach says fundamentally that government knows better than you how to live your life, how to pick winners and losers, how to choose companies that can be successful and products that have a future; that government, that a group of bureaucrats, of real smart people working hard — I mean, there are good people who work in Washington, but he has this view that somehow they know better than free people. So he's going to put them in the most important, or one of the most important, relationships that you have, and that's the relationship between you and your doctor. He's going to put government between there if he has his way.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: He wants a government that's more and more expansive and intrusive. He — do you know how much money he spent in one year putting money into companies that he thought had a bright future, green companies? He spent $90 billion, $90 billion — [booing] — and sent it into companies, in many cases, that were — were owned by campaign contributors of his.
Look, this is a — this is a vision of government that's entirely foreign to anything this nation has ever known, the idea of a larger and larger government taking more and more from the people, intruding itself in your relationship with your doctor, investing, so to speak, in companies, picking winners and losers or, in his case, losers. [laughter]
Look, that is not the America I know. That is not the America that built Ohio. That's not the America that we're going to restore. We're going to return America to the principles that made this nation the hope of the earth. [cheers and applause]
I have an entirely different course. I will restore the principles that the founders described when they wrote the Declaration of Independence. The foundation of our nation said this, that our rights did not come from government; our rights came from God himself. [cheers] And among those rights were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. [cheers] We are free in this nation to pursue happiness as we choose.
And now and then there is a person out there that has some idea and goes out and pursues it, not because the government told her to do it, but because this idea came into their mind, and they said I'm going to go out there and try this idea. Most of the ideas don't work. It's the nature of starting something up. But now and then they really do. And what they do, they lift other people who get to work there. And if they're successful beyond their dreams, many, many people get great jobs and a bright future. That's how our economy works. (Murmurs of approval.)
It does not — it is not driven by government; it is driven by free people. And if this president persists on the road of making it harder and harder for small businesses to grow and thrive, he's going to slowly but surely weaken our economy and turn us into Greece, and we must not let it happen. [cheers and applause]
I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to restore that principle of free enterprise, that principle of people pursuing their dreams as they wish. We're a nation of dreamers. We want our kids to get an education that will give them the skills so they can dream and build their own future.
That's the nature of how America works.
He just can't do that because he gets his largest single funding from the teachers' union. Nothing wrong with the teachers' union, but I just think the president of the United States should be focused on the deeds of the kids, not focused on the needs of the teachers' union. [cheers and applause] I want to put our kids — I want to put our kids and the teachers themselves and the parents first and the union behind. [cheers and applause]
Small business — Paul Ryan said, we got to help small business. Boy, is he right. It's tough out there getting a business going. I want these people to make the investment and start opening doors and hiring people. I've seen these entrepreneurs across America. It's — it's extraordinary to see what's happening.
I — I met a woman who — she has her own business. And I said, how did you get going in business? She said, well, my husband lost his job, and he took a class in upholstering. And she — because she was a better business mind, she said, in the family, she decided to start her own company. So she did and hired him as her first employee. [laughter] And then she went on to hire 39 more people as upholsterers. And she has a leading upholstery company. And that puts people to work. That's kind of how America works. [cheers and applause]
And then I met a guy named Jim Leotaud in central Illinois. Jim graduated second in his high school class, second from the bottom. [laughter] And he concluded that college was not part of his future. And he went to his dad and said, would you float me a loan, start a business together? He was going to do the work, and his dad would put up the money, and they agreed to split it about 50-50. And Jim was going to start a food business. And he went out to buy one of those hamburger griddles, you know, on those — those hot-dog rollers and that — you know, the ventilation hoods. And — and by the time he costed it all out, it was a lot more money than he had from his dad.
He concluded the only thing he could do in the food business with the money he had was make sandwiches because sandwiches don't take much equipment, all right? So he got some tables, you know, and set them up in a garage and started making sandwiches and then he would deliver them to people at work or at school and in colleges. And now Jimmy Johns has 1,500 restaurants — [cheers and applause] — and employs 60,000 Americans! [cheers and applause]
Look, this is the — this is the fundamental question Americans have to ask. Do we believe that government bureaucrats are better at telling us what kind of health care we ought to have and what kind of insurance we ought to have? Do we believe that they're better at telling us which businesses to invest in, like Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1, or do we instead believe that free people pursuing their dreams will build a stronger economy? That's what I believe. [cheers and applause]
This president has a plan for small business. He's got a plan for small business. He's going to raise their taxes. I was with a — an entrepreneur in St. Louis who's in the electronics industry in a small way. He has four employees. And he said, you know, my son and I calculated how much tax we send to government. And, you know, I had a number in mind as he began saying that to me, as to what I thought he was going to say. And then he went through. He said, I calculated my federal income tax, my federal payroll tax, my state income tax, my state sales tax, my gasoline tax and my real estate tax, and by the time I added it up, more than half of what we make in my business we give to government.
And I thought — now, you think about this. You think about taking the risk of starting an enterprise that's going to hire other people when you know you haven't even got a 50-50 chance the business will succeed, because most small businesses, they struggle, they don't make it. So you know you might lose your money. But if you're successful, if you make it, the government wants half of what you make. And what's the president's plan for small business? Raise taxes further.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No!
MR. ROMNEY: For a million small businesses in this country, he wants to take the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.
And what that will do is kill jobs.
This is a president who is bent on growing government. I am bent on growing jobs and raising take-home pay and will do it! [cheers and applause]
Now Paul — Paul Ryan described the five things we're going to do: Number one, take advantage of energy, and number two, fix our schools and training programs, and number three — I'll come back to number three, not that I forgot it. Number four — [laughter] — number four, we're going to balance our budget, because you're not going to invest in America if you think we're headed to Greece. And number five, we're going to champion small business.
But coming back to number three, that's trade. Look, trade is good for us. The people in Ohio can sell products anywhere in the world, and we can compete with anywhere in the world. I'm not afraid of trading with other nations. I understand that when we trade and when other nations trade on a fair basis, we will compete, we will win, we'll raise wages here, we'll create jobs.
But I also understand that when people cheat, that kills jobs. China has cheated. I will not allow that to continue. [cheers and applause]
And it — it's not over. I mean, how does a nation cheat? How do you pull that off? Let me tell you how you pull it off. One way is to artificially hold down the value of your currency, to make sure it doesn't trade openly around the world. And you — what — what does that do? Well, let me tell you what it does. It makes your products artificially less expensive.
The estimates are that China has held down the value of its currency anywhere between 15 and 30 percent, and so their products will be 15 to 30 percent cheaper. Guess what that does to the American companies that are competing in those industries. They lose sales, and so they have to lay off people. And ultimately they go out of business, and that's been happening. They've been manipulating, holding down the value of their currency.
What else do they do? They steal intellectual property. What do I mean by that? Patents, designs, know-how, even counterfeit our goods.
I was with a — a — a company in the Midwest that — that said that they had some products that were coming back, valves. These are industrial valves, great big heavy industrial valves — said they were getting warranty claims on these — these valves of theirs that were breaking. And they were their product. They had their packaging on it. They had their serial numbers on it. And then they realized they're counterfeit; these aren't actually our product; they've been sold as our product, under our brand name, with our — with our bar codes, everything else associated with them.
And these — these products are coming into this country, being counterfeited overseas. That kills jobs. That's what they've been doing. There's an Apple Store in China. Have you — you read about that one? They got a store, Apple Store, selling Apple, you know, iPads and iPhones, except it's not an Apple Store. It's all counterfeit. Look, this kind of practice has to stop. They even have hacked into our computers. Our government, with the F-35 and the designs for the F-35 — they've looked at computers of our corporations.
This cannot be allowed. We cannot compete with people who don't play fair, and I won't let that go on. I will stop it in its tracks. [cheers and applause]
You guys, I love this country. And I know it's based upon — this — this — this nation is — is a nation that makes me proud. I love the people of this country. I've had the chance during this campaign to see folks from — from all over this great state and from all over this great country. I know what it's going to take to bring us back. Paul and my plan will create 12 million jobs and will cause take-home pay to go up. Look, it's gone down every year for four straight years.
How in the world can people say they want four more years of President Obama? We can't afford four more years of President Obama. [cheers and applause] We will turn this country around and create good jobs again. And let me tell you, it matters. It really matters. It matters for 23 million people who are struggling to get a good job. It matters for the 50 percent of our college graduates coming out of school that — that can't find work.
How in the world these kids think they ought to vote for Barack Obama is beyond me. It's, like, look at your friends, half of you can't find work. Don't you understand where he's taking this country? (Murmurs of approval.) It matters for our kids — for the next generation. Where we pass along trillion-dollar debts, it's not just bad economics, it's immoral for us to pass on debts like that to our kids. So it matters. It matters what direction we take.
And it also matters for the world. I — I was lucky enough to be in Poland a few weeks ago, got to meet with a — a hero, a world hero, Lech Walesa. What a guy. [cheers and applause] Shipyard worker. You know what, in that country, the Soviet Union, as they came in, executed some 20,000 Polish leaders, executed them, wrote down their names and so forth. This is not — this is not conjecture. And yet despite that history, that man a shipyard worker, said no to the Soviet Union. And by virtue of what he did, he helped change the world.
So I got a chance to sit down and talk to to him. And I came in to meet with him. And he — he looked at me, and he said, you must be tired, you came from the United States. He said, you sit. I'll talk. You listen. [laughter] He was a serious guy, so I did. [laughter] And — and then he said this, he said America is the only superpower on the planet. We need American leadership. And then he described a place in the world, the Middle East, for instance. And then he'd say, where is American leadership? We need American leadership. Then he'd go to another place in the world and talk about a problem and say, where is American leadership?
This doesn't mean that we send our guns there. This means that we stand up with our economic power, our soft power, our diplomatic power, our principles. We fight with people we believe in. It means that when people in Tehran take to the streets protesting an illegal election of Ahmadinejad, we have a president that says something, that doesn't stay silent. [cheers and applause]
It means that with the developments in the Middle East these days, when we have — when we have a — an ambassador assassinated, when we have 20,000 people killed in Syria, when we have a Muslim Brotherhood leader become the new president of Egypt, when we have Iran moving closer and closer to a nuclear weapon, we — we don't have a president calling these things bumps in the road; we have a president who takes this serious and gets America on track to shape world affairs.
[cheers and applause]
And so it matters. American leadership matters. And I can tell you this: For us to have leadership, we have to have strong homes and strong values and a commitment to our principles. We also have — have to have an economy second to none. And finally, we have to have a military no one would ever think of testing. I will bring those three things back to America and keep America strong. [cheers and applause]
If you agree with Paul and me and with these two great senators that we can't afford four more years of Barack Obama, that we can't afford more years of wondering whether our kids can find a good job when they get out of school, if we can't afford more weeks wondering if we can put food on the table at the end of the week — if you agree with me, then I need you to find people who went out there and voted for Barack Obama and convince them to join our team, because together we're going to strengthen this country, we're going to make sure it provides the jobs we need, we're going to keep it the hope of the earth. The world needs American leadership. We do, and we're going to bring it. [cheers and applause]
Thank you so very much. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Toledo, Ohio

September 26, 2012

Thank you! Wow, thank you! What a welcome! Thank you! [cheers and applause] Wow! You guys, you're great! Thank you so much!
Now we're in Toledo! We're in Toledo, right? [cheers and applause] So it's o-h — (crowd responds "i-o!") — OK, that's where we are!
Well, it's great to be here with you today. Thank you so much for that welcome. [cheers and applause]
Thank you, Congressman Latta, appreciate your help in welcoming me here today.
My goodness, how many people are in this room? This is extraordinary! [cheers and applause] Thank you!
You know, the president just the other day said that you can't change Washington from the inside, you can only change it from the outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance on November 2nd! [cheers and applause]
I know that they're out there chanting at his events "four more years." But let me ask you this, do you want four more years with 23 million people struggling to find a job? (Crowd boos.) Do you want four more years where half our kids coming out of college can't find a college-level job? (Crowd responds, "no!") Do you want four more years of trillion-dollar deficits? (Crowd responds, "no!")
Look, I don't want four more years any more than you do, but I can tell you this. If President Obama were to be reelected, what you'd see is four more years like the last four years, and we can't afford another four years like the last four years! [cheers and applause]
His plan for America, did you hear it at his convention? Did you hear all the new ideas? (Crowd responds, "no!") Yeah, there weren't any. There weren't any. [laughter] It's the status quo. It's what he's been saying for the past four years, to get out there and he wants another stimulus, all right, and then he wants to be able to pick winners and losers, make government investments.
By the way, government investments, that means taking your money and he invests it in the businesses owned by his friends. That's not my kind of investing. (Crowd boos.)
More deficits, of course, trillion-dollar deficits. Do you see that clock up there? Sixteen trillion dollars in debt. When his campaign began, it was a heck of a lot less than that. When the president was elected, it was about 10-point-something (billion dollars). He's added about $6 trillion in debt to the country. That's not good for the economy, it's not good for jobs, and in my view I think it's immoral for us to pass on obligations to our kids, of that nature. We've got to stop it! [cheers and applause]
Do you realize what that number means, by the way, to your kids and to you? Do you know how much you're paying for that? You might just think that's, oh, that's debt out there, someone will repay it someday, maybe our kids or grandkids.
That's not how it works. You pay interest on that right now. People in America are paying interest. How much interest are they paying? More than all that is spent on housing by our government, agriculture, all that's spent on education, transportation. Think of that — housing, education, agriculture, transportation, all combined. Don't spend as much as the interest on that debt, we will stop adding to that debt and we'll finally get America on track to a balanced budget. It's the right thing to do! [cheers and applause]
Look, I'm going to take America in a very different direction than this president. [cheers and applause] And this — this election comes down to a choice. It comes down to a choice of path. His campaign slogan is "forward," forward with the same ideas, the same approaches he's had for the last four years. Nothing is going to change, and we know the result of the last four years, so we don't have to wonder what would happen if he were reelected.
We see it! We see the high unemployment. We see the 23 million people out of work. We see kids coming out of school that can't find jobs. We see manufacturing. Manufacturing jobs in the last four years have dropped by 582,000 people. This is not the path we want for America! (Crowd responds, "no!")
There's a different path, and the path I represent is one which will add 12 million new jobs — [cheers and applause] — that will get rising take-home pay again.
There are five things I'll do. Five things I'll do to get this economy going right from the state. Number one, I'm going to take full advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear — [cheers and applause] — our renewables — [cheers and applause] — this is an extraordinary resource! And by the way, that means lower prices at the pump. [applause]
By the way, under this president, prices at the pump have doubled, all right? Now, I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure we create as much energy of our own as we can. We're going to have North American energy independence within eight years. [cheers and applause] That's going to happen!
And not only does it mean lower prices at the pump and hopefully get the prices down of our electricity as well from where they otherwise would be, but it also means more jobs. Because if we have whole exploitation of our oil, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables, our coal, why, we'd have more jobs in the energy sector, and we'd also have more manufacturing that comes back here. Because if we have low-cost, abundant energy, manufacturing is going to beat a path back to here! We're going to get more jobs here! [cheers and applause]
So number one is energy.
Number two — number two relates to trade. Trade has to work for us. We can compete with anyone in the world. And so I'm going to open up new markets for us to be able to sell goods to.
But I'll tell you what else I'm going to do. I'm going to crack down on China. They should not steal our jobs unfairly. That can't continue! [cheers and applause]
Over the past decades, they've held down the value of their currency. You wonder, what does that mean? What does that do? Here's what it does. It means the prices of their products are artificially low. And so if you're an American company manufacturing a product that competes with their product, why, their prices are low. And so the American company ultimately goes out of business and we lose the jobs.
That's what's been happening over the years of one year after the other. The president has had multiple opportunities to label China a currency manipulator. He hasn't; I will. (Cheers, applause.
)
Number three — number three — to make sure we have a great prospect for our people today, I want to have job-training programs that work for the American worker. And that means that instead of having 47 different federal training programs that report to eight different agencies with all sorts of overhead, I'm going to take the dollars that the federal government spends, bundle it up, give Ohio its fair share and let Ohio create its own job-training program for its own people! [cheers and applause]
And to make sure that we're not just training our current workers for the jobs of today, but also our future workers for the jobs of tomorrow, I'm going to make sure we fix our schools. We know how to do that, by that way. [cheers] We know it's key in our schools.
You know, you'll hear a lot of confusion because people have — some people have a big interest in the outcome as to how money is spent in education. But a lot of people have looked at this issue. My state of Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one in the nation. Four federal measures, on all four ranked number one.
How did we get there? We got there because we understand the key to a great school is having great teachers. We need to put our teachers and our kids and our families first, and the teachers union behind! [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four — we're not going to have entrepreneurs go out and start a new business or big companies come here and decide to build a new facility, a new plant and hire a lot of people if they think we're on the road to Greece. And that clock up there, that clock up there looks like Greece.
If President Obama were to be reelected, we'd have about a $20 trillion debt by the end of his next term. That will not happen because he's not going to get reelected. I will balance our budget — [cheers and applause] — and get America to live within its means!
Let me mention something else. One more. Number one was making sure, for instance, that we take advantage of our energy resources. Number two was making sure that we have the opportunity to get our people to have the skills they need to succeed. And trade that works for us. And number four is to make sure we balance our budget.
And number five — let me tell you what this is. We need to champion small business. We need to help small business — [cheers and applause] — get on its feet and grow because small business is where jobs come from. [cheers and applause] And the president's plan — the president's plan, by the way, you know what it is. He plans on raising taxes. He's already said he's going to raise taxes on some 1 million small businesses. One million small businesses in this country are taxed as individuals; he wants to raise the tax rate on them. That will kill jobs. (Crowd boos.) I'm going to lower the tax rates; he wants to raise them. I'll create jobs; he'll kill them! [cheers and applause]
A study — there was a study put out by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. They had Ernst & Young look at his tax proposal. They concluded that his tax proposal will cost 700,000 jobs. We can ill-afford that.
My tax proposal? It creates 7 million jobs. I want to create jobs! [cheers and applause] His plans don't do that.
There's something else about small business. There's something else that's scaring small business. There was a survey done by the Chamber of Commerce. They surveyed members across the country. They asked them, what's the effects of "Obamacare" in your hiring plans? And the people came back, three-quarters of them said it made them less likely to hire people.
I will repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with real health care reform! [cheers and applause]
You see, "Obamacare" is really exhibit number one of the president's political philosophy, and that is that government knows better than people how to run your lives. (Crowd boos.) It is a view that government should stand between you and your doctor.
I don't believe in a bigger and bigger government taxing more and more, more intrusive in our lives, more directing and compelling of our enterprises, telling us what kind of energy we can have, taking $90 billion and investing it in green energy companies.
I believe in free people pursuing their dreams. I believe in freedom! [cheers and applause]
Now, of course, government has a role. We have people that are hurting. We have people who are disabled and people who are poor. They need our help and they receive our help. We're a charitable people. No nation on earth is as charitable as the people of the United States of America. And so we're going to help those that need our help. We're a compassionate people. [applause]
At the same time, we're going to insist that these people have the opportunity for work if they can carry out work, if they're able-bodied. [cheers and applause] Because we are not going to create a society of dependence on government! [cheers and applause]
Look, this president has put us on a path to become like Europe. (Crowd boos.) Europe doesn't work in Europe — [laughter] — I don't want it here. I don't want a government that gets larger and larger, that has huge debts like that I don't want an America where we have chronic high unemployment year after year after year, where there's no wage growth.
Do you realize what's happened to the income of the median family in America? Their income has gone down every year for the past four years. It's come down some 8.2 percent, I believe the number is, under the Obama years. Think about that. American families are having a hard time, incomes are down. At the same time, the cost of food is up. The cost of electricity is up. The cost of health care is way up. The cost of gasoline is double.
The American family, middle-income families are having a hard time.
Look, I know the president cares about America and the people of this country, he just doesn't know how to help them. I do! I'll get this country going again! [cheers and applause]
Now, I have confidence in our future. I recognize that America is going to come roaring back. Were we to reelect President Obama, there's no question in my mind we'd face four more difficult years.
If instead, I — no, instead — when I become president — [cheers and applause] — we're going to get this economy growing again. We're going to do the things that ignite this economy. Those five things I describe will get America's economy going again, will help people find jobs that need those jobs, will get take-home pay to come up again. This is not a mystery.
We know how to do it. America has faced challenges before. When we have strong leaders, when we have people who know how to lead and where to lead, we can get it done! And I am; and we will! [cheers and applause]
You know — (crowd chants, "Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!") — [cheers and applause] — I believe in America. And I believe in you. I believe you're going to help me win Ohio, I'll tell you that. All right? [cheers and applause]
We love this country. We know what it stands for. We know the power of freedom. We take our inspiration from the founding documents: the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. [cheers and applause] We believe the Founders were right when they said that our rights came from God, not from government, but from God — [cheers and applause] — and among those rights — among those rights were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
And that last phrase, don't forget it, that last phrase really means something — pursuit of happiness. What that means is that in this country we can pursue happiness as we choose. We're not told by our government what we can accomplish. We're not limited by the circumstance of our birth.
I was with Marco Rubio the other day. You know Marco? [cheers and applause] He said, growing up there were some big homes not far from where he lived. He said, I never heard my parents say, why don't those people give us some of what they have? Instead they said, aren't we lucky to live in a country where if we work hard and take some risks and get as much education as possible, we can achieve that ourselves. [cheers and applause]
America's economy — America's economy is driven by freedom, it's not guided by government. That's how the Europeans did it. That did not work.
The reason we have surpassed them, the reason we have grown to become the most powerful economy in the history of the earth is not because of government bureaucrats telling us how to live our lives or what to invest in or telling us what kind of health care we can have.
Instead, free American people, living their lives as they freely choose, that's what America what we are! We're a nation of dreamers! [cheers and applause]
Now, I know you've been outside for a long time, but I want to tell you one more thing. I want to tell you where my passion and conviction of the future of this country comes from. It's because I get the chance to see the American people, and I have over my lifetime seen people in this country, by the way, most of whom are struggling with one kind of challenge or another.
You look around, you see everybody, they look happy, and you think everybody's doing just fine and you're the only one with problems. But the truth is, most people that you see have some real challenges in their life of one kind or another. I understand that.
And I've seen that inside the heart of the American people, despite our challenges, is a conviction that this nation is the greatest nation in the history of the Earth. [applause] And we love this country and recognize the sacrifice that is made for this country.
I wonder how many people in this room have served in our armed forces or are doing so now. Would you raise your hand? [cheers and applause] Thank you, thank you, thank you for your service.
Some years ago I had the chance of helping to organize the Olympic Winter Games of 2002. This experience was one of the most meaningful to me, perhaps the most memorable for me. It was at the closing ceremonies. And the vice president of the United States came to watch those last events. And Vice President Cheney asked me to choose one athlete to come sit next to him in his box to represent all the American athletes, and I chose Derek Parra.
Derek is Hispanic American. He was born in Los Angeles. He was a rollerblader, all right? And his friends told him, look, you've got to pick up another sport because there's no medal in rollerblading. So he tries on ice skates. And he skates pretty darn well. As a matter of fact, he skates so well and works so hard he makes the U.S. speedskating team and comes to the Olympics.
And while he was there, he skates his heart out and gets a silver medal in the 5,000 meters and then a gold medal in the 1,500 meters. Fastest man in the world ice. [applause] And he's about 5'4" and strong, passionate.
I asked him to come in and sit with the vice president at the closing ceremonies. He came in, I stopped him and I said, Derek, what was the most meaningful experience in your Olympic games? And it wasn't the silver medal and it wasn't the gold medal. He said it was being honored to carry in the American flag that had flown above the World Trade Center on September 11th of 2001. [cheers and applause]
Derek was one of eight athletes chosen to carry in that flag that had been above the World Trade Center on that tragic day. The flag is about 8 feet by 12 feet. It's badly torn and burned, so you can't put it up a flagpole, you carry it in horizontally. And he said that they expected when it was announced as it was coming into the stadium that the audience would burst into tears; but instead, total silence and complete reverence.
So they carried the flag and he said, we stopped in front of the choir and they began performing the national anthem. And he said, Mitt, it was hard to hold onto my emotions as I was holding that flag and they were singing those words.
And then he said, the choir did something we hadn't expected. Now, I knew it was coming because I chose the version of the national anthem the choir sang, and I chose a version from the 1930s, arranged by Robert Shaw, where you repeat the last line and the sopranos go up an octave and there's much greater orchestration. "Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave." And he said this time as they sang it again, a gust of wind blew in the flag and lifted it in their hands. And he said it was as if all the spirits of those that had fought and died for American liberty had just blown in that flag. [applause]
We are a patriotic people. We recognize that our nation is an exceptional nation. We recognize the power and unique nature of the nation which was formed based upon the principle that God gave us our rights and that we have freedom as part of our life inheritance from this great nation.
This is who we are. The world needs the example of America. It needs a strong America.
I was in Poland a few weeks ago and saw Lech Walesa, a world hero. I came in to see him. He said, Mitt, you've come from America, you must be tired; you sit, I'll talk, you listen. [laughter] And so I did.
And then he said this: Where is American leadership? We need American leadership. Yours is the only superpower on the planet.
And then he'd look at what was happening in the Middle East and say, where is American leadership?
And then he'd go to another arena in the world, where is American leadership?
The world needs America to lead. Our families need America to lead. Our future needs America to lead.
If I'm the next president — when I'm the next president of the United States — [cheers and applause] — I will do everything in my power to keep America strong, strong in our homes, strong in our economy, strong in our military. We will lead! We will lead again! We'll have the jobs we need, the incomes we deserve, the respect we should receive around the world!
I love this country! I love Toledo, Ohio! [cheers and applause]
Thank you so very much! What a welcome! What a sendoff! Thank you!
[cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Westerville, Ohio

September 26, 2012

Thank you so much. Thank you. [cheers and applause] [inaudible] — Jack Nicklaus in just a second but wanted — wanted to get with your hometown hero. It's good to have Governor John Kasich here. Appreciate it. [cheers and applause] And of course, it's great to have Senator Rob Portman. You know, he — he debates me from now — time to time. [laughter] We — he's playing Barack Obama in these mock debates we have. I don't like it very much anymore, all right. [laughter] He keeps on beating me up, and I keep on going — [inaudible] — this guy is really something. You're lucky to have a guy so bright and so capable and so committed as your governor and as your senator. [cheers and applause]
But — but what you heard from the "Golden Bear," what you heard from the greatest athlete of the 20th century, the words that — that he spoke have touched my heart, and I'm sure they have touched your hearts as well.
He was moving and powerful. He's not a politician. He — he spoke from his heart, and what he said was about our country. When he said this election was not about him but about his kids and his grandkids, I knew just what he felt. That's what this campaign is all about.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.
MR. ROMNEY: He also said in that — those remarks that as — he said, you know, he — he learned that he had to know himself, learn himself, know himself. You heard that.
I thought, as he said that, I never imagined for a moment that Time magazine might name me the greatest athlete of the 20th century. [laughter] As a matter of fact, I didn't look at the Time magazine that week to see if I might have been named. I — [laughter] — I didn't have a great athletic career. And so when my — actually we have in my family a competition among our — our five boys and me, in the summertime. We call it the Romney Olympics, but it's hardly an Olympics. [laughter] And — and we — we play various sports. I typically come in sixth out of the six of us. [laughter]
So when I took the job to run the Olympics — yeah, sit down, guys, and those of you with chairs, go ahead and sit down. Oh, look at that. [laughter] That's a lot better, isn't it? [cheers and applause]
When — when I — when I got the job to help organize the Olympic Winter Games in 2002, I — I knew that it was a bit ironic for a guy with such little athletic ability myself to be able to be responsible for the largest athletic event in the world.
My boys also saw the irony in it. [laughter] My oldest son called when it was — when it showed up in the paper. They already knew about — that I'd taken the job, but my oldest son called and said, Dad, I saw the paper this morning, and I've talked to the brothers. We want you to know there's not a circumstance we could have conceived of that would put you on the front page of the sports section.
But there I was. [laughter and applause] So I know myself, and — and I know that the things that I've learned how to do are things that right now our country needs.
I know how to work with people who have different views and persuasions and bring them together to solve tough problems. It's something I've been able to do in part because I first grew up in a home where I saw my dad and my mom do that, but particularly dad. He — he ran a car company. I loved cars. And growing up in Detroit, I watched him take a company that was in real trouble. Some of you remember Ramblers, the jeep. This was American Motors. They made those products, yeah. [cheers and applause] And — and he helped turn the business around and make it successful. Then he went on to — to become the — the three-term governor of his state and worked with Republicans and Democrats and — to make his state more successful and create jobs. So I watched him do that.
Then I went into business myself. And for the 25 years or so I was in business, I learned a very simple lesson: You don't spend more money than you take in, or you go under. [cheers and applause]
And then — and then I was asked to come out and help organize the Olympic Winter Games. And I took those same skills I'd learned at home and — and that I've learned in business, and went out to the Olympics and was able to work with other people and bring that community together that had been in some respects pulled apart by the scandal associated with the games before I happened to be brought in there. And — and so we had successful games.
And then I was asked by a number of folks to come back and run for governor of my state and decided that was an important thing to do. Was able to work — my legislature, by the way, was slightly Democrat in Massachusetts; it was 87 percent Democrat, actually — [laughter] — 13 percent Republicans. (Scattered applause.) I realized I would get nothing done, nothing done unless I found a way to find some common ground with people across the aisle. We had different views on issues, but we shared some fundamental beliefs and principles. We wanted to help people.
We loved our country. We wanted to improve our schools. We wanted to keep taxes down — even Democrats in my state did — we wanted to keep taxes down because we didn't want jobs to leave, because when you raise taxes, you kill employment. So we worked together because of those common elements and were able to get our state back on track in important ways. We got employment down to 4.7 percent. Wouldn't that be nice if we — [cheers and applause] — (could have that ?).
I know myself well enough to know that I don't have all the ideas and all the best answers, that I need to work with other people and exchange ideas, and that when you do that, you can accomplish great things. Now, we have a president who the other day said something quite revealing. He said he can't change Washington from the inside, only from the outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance to be on the outside — [cheers and applause].
Every now and then I — I see protesters now and then at an event of mine. It's been a little while, but there have been some protesters, and usually they chant, "Four more years." And I — I scratch my head a bit when I hear that. I mean, do we really want four more years with 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No.
MR. ROMNEY: Do we want four more years where half the kids coming out of college can't find work, or college-level work?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do we want four more years where, every single year, the take-home pay goes down?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do we want four more years of trillion-dollar deficits?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah. I don't believe we can afford four more years like the last four years, and the reason I believe that after the debates and after the campaigns and after all the ads are over, the people of Ohio are going to say loud and clear on November 6th, we can't afford four more years; we must do better.
[cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [inaudible]
MR. ROMNEY: This — this election comes down to a very dramatic choice in my — oh, good, we have some "four more years" people who want to chat. Hi there. How you doing? This comes down to a very dramatic difference between two different courses for America. One of those —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [inaudible]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: You know, I know — I know there are some people who want four more years, but we don't want four more years like the last four years. [cheers and applause] This election, in my opinion, comes down to a very dramatic choice between two different courses for America. When it relates to the economy, the president's course is status quo. His slogan is — is "Forward." I think "forewarned" is a better term. [cheers and applause]
I mean, I don't know if you watched or read his speech at the Democrat convention, but he laid out a plan which was just like what he's done four years ago: another stimulus, bigger government. Instead of holding income taxes at the same level they've been, he's this time going to raise income taxes. That's a — that's a big change, I must admit, that he's going to add to his repertoire.
I don't think that's going to add more jobs in this country.
He also has another idea, which is instead of having consumers and markets choose the winners and losers among the various enterprises that are here, he likes to have government do that. [boos] Do you know he put $90 billion — $90 billion in the stimulus went to businesses that he thinks have the greatest prospects, like Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. [boos] He — he likes to pick winners and losers, or, as a friend said to me, no, he picks losers. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)
And there's one more element. It's not just the — more stimulus and more government and — and increasing income taxes. There's something else he wants to do that's the same as he's done in the past, and that is trillion-dollar deficits. That clock up there shows our national debt. When I began this campaign, it said it was 15 trillion (dollars). I mean, what's — what is a trillion? It's a thousand billions. It's this unthinkable amount. And he's added — we — he — when he came into office, there were just over $10 trillion in debt. Now there's over $16 trillion in debt. If he were re-elected, I can assure you it'll be almost $20 trillion of debt.
And by the way, those debts get passed on to our kids. It's not just bad for the economy. It's not just bad for our job creation. It will — in my opinion, it is immoral for us to pass on obligations like that to the next generation. [cheers and applause]
And by the way — and by the way, do you know what the interest bill is on that debt?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: A billion dollars.
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, the — the interest rate — the interest that you're paying on that debt every year is more than we pay for housing, for agriculture, for education and transportation combined.
That's how much the interest is.
And by the way, the interest rate is real low right now, artificially low. And the reason that is is because every time the government goes out to borrow money, instead of having to go out to the marketplace and have people bid the interest rates up, they just give the debt to the Federal Reserve, that takes it and puts it in their pocket, basically printing more money. So interest rates are real low.
What's going to happen when those interest rates go up? That bill's going to get bigger and bigger. It is crushing. That's the course this president has put us on. We're on the road to Europe; we're on the road to Greece. I will get us off that road and reinvigorate — [cheers and applause] — [inaudible].
There are five things — there are five things — there are five things I'm going to do, five things I'm going to do that are dramatically different than the past of status quo represented by this president. And in fact they're very different than anything that's been done before, because we face an economy that's different than the economy of the past. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world. Wasn't the case 10, 20 years ago. The world has changed.
Here are the things I'm going to do. Number one, I'm going to take advantage of our energy resources and get us energy independent — [cheers and applause].
Number two — number two, I'm going to get trade to work for us. We're going to open up more trade, where we can compete fairly, but we're going to crack down on China when they cheat. They've stolen our jobs. That's got to stop. [cheers and applause]
Number three — number three, I'm going to make sure we have the kind of training programs that give people the skills they need for the jobs of today. And I'm going to make sure in our schools we get our kids the education they need. Our schools are performing in the bottom third in the world. I'm going to put our kids and the teachers and the parents first, and the teachers' union behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four, with — with that kind of debt and that kind of interest payment that we're making, we're going to slowly but surely crush the ability of our economy to grow and create jobs. And so I'm going to do something Washington has talked about for years but not done. I'm going to cut federal spending. I'm going to cap it and get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
And number five — number five, I'm going to champion small business. [cheers and applause] Small business is where jobs — [inaudible].
And let me tell you how to do that. One — one, as Senator Portman said, we've got to reform our tax system.
Look, small businesses typically pay tax at the individual tax rate, and so our individual income taxes are ones I want to reform, make them simpler. I want to bring the rates down.
By the way, don't — don't be expecting a huge cut in taxes because I'm also going to lower deductions and exemptions. But by bringing rates down, we'll be able to let small businesses keep more of their money, so they can hire more people. [applause] My priority is jobs, and I'll make it happen. [cheers and applause]
You do those five things — you do those five things and this economy's going to come roaring back. If we don't do those five — five things, you're going to see — you're going to see four more years like the last four years, and I don't want that to happen. [boos]
I've been across this country. My heart aches for the people I've seen. I was yesterday with a — with a woman who was emotional, and she said, look, I've been out of work since May. She was in her 50s. She said, I don't see any prospects. Can you help me?
And I say, I'm going to do my very best to help you and — and millions of others like you — 23 million others like her.
There are so many in our country that are hurting right now. I want to help them. I know what it takes to get an economy going again and create jobs.
I know there are a lot of folks that have jobs that wonder how they can make ends meet till the end of the — end of the month, how they can put food on the table for their family because — there is a guy right there with that very question. It's that — look, with incomes going down every — every year, going down, down, down, and — and prices of electricity up and health insurance up and the — the — the cost of, well, gasoline having doubled, these are tough times, even for families with jobs.
I know what it takes to get this economy going again. I care about the people of America. And the difference between me and President Obama is I know what to do and I will do what it takes to get this economy going. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you, guys.
Let me mention something else. Let me mention something else. And that is, I talked about the economy and how we help people that are in trouble and how we could bring families back so they could have confidence in the future and make sure they know the ends can meet. They're tired of living paycheck to paycheck, and I want to change that.
But there is also another difference between myself and the president. and that is, perhaps — we stand back and look at the role of government, my view is the role of government is to encourage freedom, economic freedom, personal freedom. Our economy runs on freedom. [cheers and applause] I want government to be small and people to have more freedom. I realized — I realized, as Jack Nicholas just said, that you did build that. You built your lives, you built your enterprise as you help build the enterprises that create good jobs. [cheers and applause] I understand that — not government, but people — people.
[cheers and applause] And this president — this president has a very different view. He has a very different view. Not only does he think that government should choose winners and losers, as I mentioned before, he also thinks that government can do a better job than you in the way you live your life.
And "Obamacare" is point number one. [boos] It's the example number one where he wants to put bureaucrats between you and your doctor. [boos] He believes that — that government could — should tell you what kind of insurance you have to have. He believes that government should have a board of people that tell you what kind of care you can receive. [boos]
My view is we fight for freedom in this country. I do not want an intrusive, massive, larger debt-spending government that crushes the American dream. [cheers and applause]
And you guys, this matters. Look, this matters. This really matters. The choice we make is going to determine what kind of take-home pay people in America have. It's going to determine what kind of jobs we have. It's also going to determine whether our kids are confident and you're confident in your kids and in their future.
From the very beginning, America has always been defined by our belief that the future is brighter than the past. The majority of Americans don't believe that today. And if we stay on the road we're on, they will be right. It's unacceptable for America to continue this decline and have us as tired as we are of being tired.
I know what it takes to restore the greatness of America, to restore the promise for our kids and for our families today that are struggling. I also know what it takes to keep America strong.
Around the world — I was in Poland a few weeks ago, got the chance to meet with Lech Walesa, a hero. And — [cheers and applause] — as I came into the room, he said, you've come from America; you — you must be tired. You sit; I'll talk; you listen. [laughter]
I did. I sat down. And he began to speak.
And he said this again and again: Where's American leadership? We need American leadership. And then he'd talk about a region of the world and say, we need American leadership; where's American leadership?
I can commit to you this: With every ounce of my energy, when I'm president of the United States — when I am president of the United States — (extended cheers, applause) — I will strengthen America. [applause] I will strengthen our — [inaudible] — and our homes. I'll strengthen our economy to make sure that this economy can ignite our capacity to put people to work and to provide the resources we need to have the strongest military in the world! [cheers and applause] I will not (cut ?) our military. We will keep it strong. (Cheers and applause continuing.) [inaudible] — America. We're going to keep America strong! It's the hope of the earth.
I need your help on November 6th and every day till then. (Cheers and applause continuing.) We're going to win Ohio. [inaudible] [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Springfield Veterans for Romney Event in Springfield, Virginia

September 27, 2012

Thank you. Wow, what a group here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very much. What an honor to be here with you today. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Members of the American Legion, thank you. Thank you for your service. A real honor. Please, please.
Secretary Nicholson, thank you for that generous introduction — a Marine, a veteran of — of Vietnam and our conflict there. Appreciate his leadership in our country and his commitment to veterans. He was kind to be here today and to — to welcome me.
Thank you also to Colonel Leo Thorsness, Medal of Honor recipient. Colonel Thorsness, would you stand and be recognized here? [applause] We appreciate your being here today, sir. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]
You perhaps know Colonel Thorsness served in Vietnam, was a prisoner of war for six years there. He has — has led the Association of Medal of Honor Recipients and he has been kind enough to help organize many of them for me. Some 42 of them have joined my effort, endorsed my campaign. And I appreciate your service in this campaign, but even more, I appreciate your service for our — to our country and for our country.
I — in listening to Secretary Nicholson, I recalled some of those experiences of sending off our men and women in uniform to go off and — into Iraq and Afghanistan. There was one in particular that stands out, and this was a — a ceremony where quite a large number of men and women were on their way out. The families were behind them in the — in the bleachers, and the soldiers were seated in front. And their commanding officer spoke, and I spoke.
And at one point after we were finished a hand went up. And — and I recognized the person who raised his hand, and he said, I have a young lady that I'm in love with, and we haven't been married, and I'm going to go off to conflict. Could you marry us? [laughter] And I said, I don't see why not — [laughter] — and called the two of them forward, in front of the entire audience, brought them up and pronounced a wedding ceremony. I figured I was the governor; I could do whatever the heck I wanted to. [laughter]
And so — [chuckles] — so I married these two, and when I got back to the office, they said, you know, there's this thing called a marriage license. Did you know about that, Governor? [laughter] And — [chuckles] — we were able to take care of all those things and make sure that it was legitimate.
But what a — what a privilege to be able to be there and to send off men and women who love their country. I am — I'm privileged today in the presence of those who have served their nation, who, in the words of that wonderful hymn, "O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life." [applause]
I — I had also an honor last night. I was in Toledo, Ohio, and was leaving from Toledo to come here, and at the airport there was an Honor Flight returning to Toledo. And so, wanting to see those veterans, I parked myself over by their aircraft. And as they began coming down the — the — the plane — so it wasn't actually steps, but a kind of a gangway kind of thing. They came walking down, and I was able to shake hands with a number of them and say hello.
And — and then towards the end, the wheelchair brigade came along, because those that walked came out first, and then the wheelchairs later. And — and there were — the last couple were — were the most difficult, I — I think, physically to be able to leave the aircraft.
The — the second to the last individual stands out in my mind. He was brought down, quite elderly, a second world war veteran. And apparently, they had some difficulty just arranging the wheelchair of the aircraft and getting him in it and bringing it down this long gangway. And finally, he came down and I — I — I said hello to him and shook his hand.
And then he turned to — to go through this long alleyway that had been set up of flags and people who were there to recognize each of the veterans. But he stopped the person who was pushing them — pushing him in the wheelchair. And then he reached inside his coat and took out a flag —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Aww.
MR. ROMNEY: — and waved it. And we all applauded. [applause]
The love of country, the patriotism that's felt by those who served our country is something which inspires all of us to this day. And I appreciate the service of each of the men and women in this room who've served our nation in uniform and appreciate those who are serving our nation today and those who've served in the past all over this great country.
Now I'm concerned about the future. I'm concerned about America.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.
MR. ROMNEY: I'm concerned about the direction America's headed.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right.
MR. ROMNEY: The — the White House proposed a sequestration, kind of a gun-to-your-head opportunity, which is if Congress couldn't get the job done properly and the president couldn't lead them, why, they'd make devastating cuts to our military. It's a strange proposal in the first place. It's even stranger that it's being put in place. As Secretary Nicholson indicated, the impact will — will be immediate and significant right here in Virginia. A hundred and thirty-six thousand jobs will be lost in Virginia as a result of this move.
But when the secretary of defense said it would be devastating, he wasn't referring merely to the loss of jobs in Virginia or any other state, for that matter. He was thinking about our national security priorities and needs. The world is not a safe place. It remains dangerous.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right.
MR. ROMNEY: Look around the world. Look in — look in North Korea. They continue to develop and — and promote nuclear capability on their own part and to export it to others.
Syria — 20(,0000), 30,000 people killed in Syria.
Iran, closer and closer to having nuclear capability.
Egypt, now with a Muslim Brotherhood president.
Pakistan, highly tumultuous.
Afghanistan — our men and women still in Afghanistan. You — I mean, you keep going around the world. It is still a troubled and dangerous world, and the idea of cutting our military commitment by a trillion dollars over this decade is unthinkable and devastating. And when I become president of the United States, we will stop it. I will not cut our commitment to our military. [cheers and applause]
Now, you know — you know that these trillion-dollar cuts, both in budget and in sequestration, will have a significant impact on the veterans' system as well, as the secretary just indicated. We already have extraordinary backlogs, a million people backlogged for disability claims. A million people. I understand that they had so many claims piled up in one building here in Virginia that the building became structurally unsound and they had to get the people out of it. [laughter] I mean this — how can this be?
And we have huge numbers of our men and women that are returning from conflict that are seeking counseling, psychological counseling, and can't find that counseling within our system, and of course record numbers of suicides. This is a crisis. And in this kind of circumstance, given the challenges and threats around the world, given the need for employment here and given the need of our veterans, how in the world, as commander in chief, you could stand by as we shrink our military commitment financially is something I don't understand, and I will reverse it. [applause]
Now, I know there's waste in the military. I'm sure there's opportunity to economize and do a better job with the funds we have, and I expect to go after the Department of Defense and look in every single corner and see if we can't do things in a more efficient way than we've done them in the past. That being said, I want to take the resources we save and use them to make sure we care for our veterans in the way they deserve to be cared for, and that we also rebuild our technological capabilities, including our cyber capabilities, but also our ships and aircraft.
Do you realize we have fewer ships in the Navy than anytime since 1917? Now down to the 280s — we were told the minimum number of ships we needed was 313. And the ship number's going to keep coming down unless we recommit to rebuilding our modern Navy.
Our Air Force is older and smaller than anytime since 1947, when it was formed. This is unacceptable. And the idea of shrinking our active-duty personnel by 1(00,000) or 200,000 — I want to add a hundred thousand to active-duty personnel. [applause] I happen to subscribe to Ronald Reagan's maxim that peace comes through strength. I want to have a military that's so strong, no one wants to test it — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
And there's a long-term threat to our military capability and to our national security, and it relates to something that fuels and builds our military, and that's our economy. You have to have a strong economy in order to build a strong military. Russia tried for a while — the old Soviet Union tried for a while to maintain a grade A, if you will, military, but they had a grade B economy, and they couldn't keep up. They finally had to — well, they collapsed. We have to have a strong economy.
Right now Russia's economy is growing at about 4 percent per year. That's their GDP growth. Ours was just revised last quarter down to 1.3 percent per year, about a quarter or a fifth the rate of — of Russia's. This is — this is a real challenge for us. And this is not just one quarter. This has been going on now for years. China's growing much faster than we. Russia's growing faster than we. Our economy needs to be reinvigorated. And the president has laid out his plan.
It's a continuation of the old plan. [boos] We can't afford four more years of the last four years. [boos] All right? [applause] It — his plan cuts the military. His plan asks for another stimulus. How'd that last one work, by the way? [laughter] His plan calls for government being able to invest in winners and losers or, in their case, losers. And — [laughter] — and his plan also calls for trillion-dollar deficits. Recognize trillion-dollar deficits — that debt is owned by somebody. Someone holds that. That puts America in a position of — of economic risk, fiscal risk. Do you know how much money is spent on interest every year?
By the way, interest rates are real low. And one of the reasons they're so low is that as the government goes out to get — to borrow money, the Federal Reserve takes it and just puts it in their pockets. So we're — in effect, we're manufacturing money. So we keep the interest rates real low. Even with the interest rates real low, we spend more on interest as taxpayers, paying the government debt, than we spend on housing, agriculture, education and transportation combined. It's huge. And it's going to get a lot bigger, particularly if every year we add another trillion dollars to the deficit.
This is a — this is an extraordinary challenge that faces America's economy and America's military long term and our foreign policy. I've heard time and again from former members or — excuse me — from former secretaries of state that our diplomatic power and our military power flows from our economic power.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right.
MR. ROMNEY: With our economy struggling, that is a long-term trend which is unacceptable to America.
Now I have a very different approach. I have five things I'm going to do to get this economy going. And they're going to create 12 million jobs. I'm not going to be cutting jobs from Virginia, I'm going to be adding jobs to Virginia. [cheers and applause]
So we're going to — and those — those things include, number one, taking advantage of our energy resources — our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables — [cheers and applause] — getting North America energy independent. That will keep our gasoline prices more moderate. It will also provide us with a lot of jobs in the energy sector and in manufacturing because when energy is less expensive, manufacturing will come home. That's number one.
Number two, I like trade. I want to make sure that we open up new markets for us to trade and sell our goods into around the world. But when nations cheat in trade — and China has cheated — I will finally do something the president has not been willing to do, which is call them on the carpet for it and label them currency manipulators. [applause] That's number two.
First, energy; second, trade. Number three, we got to make sure that our people have the skills they need to succeed, so training programs for our adults have to be updated and modernized and linked with what employers need.
And we also have to make sure our schools are giving our kids the skills they need. It's unacceptable, in my view, for the nation that invented public education to have kids performing now in the bottom third or bottom quartile of the world. That can't happen. And I know what we have to do. We have to make sure we put the interest of the kids and the parents and the teachers first, and the teachers' union is going to have to go behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four, you know, we can't keep on spending and borrowing, spending more than we have. We keep doing that year after year after year, you put America on track to becoming Greece or Italy or Spain. We're becoming weaker and weaker, fundamentally, economically. And nations around the world are looking and seeing what we're doing, surprised that we're not willing to take action.
If I become president, I will make it my priority in my first hundred days to take action to get America on track to getting a balanced budget. We've got to do it. [cheers and applause]
And number five, number five, we have to champion small business. We have to make it easier for small businesses to grow and thrive. [cheers and applause] That's where about — about two-thirds of the jobs created in America over the last 15 years were created by small business. I want small businesses to grow and — and be able to hire more people and, by the way, to pay higher wages.
Do you realize over the last four years the median income in America has dropped every single year? So not only are there 23 million people struggling to find a good job and half our college kids not able to find work or work consistent with a college degree, but incomes are going down. At the same time, food prices are up; electric prices are up; gasoline prices have doubled. These are tough times for the American people. And the answer to help the American people is to get small business growing again, hiring people again, raising wages again. [cheers and applause] I know how to do it. We're going to do that.
Now, and as the secretary said, my plans include pro-growth tax policies, regulatory policies that encourage small business. And by the way, I want to take this big cloud off of small business that's keeping about three-quarters of them from hiring people, and that is I got to get rid of "Obamacare" and replace it with something that works. [cheers and applause]
So two — two very different paths. One is the path the president's proposed, which is the status quo. His is the path of — well, he calls it "Forward." I call it "forewarned," all right? [laughter] All right? It is the same series of policies he's put in place over the last four years, and they have not worked.
And — and if you don't — don't believe me, why, look at the price of gasoline, and — and — and look at the — the jobs in your community and the — the members of your family that are struggling for good work. If you don't believe me, look at the numbers that just came out and the growth of our economy: 1.3 percent versus Russia at 4 percent? China at 7 (percent) to 8 percent? We're at 1.3 percent.
This is — this is unacceptable. It is not working. I know what it takes to get us working. He's put us on a road to Europe. Europe doesn't work in Europe, all right? [laughter] I want to get us back to being America, where people here come here, build enterprises here, we fulfill American dreams and we keep the hope alive in America. [applause]
And this matters. You know this matters. This counts. It counts for the 23 million people who are struggling to get a job or get a better job today. It counts for the young people coming out of school hoping to get a job when they come out of school, and one that will help them pay back their student loans. It counts for the coming generations.
We have always been a nation that has recognized that the future is brighter than the past. Today we wonder whether that's true, but the majority of Americans don't think that's the case. This matters.
And there's one more sense in which it matters, and it's what I began with, and that is our military capability, our ability to defend our liberty and the liberty of our friends around the world with whom we trade and whose prosperity is linked with our prosperity.
I was — I was in Poland a few weeks ago, and I got the chance — chance to meet Lech Walesa, also a hero. And — [applause] — I came in and he said, Mr. Romney, you've just come from the United States. He said, you must be tired. You sit. I'll talk. You listen. [laughter] And so I did. And — and then he said this. For about 15 minutes he said this and repeated it again and again: Where's American leadership? We need American leadership. Where's American leadership? And then he'd talk about a — a region of the world and what was happening in that region, and then he'd say, where's American leadership? And then he'd go to another region, talk about the challenges there. Where's American leadership?
Look, the world has always looked to us as that shining city on a hill, but that light looks a little dimmer in some people's minds these days, in part because we haven't been willing to deal with the challenges we have. We keep kicking them down the road and hoping that — that somehow somebody else will deal with it.
Well, that time is now ours. This is the greatest generation, that left us this nation so prosperous and so free. Now it's our turn. They've held the torch aloft for the whole world to see, a torch of freedom and opportunity and hope. But they're getting fewer and further between, the greatest generation. They can't hold the torch quite as high as they used to. And so it's our turn to grab that torch and to hold it aloft for the world to see.
And if I become president — no, when I become president, as I say — [cheers and applause] — we're going to do what has to do — what we have to do. We're going to do what we have to do to get that torch high and very, very bright indeed. We're going to make sure and restore the principles this nation was built upon of freedom and opportunity. We're going to make sure and restore our economy and put people back to work, get rising take-home pay again, and we're going to make sure we have a military that is second to none.
I will do those things. I look forward to being the commander in chief, to being able to keep this nation strong. I make that commitment to you. [applause] I need your help. We've got to win in Virginia. I need your help to get the veterans here. We'll keep America the hope of the earth.
Thank you so very much. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Wayne, Pennsylvania

September 28, 2012

Thank you. Wow. What a welcome. Thank you. Wow. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Wow. [cheers and applause] You know, that is — that is one heck of a welcome, I got to tell you, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] That's amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you. Now, I — I have to tell you, if anybody's watching this on TV, they're going to be very amazed, and they're going to try and understand how it is so much noise is coming from a group that's hardly moving. I — that — [cheers] — so I — [chuckles] — it is an honor to be with you and to be here with these cadets and to be at this extraordinary place that so many presidents past have visited and, well, a president future is visiting today. [cheers and applause]
I'm — I'm honored to have been introduced by a great United States senator. They don't come better than your senator, Pat Toomey. What a great guy. Thank you, Pat. [cheers and applause]
Congressman Jim Gerlach is here — appreciate his support — his support — and Tom Smith, who's going to become the next U.S. senator that'll join Pat Toomey. [cheers and applause] Appreciate him being here.
Lieutenant Governor Cawley is here. I appreciate his support.
And thank you also to the president of this institution, the — Colonel James Doyle. Appreciate his willingness to open up this room for all of us to come and meet. [applause] It looks like we've — we've filled it to overflowing, as they say. [cheers and applause] Appreciate his hospitality.
And any place — any place that can — that create the — the character of individuals that have been represented by this institution, which have included Norman Schwarzkopf, ass well as Larry Fitzgerald, we appreciate them — [applause] — and acknowledge the accomplishment of this institution.
I appreciate the young and young women who are seated behind me. These are extraordinary people. I appreciate the fact that they're going to be heading off in life, some looking, I imagine, to a career in the military, some instead going on to college, and some actually in college as well, and some going to — on to four-year colleges and coming out looking for jobs.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!
MR. ROMNEY: And I have to tell you that I don't know how a single person who goes to this institution could consider voting for the incumbent for president. And I say that for this reason. If they want to go in the military, why, he's planning on cutting our military by about a trillion dollars over the next decade. [boos] And if they go — want to go on to either get a job directly or go on to a four-year college and — and come out with a degree, why, you know that 50 percent of kids coming out of college today can't find a job or a college-level job. So on both fronts, this president's policies have not worked for the young people of America.
And one more thing, and that is not only will they have a hard time finding a job, given the economy this president's produced, and not only will they have a military that is becoming devastated in — in the words of the secretary of defense, devastated by these defense cuts; they'll also have hundreds of — well, thousands and thousands of dollars of debt on their shoulders that were amassed by this administration because the president adds about a trillion dollars a year to the national debt.
So these guys, if they keep voting — if anybody who's a young person going to college today keeps voting for the president, why, they get more debt, fewer jobs and a smaller military. I represent a very different course. I'll make sure that the young people of today have great jobs tomorrow and have a bright and prosperous future. That's the difference between us. [cheers and applause]
Now, I'm — it's been a — it's been a bit of a — a coincidence of events over the last few days, but I'm honored to be one more time today in a — in a place that honors the service of our men and women in uniform. I was yesterday in — [cheers and applause] — I was in Springfield — Springfield, Virginia, yesterday and had the chance to be with Colonel Leo Thorsness, who was the recipient of the Medal of Honor. He served our nation in Vietnam, was in a prisoner of war camp for six years. He is an extraordinary leader who helped bring together, for me, some 43 Medal of Honor recipients to support my campaign. Quite a hero. I appreciate him — [cheers and applause] — and appreciated the other soldiers I saw there.
And the — the night before, I was in Toledo, Ohio. And — and as my — my plane was leaving to go to Washington, D.C., and Virginia, there was another plane coming in. It was an honor flight bringing home our veterans who had served in the second world war and the Korean War. They had been in Washington, D.C., and there they had been able to see the memorials in honor of their — their service. And as they came off the plane, one by one, I got the chance to shake their hands and express my appreciation for their service.
As they go from me back into the building that was going to have a celebration in their honor, they had to walk through a long pathway where, on each side, men and women holding American flags were standing, cheering on these veterans as they — as they walked by.
At the end of the — the long trail of veterans came those that were on wheelchairs. And the last men and women that came down were brought down a long ramp on their wheelchair. The second to the last individual was a second world war veteran, pretty — pretty senior. And when he came down, I shook his hand. And — and then they began to wheel him through this long alley of — of flags. And he stopped the person. As I recall, it was a young woman. He stopped her for a moment, said, wait a second, and — and then he reached in, with some difficulty, and then pulled out a little American flag and began waving that flag.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Aww! [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: We are a — we're a nation of patriots. We love this country. We recognize that the principles upon which this country was founded, that those principles distinguish us as an exceptional nation. We recognize that when the founders said that our rights came not from the king, not from government but from God, that changed everything. [cheers and applause]
One of our — one of our national hymns says it well, in my view: O beautiful, for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. For all of you who've served in our military, would you please raise your hand? And those that are also in the military today, please raise your hand and be recognized. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [applause]
Now, about a year ago I had the opportunity to speak at the citadel in South Carolina where also I know their military academy was training young people to consider a career in the military. And just like this group of cadets behind me, they didn't move when I told my jokes, so I didn't — [laughter] — I learned not to worry about that. But — but at that address that I gave there, I — I said a number of things that I thought were important.
One was that this next century, the one we're now in, must be an American century. And by that I mean that America must continue to lead the free world, and the free world must continue to lead the entire world. There are other models out there, and there are people around the world wondering, should we follow America and the model of freedom with opportunity that's presented by economic freedom and personal freedom and economic freedom? Or should we instead follow the model of a nation like China, for instance, whose economy is growing? Do you understand that China's economy is growing at about 7 (percent) or 8 percent, Russia's economy is growing at 4 percent, and our economy is growing at 1.3 percent? [boos] Yeah.
We're in a very different road than what I think the people of the world expected from the United States of America. And if I'm elected president of this country, I will get us back on a road of growth and prosperity and strength. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Now, as — as we've seen over the last year, the world needs American leadership. (Murmurs of approval.) I think we — we look around and we say, why is it we're at the mercy of events? Why are we not shaping events? [cheers] And — and — and the other day — I mean, the other day the president said that, you know, he has a vision for what's going to happen in the Middle East, but that there are going to be bumps in the road along the way. [boos]
You know, I — I don't consider 20(,000) or 30,000 people dying in Syria just a bump in the road or — or — or a Muslim Brotherhood president in — in Egypt a bump in the road. I don't consider the — the killing of our diplomats in — in Libya as a bump in the road. And I sure as heck don't consider Iran becoming nuclear a bump in the road. We need someone who recognizes the seriousness of what's ahead and is willing to lead. [cheers and applause]
The administration — the administration has — has characterized their — their foreign policy as leading from behind. I call that following. [laughter] It's time for America to lead, and we will lead again. [cheers and applause]
Now it's difficult — it's difficult to lead the world if we have an economy that's not thriving and putting people to work. It's difficult to lead the world when you have a president deciding to cut our military commitment by a trillion dollars — that's a thousand billion dollars — over the next decade. The secretary of defense, as I said, has called that a devastating series of cuts to our military. Do you realize that our Navy is older and — excuse me — it is smaller — our Navy is smaller in terms of the number of ships at any time since 1917.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Gasping.)
MR. ROMNEY: And our — our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since it was founded, in 1947, and yet we continue to take funding out of our military. This idea of a trillion dollars in cuts to our military is wrong. When I'm elected president of the United States, we'll restore our military. [cheers and applause] We will not cut our military commitment. [cheers and applause]
And let me — let me — let me note, not coincidentally, that someone has calculated how many jobs will be lost in Pennsylvania if those trillion dollars in cuts go through; it's 39,000 jobs. We can't afford that. So I — we recognize the consequence of what the president's doing is severe for the people in Pennsylvania, it's severe for the entire nation, and in fact, because of the world's demand for American leadership, it's severe for the entire world.
I know what it takes to get this country going again. The president — [cheers and applause] — the president wants to go down the same path he's been on for the last four years. He wants to keep the status quo. I don't think we can afford four more years like the last four years.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: The president calls his campaign slogan "Forward." I call it "forewarned," all right? We know where it heads; we don't want to go there. [cheers and applause]
The president thinks we need another stimulus. How did that last stimulus work out? Not so well.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: The president wants to grow government. I think government should be smaller, not bigger. I don't want it to take more from us. [cheers and applause]
There's one — there's one new agenda item the president has. Of course, he raised taxes with "Obamacare," but he's got another tax in mind. He wants to raise the income tax. I don't want to raise taxes on the American people, not when our economy's in the kind of trouble it's in. I will not raise taxes on middle-income Americans. [cheers and applause]
And, of course — and of course the president wants to continue to be able to take your tax dollars and — he calls it invest it — invest it where he thinks it will do best, all right? He likes to pick winners and losers, although his experience is mostly picking losers.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah.
MR. ROMNEY: Look, he takes your money and puts it into Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and — and Ener1 and — one after the other, these things.
Look, it is not government that guides our economy. Our economy does not run because we have bureaucrats telling us what to invest in or what jobs to have. [cheers and applause] What our economy runs on is free people pursuing their dreams. That's what makes America works. [cheers and applause]
And I've got a plan. I've got a — a plan to help free people pursue their dreams and get this economy going. And the good news is this: It'll create 12 million jobs putting Americans back to work again. And by the way, as we have those 12 million jobs created, you're going to find competition among employers trying to hire the best people. And so wages are going to go up again. Take-home pay is going to go up again. [cheers and applause]
We've had — we've had four years — we've had four years where take-home pay goes down. That's the wrong way. We can't continue — did you see that median income in America has dropped by some $4,000 over the last four years? Median income is about $50,000 bucks. You drop that by $4,000, thinks — think what that does to American families. Think how difficult it is for them to be able to put food on the table at the end of the week. This is just not right. The president's policies have not worked. My policies to create 12 million jobs will bring more take-home pay, more hope and more prosperity for every family in America. [cheers and applause]
And there are five things — there are five things that I'll do. Number one — to get this economy going, five steps — number one: Take advantage of our energy, our coal, our oil, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. [cheers and applause] And — and by the way, that's not just a slogan. I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to double the number of permits and licenses we give for drilling on federal land and federal waters. [cheers and applause]
I'm going to make sure we have regulations that keep our air and our water clean, but I'm not going to have regulators keep us from being able to use our coal. It's a resource we must be able to continue to use. [cheers and applause]
And we're going to get that pipeline from Canada if I have to build it myself. [cheers and applause]
Now number two, I want trade to work for us. I want trade to work for us. I want to open up new markets for us to have trade and to sell our goods. They often create paying — higher-paying jobs than even the domestic jobs. So I want more trade for us.
But when nations cheat like China has cheated, I will stop it. We've got to do that. [cheers and applause]
Number three — number three, our workers need the skills to succeed. I want training programs that do that. We have 47 different federal training programs, eight different agencies. Think of the overhead, the redundancy, the ineffectiveness. I want to take that money that's being spent by Washington, bundle it up and send it back to Pennsylvania and say, you create your own programs — [cheers and applause] — that work best for your own people.
And I want our kids — I want our kids in public schools to be able to get the very best education, the kind of education that these men and women have fought to get themselves. I want them to have terrific schools that are the best in the world. We're not there today. It's time for us to put our kids and their parents and the teachers first and put the union behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four, to create good jobs, we have to make sure that entrepreneurs know and that businesses large and small know that we're not on the road to Greece, and therefore I will cut federal spending, I'll cap it and finally get us on track to a balanced budget.
[cheers and applause]
And number five, number five, I want to champion small business. I want small business to have a boost from America. [cheers] I want to keep — I want to keep our taxes down on small business. I want regulations to be updated and as small as they can be for small business.
And by the way, I want to take that big cloud off of the small-business world that's hanging over them. Three-quarters of them say they don't want to hire more people because of this cloud. And that cloud is "Obamacare." We're going to repeal it and replace it. [cheers and applause]
America — America has a very — a very dramatic choice it can make. We can keep going down the same road we're on, and if we go down the road we're on, we're headed for a weaker and weaker economy, with fewer people being able to get jobs than the people — that really need them. We're going to see kids coming out of school not able to get the jobs they need. That's the path we're on. That's the path of the status quo the president's fighting for. We do not want four more years of where we've been.
I represent a very different path. I will restore America's strength, I'll put America back to work, and I'll keep our military so strong no one would ever think of testing America's military might. [cheers and applause]
Now, this matters. I know you're here because you know this matters. You're not here just to say hi to me. I'm a nice guy, but that's not why you're here. [laughter] You're not here just because you're Republicans or conservative, even though most of you are. I know why you're here. You're concerned about America.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes!
MR. ROMNEY: I'm — I'm concerned about America. I'm concerned about the path this president's put America on. I know where it leads. It leads to where Greece and Italy and Spain are. That's a road we've got to get off of as fast as we can. I'm going to get this country on a very different road. [cheers and applause]
It matters for the 23 million Americans that are fighting to get a better job. It — it matters for the young people coming along that wonder whether they're going to get stuck with our bills and no jobs at the end of their education.
It also matters for the world. I was with Lech Walesa a number of weeks ago, a great hero in Poland, and — [cheers and applause] — and I came in to see him. He said, you must be tired, you came from America. You sit, I talk, you listen. And — [laughter] — so I sat, and — and he began to speak. And he said this time and again: Where is American leadership? The world needs American leadership. You're the only superpower on the planet. Where is your leadership? And then he'd talk about the Middle East or some other corner of the world and then repeat again, where is American leadership?
Look, we can't be leading from behind. America must lead, and that begins with strong homes and values and commitment to our values. (Scattered cheers.) It — it — it includes a strong economy, a strong economy that puts us to work and that can fuel a military that's so strong the world looks at it with increasing — increasing respect.
I will strengthen America. We will make sure America leads in our homes, in our economy and in our military. I need something from you. That's my commitment to you. I need you to go out and find someone who voted for Barack Obama and get him to vote for me, all right? [cheers and applause]
So — you know what, I've got a little secret here, and that is that the Obama campaign thinks that Pennsylvania is in their pocket. They don't even worry about it. [boos]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We'll win!
MR. ROMNEY: And you're right, and they're wrong. We're going to win Pennsylvania, and we're going to take the White House. [cheers and applause] Thank you so very much. Thank you. (Sustained cheers, applause.)

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Denver, Colorado

October 1, 2012

Wow, thank you so much. Thank you. What an honor! What an honor! What a welcome! What a Colorado welcome. Thank you so much. [applause] And what an honor to be introduced by none other than John Elway. What an extraordinary man. [applause] And thank you too for Lorrie Morgan beginning this entire event here with the National Anthem and her music. Lorrie, thank you so much for all of your help. It was wonderful. Thank you. [applause]
Now, I understand we also have Todd Helton here, first baseman with the Rockies. [applause] You guys have some real teams here, don't you? No question about that. And of course, you have your congressman, Cory Gardner, here who's running for reelection. Make sure and get him in office again. [applause] And thank you to your great former governor, Bill Owens, a great friend, a great man, a great Coloradan. [applause]
Now, I just had the opportunity just a few moments ago. I don't know whether you got a chance to meet her, whether you got to see Dee Dee Parrish. Did you see Dee Dee Parrish? [applause] She must be up there somewhere. Dee Dee — Dee Dee, I just met. She's a lovely woman. She flew in the Second World War. She flew B-26s and she's here. I want to recognize our military champions. She received the Congressional Gold Medal for her service in our military. We're surrounded by the sights of those that stand up for our freedom. This is a great place to be, here at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. When I was a boy, my mom and dad used to read to me from a book called "Men to Match My Mountains."
Perhaps we should change the title to "Men and Women to Match My Mountains" because right here, men and women have matched the mountains of Colorado and they've matched the mountains in aircraft like that. This is the home, of course, of the Air Force Academy. [applause] This is the home of NORAD that helps keep our skies safe. This is — [applause] — this is the home of Focus on the Family, which is — [applause] — committed to preserving the foundation of America. This is home to great institutions of higher learning.
It's also home to a pretty darn good football team. [applause] And one more thing, I think this is going to be the home of the place that elects the next president of the United States. [applause] Now, you know that you're going to get some visitors this week. The president will be here. I'll be here. We're going to have a debate. And there's a lot of interest surrounding the debate. And people want to know who's going to win, who's going to score the punches and who's going to make the biggest difference and the arguments they make and there's going to be all the scoring of winning and losing.
And you know, in my view it's not so much winning and losing or even the people themselves — the president and myself. It's about something bigger than that. These debates are an opportunity for each of us to describe the pathway forward for America that we would choose. And the American people are going to have to make their choice as to what kind of America they want. And so I look forward to these debates. I'm delighted that we're going to have three debates.
It'll be a conversation with the American people that will span almost an entire month. We'll get to describe our respective views. And I believe the people of Colorado will choose a better way forward for our country. We can't afford four more years like the last four years. [applause] Now, the president's pathway is not something which is unknown to us. We've seen the pathway he's proposed over the last four years. As a matter of fact, we heard his speech not terribly far from here about four years ago about where he would take the country.
And he's fought for some of the things he described there — a bigger government, taxing our people more and more. He believes in picking —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: He believes in picking winners and losers. He put money in a whole mess of companies, about $90 billion intro green energy companies like Solyndra and Tesla and Fisker.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: A friend of mine said he doesn't just like picking winners and losers. He likes picking losers. [applause] His pathway is a path that would dramatically shrink our military. His budget calls for hundreds of billions of military cuts and then on top of that was this sequestration deal that puts even more cuts on top of that. That will mean thousands of jobs lost here. It'll mean millions of jobs ultimately lost across our great nation. I do not believe in shrinking our military. I believe it must be second to none in the world. [applause]
We know where the president's pathway leads because we're on it. We've seen it for four years. We've seen the number of people on food stamps go from 32 million to 47 million, 50 million more people having fallen into poverty and needing food stamps, 1 out of 6 Americans now in poverty, 23 million Americans looking for a job, 23 million. We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. And what does the president have to say to all this? He says forward.
I think forewarned is a better term. [applause] We listened to the president at his convention just a few weeks ago. No new ideas. He's out of ideas. He's out of excuses. And on November 6th, you're going to put him out of office. [applause] Now, Paul Ryan and I, we have a different path we'd put America on. There are five things we'll do to strengthen our economy and create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. Do you realize over the last four years, every year you've seen the median income in America come down?
Income is down some $4,300 a family. And with the median income of about $50,000, that means things are really tough for the American people. The middle class squeeze has been unbearable. Gasoline price is way up. Food price is up. Electricity price is up. Health insurance cost is up. The American middle class is struggling under this president and my plan and Paul Ryan's plan to create five steps to get this economy going will help middle income Americans have a brighter future and will lift people out of poverty.
And let me tell you what those steps are. Number one, we're going to fully take advantage of our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear, our renewables. [applause] The president has cut in half the number of permits and licenses on federal land. I'll double that. I'm going to make sure we get the resources in Alaska, we finally get that energy here. And by the way, I'm going to get that pipeline from Canada if I have to build it myself. [applause] Number one is energy and that creates about 3-1/2 to 4 million new jobs, not just in the energy sector but also in manufacturing because it will come back here with low cost, plentiful energy. That's number one.
Number two, I like trade with other nations. We can compete with anyone in the world. I want to open up more markets for trade.
The same time that people cheat like China has cheated on — China has cheated on trade, I will crack down on them. we will not allow China to steal our jobs unfairly. [applause] Number three — number three, I want to make sure our workers are getting the skills they need and training programs that work for them. right now, we have 47 different government — federal government training programs, 47.
They report to eight different agencies. Think of all the overhead, all the waste, all the duplication. I want to take all that money and give Colorado its fair share and say you create the program that works best for your own people. Let's let Colorado solve Colorado's people problems. [applause] And making sure our people have the skills compete, I not only want to help our people that are in the workforce today. I want to make sure our kids are getting the education they need. And for that to happen, it's time for us to fully recognize that we have to put our kids and the parents and the teachers first and the teachers union behind. [applause]
Number four — number four, to create jobs requires entrepreneurs to take the risk of opening a business. Small businesses have to grow and thrive. And it also takes big companies to decide to build a new facility in America and to hire more people. For those things to happen, they've got to be convinced that America is not on the road to Greece because if they think America is going to have the kind of economic circumstances that Greece now has, they're not going to risk their life savings to start a business.
And so, what I'm going to do is this. I'm going to cut federal spending. I'm going to cap it as a percentage of the economy and finally get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause] And there's one more. And there's one more. And that's — and that's this. We have to champion small business. We have to make it easier for small businesses. [applause] Now, the president — the president has a plan for small business. On a million small businesses, he's planning on raising their taxes from 35 percent to 40 percent.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: That will kill jobs. That will kill jobs. The National Federation of Independent Businesses asked Ernst & Young to look and see what impact that will have on America. And the answer is that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't want to lose jobs. I have a plan, by the way, that adds 7 million jobs. My tax plan does this. It brings down the tax rate. It brings down deductions and credits for high income people, brings down that tax rate so that small businesses can afford to hire more people.
My priority is jobs. Jobs is job one under my administration. We're going to get America working again by helping small business. [applause] And let me mention — let me mention one other thing. If the president succeeds in something he's pushing very hard, which is something known as card check — and for those of you not familiar with it, it's this. It says we're going to take away from the American worker the right to vote by secret ballot as to whether or not they want to have a union.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: And on that basis — on that basis, a guy or a gal could be in their back yard barbecuing with their kids and some people could come up and say, here, sign this statement. We want you to vote where we can watch you vote. In a setting like that, you're going to see coercion and you're going to see small businesses overtaken by unions. And I'll tell you this. Entrepreneurs aren't going to want to start a business if that's the case.
If card check goes in place, it will kill America's entrepreneurial economy. What the president is doing is bowing to the demands of big labor, to his big contributors. It's wrong. It would kill our economy. I'll stop that in its track. We must have people have the right to vote by secret ballot. [applause]
Those five things — those five things I've described will create 12 million jobs. And as those jobs are created, there will be more competition for workers. And as businesses compete for workers, they're going to have to drive their wages up and their benefits up. So you're going to see rising incomes again. Look, these years we've experienced for the last four years we don't have to experience for the next four years. This president is taking us on path that's not working.
He's making us more and more like Europe. I don't want to be like Europe. Europe doesn't work in Europe.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: I want to restore the principles that made America the nation we are. We are an exceptional nation. [applause] The exceptional — I believe the exceptional nature of this country was established when the Founders wrote the Declaration of Independence with these insights. First, that our rights were given to us not by government but by the Creator. [applause] And among those rights — life and liberty. That's why we have a strong military, to protect our lives and to secure our liberty. Life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the ability in America of people to pursue their dreams.
And every now and then, someone has a great idea. That's their dream and they build an enterprise and it employs hundreds, thousands of people. I see it day in and day out as I see the entrepreneurs of America. It's what makes our economy go. A bigger and bigger government taking more and more, demanding more and more, more and more intrusive in our lives will not make America stronger. Instead, restoring freedom and opportunity will get America to work again and I'll do it. [applause]
And it's important. This is important. This election is not just about four years. It's about the course for America over decades. We're going to make a choice now which is going to affect the lives of our kids and theirs. it's important. People need to pay attention to the path that we're on and ask do we really want to keep going down that path or can we instead —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: Or can we instead take a path that'll get us working again, restore the principles that made America the hope and the passionate leader and protector of freedom that it's always been. I was in Poland a few weeks ago and I got the chance to meet a world hero, Lech Walesa. [applause]
And he was the guy that stood up to the Soviet Union from the gates of the Gdansk shipyard. And I came in to see him and he looked at me and said, you've come from America. You must be tired. You sit. I'll talk. You listen. [laughter] And so I sat. And then he said this repeatedly: where is American leadership. We need American leadership. America's the only nation on Earth that's a superpower. We need American leadership. [applause] For the last four years, we've had a foreign policy led by a president who believes the strength of his personality is going to get people to do the right things. Well, we've seen fires burning in United States embassies around the world. We need the strength of American military, America's economy and America's principles if we're going to keep this world more safe and preserve liberty. [applause]
The greatest thing about this campaign for me personally has been meeting the people of this great country. I love America. I love the beauty of its rocks and rills and templed hills. But a lot more than that, I love the beauty of the American soul. The heart and passion of the American people is alive and well. We're a patriotic people. We love our country. The fact that you're here tonight, that you care about elections shows how much we care in America. [applause]
The world looks to us, as Lech Walesa said. It looks to America to lead with our values, with our principles, with an economy that's strong and growing. Our economy last quarter, did you see that? It showed that this year our economy's growing more slowly than the year before and the year before that was faster still. This economy is not in recovery. We're not seeing a real recovery. The president's policies have not worked. He doesn't get that. He doesn't understand that. We must get America growing again with a strong economy to support a strong military and strong homes to support both of those.
This is a critical time for America. We've had the benefit of the greatest generation that's held aloft a torch for us to see and for the world to see, a torch of freedom and opportunity. But the members of the greatest generation are not as few — or excuse me, are not as many as they used to be and they're not as strong as they used to be. They can't hold that torch as high. It's our turn. We've got to grasp that torch and hold it aloft for the world to see. [applause]
And I make — I make this commitment to you. If I'm elected — when I'm elected president of the United States — [applause] — I will do everything in my power to keep America strong, to strengthen our values and our homes, to strengthen our commitment to our principles, our founding principles. I'll do everything in my power to get this economy growing again, lifting all people, helping all people in this country. And I'll make sure our military is second to none, so strong no one would ever think to test America's military might. [applause]
And I have a request of you. That's my commitment to you. Your commitment to me is this. I'd like you to go out and find one person who voted for Barack Obama, or maybe two or three or four or five, and convince them to come join our team. I need you to go out and find people and say, you know what, it's not working. We need someone who'll get this America going again. I will with your help. We're taking back America. We're going to get it strong again. We're going to strengthen America from the very foundation. I love this country. I love you. Thank you for your help! Let's win this one for America! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks with Paul Ryan at a Campaign Event in Fishersville, Virginia

October 4, 2012

RYAN: Hey, everybody! Thank you, Fishersville! Man, wow! Look at you! [applause] Look at this! Awesome! Man, thank you, Fishersville. Thank you, Virginia. Thank you for making Mitt Romney the next president of the United States of America. [applause]
Wow. You know, Chris Cox and I have been friends for a long time. I've been subscribing to American Rifleman and American Hunter for — I don't know — since I was about 12, I think. I have my phone here. It's got a blaze orange and camouflage cover because it reminds me that after we elect Mitt Romney president, I get to take my daughter deer hunting. [applause]
I want to thank you, Virginia. I want to thank our lieutenant governor, Bill Bolling. I want to thank my friend Bob Goodlatte and George Allen. He sent his better half, Sue Allen. Thank you for coming here. Thank you for making Virginia a better place. [applause] Friends — I love you too, ma'am. Every now and then, we see a glimpse into the future. Last night, we saw a clear picture. We saw a clear choice. [applause] Last night, America got to see the man I know, a leader, a decisive man, an optimistic man, a man with a plan to get people back to work and to protect our freedoms. [applause]
You know, every now and then, President Obama in a moment of candor kind of reveals his thoughts. Remember four years ago when he was talking to a bunch of people in San Francisco? He said people in the Midwest like us, they like to cling to their guns and their religion. Well, hey, this Catholic deer hunter is guilty as charged and proud of it. [applause]
You know another issue that came up. Taxes — last night, President Obama made it very clear he's going to raise taxes. Today Vice President Joe Biden made it even more clear. In Iowa, he said — he asked himself a question and he asked if he and President Obama want a trillion dollar tax hike. And his response to himself was, yes, we do. That's a direct quote, friends. Well, Virginia, no, we don't. [applause]
Mitt's going to talk about this in a minute. But what we don't need is a trillion-dollar tax increase. Actually, it's a bit more than that. He was half right. What we don't need is a tax increase on our successful job creators that will cost us 700,000 jobs. Just two years ago the president said you don't want to raise taxes in a bad economy. The economy was better then than it is now. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a big choice.
It's not just about taxes. It's about freedom. It's about our principles. It's about our country. It's about the idea of our country. America is so much more than just a country with a flag. It is an idea. These ideas make us who we are. They make us special. I'm going to say something that in Washington is considered kind of out of date or wrong. And it's this: America is an exceptional nation and we are not afraid to say so. [applause]
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
REP. RYAN: We have a chance to get ourselves on the right track. We have a chance to vote for somebody who's going to protect our freedoms, who's going to vote, who's going to act, who's going to lead to protect our religious freedom, who's going to act to protect our Second Amendment rights. Ladies and gentlemen, right here in Virginia, we have a big choice to make. America has a big choice to make.
And America's going to make the right choice because they saw so clearly last night who the right man for the job is. That man is standing back here. He's going to be the next president of the United States. His name is Mitt Romney. Ladies and gentlemen, join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney! [applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Now, that is one heck of a Virginia welcome. Thank you, Virginia! [applause] Thank you, Paul. We're going to be a great team. We're taking back this country together. You know that. [applause] Thank you to Trace as well. Trace Adkins and his music, doesn't that just brighten your day? Thank you so much, Trace, for being here, getting things started. Thank you also for the endorsement of the NRA. We respect the Second Amendment in this country. We appreciate the endorsement. You guys are going to help us win this election, right? [applause]
Now, last night was an important night for the country because people got the — [applause] — they got the chance to cut through all the attacks and counterattacks and all of the theatrics associated with a campaign. And instead, they were able to listen to substance. And I appreciate the fact that Jim Lehrer asked questions of substance and we each responded to them. I got the chance to ask the president questions that people across the country have wanted to ask him such as why is it that he pushed "Obamacare" at a time when we had 23 million people out of work. [applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Exactly!
MR. ROMNEY: I asked, you know, why is it that the middle class is still buried in this country, why is it we have 23 million people out of work, why is it half of our kids are coming out of college can't find good jobs, why is it that 1 out of 6 people have fallen into poverty, why is it that when he took office 32 million people were on food stamps and today 47 million people are on food stamps.
I asked him those questions and you heard his answers. And I think as a result of those answers, the American people recognized that he and I stand for something very different. I'm going to help the American people get good jobs and a bright future. [applause] Now, even more important than just what was happening in the past was what he plans on doing for the future. And he got the chance to describe his vision for the future and what it was was more of the same. He described a series of ideas which we've heard before.
He talks about a stimulus. He talks about hiring more government workers. He talks about the government making investments. And of course, he talks about raising taxes. The vice president blurted out the truth today. They plan on raising taxes on the American people and that will kill jobs. We will not let that happen. We want to create jobs, not kill jobs in this country. [applause]
We also heard this plan of raising taxes not only includes "Obamacare" and the taxes associated with it, and of course cutting Medicare by $716 billion. But in fact, there's been a study just released this week where the people who put together the study looked at his spending plans and all the debt that they created and all the interest that gets charged and they said, you know what, he's going to raise taxes on the middle class as well by some $4,000 a family.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: The American people do not want higher taxes.
They want less spending and more growth and we will bring them less spending and more growth and get America on track to a balanced budget. [applause] I don't want to raise taxes on anybody. I don't want to raise taxes on anybody. And this president, by the way, he seems to think that keeping our taxes the same as they are now is a huge tax cut. Only in Washington would you think keeping your taxes as they are is a huge tax cut. I'm going to keep our taxes where they are and then find a way to bring them down for people in the middle class by saying this: you will pay no tax on your interest, dividends and capital gains if you're in the middle class. We're going to give the middle class a tax break. [applause]
And you know — you know when it comes to creating jobs that Paul Ryan and I actually have a plan. And it's not — it's not a repeat of the last four years because we can't afford four more years like the last four years. It's an entirely different directions and it has five major parts. And you heard me mention them last night. But I want to do it again.
Number one, we're going to take advantage of our energy — our coal, our gas, our natural gas, our oil, our renewables, our nuclear. And there are some differences here. The president has cut in half the number of permits and licenses on federal lands and in federal waters. I'll double them. And the president has made it almost impossible — virtually impossible to build a coal fire facility in this country. I want to keep using our coal. We've got a lot of it. I want to use it. [applause]
And of course, the president blocked the Keystone Pipeline. I'll build it. We'll get that oil in here from Canada. [applause] I'm going to open up more trade. We can trade very effectively with great benefit for our people if we trade on a fair basis with people around the world. But when people steal our jobs through unfair trading practices as China has, I will hold them accountable and call them on the carpet. We cannot let our jobs be stolen unfairly. [applause]
And I want to make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed. And that's why I want training programs that actually prepare people for the jobs of today. Right now, we have 47 different federal training programs reporting to eight different agencies. Think of the overhead, the bureaucracy and the waste. I want to talk all of that money, bundle it up, give Virginia its fair share and say you create the training programs that work for your own people. Get the federal government out of it. [applause]
And you know — you know, you're not going to get entrepreneurs to start a new business or big corporations to expand and build a new facility and hire more people if they think we're on the road to Greece. And if this president is reelected, that's the very road he'll keep us on. I will finally cut federal spending, cap federal spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause]
And the fifth — the fifth step to get this economy going and create jobs is to do this: champion small business, help small businesses, help them grow, keep their taxes down, make sure regulations work for small business. And by the way, the president has an idea which is a very bad idea when it comes to small business.
This is the idea — this is his idea of taking away the right of the secret ballot for our workers when they decide whether or not they want a union. I think our workers should have the right to a secret ballot. He wants to take it away. I will protect the right of our workers and keep unions from being forced on businesses where neither the company nor the employees want them. [applause]
Now, President Obama says that he's created 5 million new jobs. What he hasn't told you — what he hasn't told you is that when a recession ends the economy always begins to come back, begins to create jobs except it hasn't created the jobs like it should have. What's happened is this has been the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. As a matter of fact, he said right now we would be at 5.4 percent unemployment. Instead, we're at 8.1 percent. You might think, well those numbers don't sound too different. Let me tell you how different they are — 9 million jobs different. That's the difference.
When Paul and I get to the White House, we'll get America back to work with our plan for 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. [applause] And by the way, let me make this point clear as well: 8.1 percent unemployment understates what's really going on and the real pain in our economy on two fronts. One is there are a lot of people working that are having a hard time making ends meet as their incomes have gone down by $4,300 a year and as prices for gasoline have doubled and electricity is up and food is up and health insurance costs are up.
Middle income families, even those that have jobs are having an awful hard year. But there's another way in which this 8.1 percent underestimates the pain in this country. And that's because the reason — the principle reason that the unemployment rate has been creeping down, the principle reason is because people have dropped out of the workforce. They've stopped looking and they don't count them when they decide how many people are unemployed.
As a matter of fact, if the same share of the workforce were actually engaged in looking for a job right now as when the president took office, the unemployment rate wouldn't be shown at 8.1 percent. It would be shown at 11.2 percent. That's the comparable number. The president is trying to convince people he's doing real well. He is not. This recovery is not what we need. When Paul Ryan and I get to Washington, we will begin a real recovery that'll put America back to work again. [applause]
What you didn't hear last night from the president is why it is the next four years are going to possibly be better than the last four years. He doesn't have a way to explain that because he has the same policies for the next four years he had over the last four years. He said go forward. I call it forewarned, all right. [laughter] We do not want four more years like that. And I'm absolutely convinced, by the way, that actually on the day after Paul Ryan and I get elected — and I mean with your help we're getting elected — [applause] — that you're going to see enterprises small and large decide to open their doors and expand.
And people are going to say we're going to see the kind of recovery America really needs and deserves. I know that because I have confidence in the heart of the American people. I know we're an entrepreneurial, innovative and patriotic people. We love this country. We sacrifice for America. There is no other nation on Earth quite like it. Paul said a moment ago that we're an exceptional nation. I believe that. I believe that when the Founders wrote that document known as the Declaration of Independence that they changed the world with the insight that God gave us our rights, not the government, but God gave us our rights. [applause]
And life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, these are rights which we have. And they have led this nation to share this vision with people around the world. I love America. My confidence in the future comes from my passion for this country and for the people of this country. Do you realize how unusual we are as a people and how — where it came from, whether it's these very Founders and their vision. I don't know how it began. But it's here. It's in our hearts. I was some years ago when I was serving as governor of my state, the then president of Israel, Shimon Peres, came to — now president also — came to Boston.
And I happened to be having a lunch with him in someone's apartment. And one of the people standing around him at lunchtime said: Mr. Peres, or President Peres, what do you think about America's involvement in Iraq. Now, this was at the time the Iraq war was still underway. And he said: You know, before I answer that, I need to put this in context. He said: America is the greatest nation in the history of the Earth.
And he said: I say that because of this. He said: In the history of the Earth, whenever there's been war, whenever there's been conflict, the nation that wins takes land away from the nation that loses because land has always been the source of value on the planet. He said: One nation in history, one nation has laid down the lives of hundreds and thousands of its sons and daughters and taken no land. America. America is unique in the history of the Earth. [applause]
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: And you know, former secretary of State, Colin Powell, said this. He said: In fact, the only land America has taken from other lands is enough land to bury our dead. This is a great nation and an exceptional nation. We have people in this nation who prize freedom, who love the country which was based upon rights given by God. We face extraordinary challenges but we're an extraordinary people.
What we need is to have leadership — leadership in Washington who can work with Republicans and Democrats, who'll get America back on track, who will do those things that restore the principles that made America the shining city on a hill Ronald Reagan spoke of so eloquently. I love this country. I love the people of this country. I love the prospect we have of getting America strong again.
I will keep this nation strong with your help. We're taking back the White House. We're going all the way to Washington. Paul Ryan and I are going to get America on track. This nation's coming back. We're going to get our economy going. We're going to keep our military strong. We're going to keep our values first and foremost, the values that shaped the Earth. Thank you so very much! Great to be with you! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks at the Colorado Conservative Political Action Committee Conference in Denver

October 4, 2012

[cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Colorado, thank you so much.
I heard that the Colorado CPAC was meeting, and we didn't have this planned, but decided to stop by just to say hello. When I heard my boys were going to be here, I couldn't resist. [cheers and applause]
I want to thank you for the work you're doing. I know how important it is. I know this is going to be a close-fought battle. We need to win Colorado. If we do, you know what? We're going to take back the White House. [cheers and applause]
I finally — I finally got here. It was fun to be here and to feel all the energy that you have here. I know of your enthusiasm, I know of your passion for America. [cheers and applause] [inaudible] — for the path for prosperity and peace, but for that to happen, you guys are going to have to cheer here and then go out and knock on doors and get people who voted for President Obama to see the light, come join our team.
And if you do that, why — why, we'll all be able to come together and have a wonderful inauguration celebration in January. [cheers and applause]
Now, you know, last night, I thought it was a great opportunity for the American people to see two very different visions for the country.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right.
MR. ROMNEY: And I — I think it was — it was helpful to be able to describe those visions. I — I saw the president's vision as trickle-down government, and I don't think that's what American believes in. I — I — I see instead, a prosperity that comes through freedom. [cheers]
And we have two very different courses for America — trickle-down government or prosperity through freedom. And trickle-down government that the president proposes is one where — where he will raises taxes on small business, which will kill jobs.
I instead want to keep taxes down on small business so we can create jobs. This is about good jobs for the American people. [cheers and applause]
If — if we continue down his path, there's no question but the middle class — which the vice president noted has been buried — [laughter] — will continue to be buried with higher and higher expenses for gasoline, for food, for utilities, for health insurance. If I'm elected instead, we're going to see prices moderated because we're going to have people have higher incomes again, we're going to have rising incomes in America because we're going to have more jobs. We're going to have a stronger America with more jobs, rising incomes, moderated prices — that's a very different path than one with trickle-down government.
Now, there's another place there's difference, and that's with regards to energy prices. Under trickle-down government, you have the president saying that — well, you remember in his last campaign — that under his policies in energy the prices would necessarily skyrocket. Well, I believe that in alternative we should have North American energy independence, use the energy we have; it'll create jobs, keep our costs down and — (inaudible, cheers, applause) — with our economy. [cheers and applause]
And — and you heard — you heard the president last night describe how he plans on reducing the deficit. He said it was $4 trillion. But only in Washington would you count $4 trillion of reduction when in fact his plan calls for adding a trillion dollars of debt every one of the next four years. [boos] The Congressional Budget Office says by that the end of a four-year period, if he were to be reelected, trickle-down government would lead to a setting where we would have $20 trillion in debt.
I think that's wrong. I think we should instead take a course represented by freedom which says we're going to finally get America to cap our spending, to cut our spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
It's — it's not often, I'm told, that Republicans are able to go out and talk about Medicare with such passion, as we do. But let me tell you: When someone is taking $716 billion away from our current seniors in their Medicare plan to pay for "Obamacare" we say, no way. We're going to put it back and we're going to get rid of "Obamacare." [cheers and applause]
And then — and then there's for the military. The president has proposed cutting our military budget, and then this sequestration idea that came out of the White House — [booing] — cuts our military budget even more. We're looking at about a trillion dollars in cuts. The secretary of defense has said that those cuts would be devastating to our military. Can you imagine allowing cuts of that nature to proceed, as this president seems to be willing to do? If I'm president, we will restore the strength of American military; we will not cut the — (inaudible, cheers, applause) — in my budget. [cheers and applause]
Now, you know — you know how important is this. Trickle-down government will not create the jobs Americans need. Trickle-down government will not bring down the cost of energy. Trickle-down government will not allow incomes to rise. Freedom is what drives America's economy. [cheers and applause] Free people pursuing their dreams, economic freedom — [applause] — and we're bringing it back.
And — and the consequence for doing it right versus doing it wrong is really extraordinary. This — this is about the 23 million people in this country that are out of work or stopped looking for work or just given up. This is about the one out of six people that have fallen into poverty. It's about the 47 million people that are on food stamps. We — we don't measure compassion by how many people we can put on food stamps; we measure compassion by how many people we can get a good job — (inaudible, cheers, applause.)
So this is about — this is about those 23 million people. It's about the next generation. For the first time in history, Americans believe the future's not as bright as the past and that their kinds won't enjoy the kind of prosperity that they've enjoyed. Well, that would happen, I'm afraid, if President Obama were reelected. It will not happen when I become the next president. [cheers and applause]
And it's — and it's — [inaudible] [applause] — of the world, as well. And I — I think you understand this. I — I've been fond over the last few weeks of describing my trip to Poland a few weeks ago, when I got the chance to meet with a world hero, Lech Walesa. [cheers and applause]
Champion of freedom. I came in to see him, by the way, and he — he met me graciously, shook my hand and said, you must be tired; you've come from America. You sit, I'll talk, you listen. [laughter]
So I did. I sat down and he began to speak. And over a period of about 15 minutes, he repeated these words time and time again: Where is American leadership? We need American leadership. [applause] We need American lead. I mean, he described an area of the world, the Middle East or other parts of the world, and he's — after — after each area and the tumult in that area, he'd say, where's American leadership? You are the only superpower on the planet. We need America to lead. And American leadership begins with strong values and principles in our homes and communities. [cheers and applause]
It — [inaudible] — economy. That's why we're spending so much time talking about our economy, because everything we do diplomatically, culturally, militarily, flows from having a strong economy. And so we must rekindle the American economy. These last three years, this has not been a real recovery. Oh, it bumps up, it bumps down, you're going to see ups and downs over the coming months I'm sure. But this is not the trend you want to see. So far this year, America's economy is growing more slowly than last year. And last year, it grew more slowly than the year before. This is not the recovery we need. The Federal Reserve, bringing more money, doing everything that they can, trying to prop this things up. We need to rekindle the strong economy.
If America's going to have that last builder of our strength, which is the strong military, I will not cut our military. It will be second to none. It'll be so strong — [cheers and applause] — [inaudible].
The people last night were given a choice. They were given a choice between two different visions for America: one where we continue down the road to become more and more like Europe, where a government gets larger and larger, more and more intrusive in our lives, spending more and more, borrowing more and more, putting us on a road to Greece.
And the other is a path that returns America to America; where we restore the principles of freedom and hope and opportunity that this nation has always been built upon. I will take us there, with your help. We're going to take back this country — (inaudible, cheers, applause.) Thank you so much. (Inaudible, cheers, applause.)

Remarks with Ann Romney at a Campaign Event in St. Petersburg, Florida

October 5, 2012

MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, wow! What a thrill! What a St. Petersburg welcome. Thank you so much!
AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Artur Davis. What a great congressman! And I am pleased this evening to be joined by the most wonderful woman I've ever known, my sweetheart, Ann Romney. Ann, say hi. [applause]
ANN ROMNEY: Oh it's so great to be here and it's so great to know that so many of you are feeling the same feelings we're feeling. It's time to save this country. [applause] I was so thrilled at the debate for people to see my husband unfiltered without any negative ads, without any media trying to interpret what he says and what he feels in his heart. This is a man that cares about the American people. [applause]
I've seen him throughout his life exhibit extraordinary compassion for others. What he's taught my sons I will never forget and never wonder how they turned out as they have because they watched their father give service throughout his life, caring for others, being there for others. This is what we need right now, someone that understands the economy, that is confident, that understands, that cares. So I'm looking forward to the next debate. [applause]
I'm also looking forward to hearing Paul Ryan next week. So we're going to have — [applause] — we're going to have — the next four weeks are so important that all of us understand how critical this election is, how important it is that we get someone in office that will turn the economy around, get people working and listen to the voices of all those millions of Americans out there that are crying for help. So thank you all very much. [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, sweetheart. [applause] She's the best. Now, I want to thank Artur Davis for standing up here and showing — and getting behind our team. He's a great American and I appreciate his help and support. [applause] I want to thank Gus Bilirakis as well, running for Congress again. Give him your support.
Where are you, Gus? He's around here somewhere. And also thanks to Congressman Bill Young. We need to get him reelected as well. [applause] And Mayor Rick Baker, where's the mayor? He's usually towering — standing very tall around here and I appreciate him. And by the way, we need to make — there he is, back there, back row. There's the former mayor right there. Good to see you, my friend.
And we need to make sure that Connie Mack becomes the next U.S. senator from this great state. [applause] Now, with Ann I agree. I enjoyed that debate a couple of nights ago. That was a great experience. [applause]
It was a chance — I think that Jim Lehrer did an excellent job in raising issues and having the candidates talk about our views on issues rather than just the gotcha thing that sometimes happens with media interviews. I thought it was a good chance for us ask each other questions. I asked the president some of the questions I know people across America have wanted to ask him.
I asked him, for instance, why with 23 million Americans that were looking for work and wanted a president that would focus on getting the economy going he instead spent his first two years fighting for "Obamacare."
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: I asked him why with gasoline prices so high he decided to cut in half the number of permits and licenses on federal lands and in federal waters and also wouldn't build the Keystone pipeline. I got a chance —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: I got a chance to ask him why it was with a deficit so severe and such a threat to our future that the president would spend $90 billion on so-called green energy jobs.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: Anybody here have one of those? [laughter] I keep looking. Why it was when he called the deficits un-American and unpatriotic, he was the one that created the first trillion-dollar deficit and had a trillion-dollar deficit every one of his four years in office. I asked him again why it was when he said that in his first year his highest priority will be to put in place an immigration plan that would solve our immigration problems, why instead he never filed a piece of legislation for immigration reform.
I asked him one more question and that was why it was that when he promised that health insurance premiums would go down for the average family in America by $2,500 a year, this year it'd be down by $2,500, instead it's gone up by $2,500. And you know what, with median incomes in America at about $50,000, that $5,000 difference is a huge difference for the American people. This has been a tough time. And you know, we heard his answers, or his non-answers, as the case may be. [laughter]
But you can't really blame him because he pointed out the other day that you can't fix Washington from the inside. He said he's got to do it from the outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: Now, we did agree — we did agree on one thing and that is this is a critical election and that the paths we would take our nation down are quite different. He, for instance, is going to raise taxes. His vice president this week blurted out the truth. They plan on raising taxes a trillion dollars. They already raised them a trillion so it's really 2 trillion (dollars) when you put that together. That's an increase in taxes on small business among other places. And by the way, that'll mean less jobs. It's been calculated that his tax plan — raising taxes — will cost 700,000 jobs.
I will not raise taxes on small business and I will not raise taxes on middle income families. [applause] And rather than costing 700,000 jobs, my tax plan will help create 7 million jobs. So it's a very different approach. If he's reelected, why, his plans would take us down to installing "Obamacare". By the way, that extra 2,500 (dollars) you're spending this year, it'll go up even more because the Congressional Budget Office has calculated that "Obamacare" will cost another $2,500 above what you'd otherwise be paying.
And also with "Obamacare" you'll put a bureaucrat in the doctor's office with you. In my view we've got to focus on getting the cost of health care under control and we have to repeal and replace "Obamacare" and I'll do it. [applause] Now, his plan takes us down a course that will cut our funding for Medicare for today's seniors — not for tomorrow's seniors — for today's seniors by $716 billion. I will honor the promise made to our seniors. I'll restore the $716 billion he would cut. [applause]
If he was going to get reelected, why, you know what's going to happen which is another four years of trillion-dollar deficits, putting us on the way to 20 trillion (dollars). You see that clock. There it is over there. Our national debt right now, 16.1 trillion (dollars). That would be 20 trillion (dollars) if he were reelected at the end of his fourth year. And let me tell you, that would put in jeopardy the American dream for our kids and actually for a lot of us as well. And so, I'm going to do this. I'm going to make sure we cut federal spending and we cap federal spending at 20 percent of the budget and we finally get America on track to a balanced budget. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: Now, he got a chance to explain his jobs program, how he's going to create new jobs in America. Did you hear what he had to say? I didn't either. [laughter] I kept looking for a specific plan as to what he was going to do to create jobs. I heard more of the same — stimulus, hiring more government workers, raising taxes. Those things don't create jobs. They cost jobs. The American people are having a hard time right now. You realize if the number of people in America — the participation of our adults in the workforce — were the same as at the time he got elected, why our unemployment rate would be about 11 percent.
People in this country are having a hard time finding a job. People in this country are having a hard time making ends meet even if they do have a job. And so it's time to have someone who's elected president who actually has a plan and I do. We'll create 12 million jobs and rising incomes. That's the kind of future we need to have for America. [applause] And you know — you know the things. I've got five things. You heard me talk about them.
I don't have to look at notes to know what they are, by the way. I know what they are, all right. [laughter] Number one — number one, we're going to take advantage of our energy — our coal, our gas, our oil, our nuclear, our renewables. [applause] We're going to double the number of permits on federal lands and in federal waters and we're going to get the oil off the shore of Alaska and we're going to build that pipeline from Canada as well and get that oil here. [applause]
And that means lower gasoline prices because we've got to take advantage of our energy resources here. People are struggling under the high cost of energy. And that, by the way, creates new jobs too — 3-1/2 to 4 million jobs will come back if we really take advantage of our energy resources.
Number two, we're going to make trade work for us. We're going to open up new markets for trade. You particularly here in Florida will have opportunities to sell goods in Latin America nearby, language opportunities and time zone opportunities. We'll do well opening up more trade. But I'll tell you this. I will crack down on China or any other nation that cheats. [applause]
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: There's a third thing. My third thing is this. I want to make sure that our people have the skills for the jobs of today. So those 47 different federal training programs that all report into eight different agencies, think of the waste and the overhead. I want to take the money from those programs, give Florida its fair share and say, Florida, you create the programs best for your own people. Get the federal government out of it. [applause]
And I want to fix our schools. I want to fix our schools for the jobs of tomorrow so our kids have the skills they need to succeed. And I know what it takes to do that. It takes a focus on the teachers. Let me tell you, for us to fix our schools it means put the kids and the parents and the teachers first and put the teachers union behind like you've done here in Florida. [applause]
Number four, I want to make sure that every entrepreneur and every business that's thinking about growing knows that America's not going to become Greece or otherwise they won't invest here. Were on the path to Greece with the kind of spending this president is doing. And so, I'm going to make sure we balance the budget as I described earlier. And one more thing. I'm going to champion small business. [applause]
This is where our jobs come from. Sixty-five percent of all the jobs in America over the last 15 years came from small business. And they're getting crushed right now with higher taxes and regulators that don't understand small business. There's also this idea known as card check. You may not have heard of this. The president promotes it. He's promised to push it when he speaks with the AFL-CIO. He's going to take away the right of our workers to vote by secret ballot as to whether or not they want a union. And that would force unions on workers that don't want hem and businesses that don't want them.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: I will protect and help small business. We'll get small business growing again and get America creating jobs with small businesses succeeding. [applause] Two very different paths — I've got a path to create 12 million jobs. His answer is, well, we're just going to go forward. And I think forewarned is a better word. We know where his policies lead and that's — we do not want and we cannot afford four more years like the last four years. [applause]
Now, I want you to know how confident I am in the future. I'm confident as I see you here. I know of your patriotism and your love of the country. I know you're not here just because you like me — well, maybe because you like Ann. [applause] And even because you're conservative Republicans but because you care about America. That's what brings you here. And I've seen America. I've seen the greatness of the human spirit in my fellow Americans. It gives me confidence in our future. I know we can rise to the occasion time and again.
I've seen it throughout my life. When I was — well, a kid in school — actually this was in graduate school. I got to meet a guy named Billy Hulse. And Bill began a business and was very successful and then he was involved in an accident and became a quadriplegic. And I just saw him a couple of weeks ago — I think three weeks ago in Atlanta. He came to an event. And it's not easy for Billy to get around, a quadriplegic. But his wife was there and he can't move, of course, his arms or his legs and he can barely speak.
And they brought him forward, a big crowd around him, very hot. I reached down and I put my hand on Billy's shoulder and I whispered into his ear and I said: Billy, God bless you. I love you. And he whispered back to me. I couldn't quite hear what he said. He tried to speak loud enough for me to hear. He died the next day. And Billy's courage was seen in his life because even after this accident he devoted himself to things he cared about like spinal injury research. It's a great man. I've seen that kind of spirit.
I saw it in a young boy. When I was a younger man living in Massachusetts, I used to visit a family. You may have seen them at the Republican convention not far from here, the Oparowski family. I saw them regularly. And then their son David at age about 14 got leukemia and moved very quickly. It was clear he was not going to make it. And I went into his room one night when he was in bed and he asked me a very difficult question. He said: Mitt, what's next? He called me Brother Romney. What's next?
And I talked to him about what I believe is next. And then a few days later when he was in the hospital I got a call. As I recall I was at work and he said: could you come by. And he said: You went to law school, right? Yeah. He said: Could you come by and write my will for me? This is a 14-year-old, a son of a firefighter in Medford, Massachusetts. And so I went to David's bedside and got out a piece of legal paper and made it look very official.
And then David proceeded to tell me what he wanted to give to his friends. He talked about his fishing rod and who would get that. He talked about his skateboard, who'd get that. And his rifle, that went to his brother. I've seen the character of a young man like David who wasn't emotional or crying. He had his eyes wide open. There's a saying: Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose. David couldn't lose. I love that young man. [applause]
I met a woman at the — I met a woman at the GOP convention — Jane Horton of Oklahoma.
Her husband, a sharpshooter in the United States military, often Afghanistan, on the day she's packaging up some goodies to go into his birthday package, the door — knock comes at the door. And they inform her that her husband had been killed. And she decides to devote herself to helping the families of others who've lost their loved ones. He was killed on September 9th of 2011. And this was a time when some very misguided people were protesting at the funerals of our servicemen and women. You recall that?
And they came to the funeral of her husband. And she was asked what do you think about this. And this is the quote. She said this: Chris died for them to be able to protest. Chris died for them to be able to protest. This is quite a nation we live in. We have some extraordinary people. [applause]
AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, I love our national hymns. I love our national hymns and anthems. I love that stanza, that verse in "America the Beautiful": O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Will the members of our Armed Forces here and our veterans please raise your hand so we can recognize you? [applause] Wow. On Memorial Day, I was in San Diego and I got to stand next to four fellows, as I recall, who had all served in the Second World War.
The one right next to me had been on the USS Tennessee on the day it was hit in Pearl Harbor. He was the lookout. He said he could lock eyes and did lock eyes with the pilot that was bringing in armament that would hit their ship. He was injured but went on to serve for 33 years in the U.S. Navy. These men and women are the greatest generation. They held a torch for the whole world to free, the torch of freedom, liberty, honesty, integrity hope.
And there are not as many of them as there used to be. And they're getting older. So they can't hold the torch quite as high. I was inspired just the other day. I happened to be in Toledo, Ohio.
AUDIECE MEMBER: [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: A Toledo girl, right there. Wow, front row. And this was an honor flight coming back. I was leaving at the airport just as this honor flight was coming in with men and women mostly from the Second World War but also from the Korean War that had been to Washington, D.C., to see the memorials and come home. And I went at the bottom of the ramp they were using to come off the airplane and shook their hands as they came off the aircraft.
And the last few that came off were in wheelchairs. They're getting pretty old. And one of them, the second to the last, he came down. I shook his hand and wished him the very best. And then they were proceeding to roll him out. And it was a cord kind of like this with flags on each side with people clapping and cheering as these soldiers would be brought through. And as they were ready to push him through that corridor of flags, he stopped the person pushing them and worked to get into his coat and pulled out an American flag and started to wave it.
This is a great nation. This is a great people. [applause] We face extraordinary challenged right now in this country. But I'm absolutely convinced that given the patriotism of the American people, given our passion for one another and our compassion as a people, and given the can-do, entrepreneurial spirit of America, we're going to overcome any challenge we have as long as we have leaders that'll tell the truth and fight for America. It's time for us to grab that torch that the greatest generation has held, the torch of liberty and freedom. [applause]
And right here in Florida, I have a commitment to make to you. And that is we're going to grab that torch together. I'm going to do everything in my power to keep America strong, to build strong families, to preserve strong values, to build a strong economy, to keep a military second to none in the world — [applause]. And I've got a request of you. I want you also to commit.
I want you to go find someone who voted for President Obama last time and convince them — well, just remind them how bad it's been these last four years and tell them to get on the train with us because I'm counting on Florida. We're going to win Florida and we're going to take back the White House. You guys are going to make it happen. We're going to make America strong again. Thank you so very much. Thank you so much, St. Petersburg. You guys are the best. Thank you! [applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Abingdon, Virginia

October 5, 2012

[cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Wow. That's quite a welcome. Thank you, Virginia. [cheers and applause] Thank you! That is —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Mitt! [cheers]
MR. ROMNEY: I love you too, guys. [cheers] Boy —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Gosh, I just — I just spent a half hour or so with some of your fine citizens from this area, folks who are working in this area that want to keep working in this area — wonderful couple that has a farm that — now they wonder whether they'll be able to keep the farm because the — the husband lost his job at the coal mine.
These are — these are tough times in this community. But you are strong and confident and patriotic people and we're going to bring back jobs and bring back America. [cheers and applause]
Now, somewhere Congressman Morgan Griffith is here. Where is — Morgan Griffith. Where's he hanging out? Is he over here? Hello, Congressman. How are you? Good to see you. Thanks for being here.
You got to make sure to re-elect this guy. Morgan Griffith is one of the best. [cheers and applause]
And by the way, we'd have the governor here today, but he's down in Florida campaigning for me. So thank you to Bob McDonald for all the work he's doing, a great governor. [cheers and applause]
And you may know that a couple of nights ago, we had a debate. You may have gotten the chance to see that. [cheers and applause] And it was a good experience, I think, for me, for the president, for people who watched. It was a debate of substance. We talked about the issues that America faces.
I got the chance to ask the president some questions that people — I think people across the country have wanted to ask the president, such as why — why it was that when America was needing jobs so badly, he was pushing for "Obamacare" instead of working to get jobs for the American people. [boos]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah! [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Got the chance to ask him why there's still 23 million Americans that are out of work or have stopped looking for work, struggling to find good full-time jobs. I got the chance to ask him why it is the middle class is so buried in this country. Incomes have gone down, prices of gasoline have doubled, prices of food and clothing and almost everything else you buy has gone up. People in the middle class have been squeezed. They've been buried, as the vice president said. Got the chance to talk about that.
Got the chance to ask him why he's cutting $716 billion from Medicare. That's not the right thing to do, to pay for "Obamacare." [boos] And I also got to point out that he's in favor of a tax plan that will kill 700,000 jobs.
[boos] And so he had the chance to answer those questions — or not answer them, as the case may be.
But then — (jeers) — I think even more important was the chance to talk about where we're going in the future and what he would what I'd do. And — and what he described was, in my view, a — a reiteration of the status quo. He's going to keep doing the things he's done in the past. He's going to have a stimulus if he can. He's going to hire more government workers if he can. He's going to pick winners and losers like Solyndra, Fisker and Tesla. (Scattered jeers.) A friend of mine said, no, he — he doesn't like picking winners and losers; he just likes picking losers. [laughter]
And so — and of course, he's in favor of higher taxes. Yesterday the vice president blurted out the truth. He said in fact they do want to raise taxes a trillion dollars. Well, I don't want to raise taxes on any Americans because I want to create good jobs in America. [cheers and applause]
Now, I take America in a very different direction. First of all, I want to make sure that our policies encourage job growth. And I have five things I'll do. You've heard me describe them time and again, but five things I'll do that'll get jobs growing in this country again and growing right here in this part of Virginia as well, because number one on my list is to take full advantage of all our energy resources, our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. [cheers and applause]
And I know you care a lot more about coal than the other ones I just mentioned. So let me just remind you that when the president was running for office, he said that if you built a — a new coal-fired plant, why, you go bankrupt. And the head of the EPA has — has also said that the regulations on burning coal are now so stringent it's virtually impossible to build a new coal-fired plant.
Well, I don't believe in putting our — our coal under the — under the ground forever. I believe we should take advantage of it, put American workers back to work and use a resource that's abundant and cheap and can be burned in a clean way. [cheers and applause]
And by the way, I also believe in — in oil and gas. I believe we should develop our resources. I believe within eight years, America — North America, rather, should be energy-independent, and that requires all those sources of energy. [cheers and applause] And that'll keep — that'll keep the price at the pump moderated. It will keep the price of electricity moderated. It'll also mean a lot of good jobs for Americans. It's been calculated if we're really serious about energy, really take advantage of the energy resources we have, that you're going to create some 3.5 (million) to 4 million jobs.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: I know right now you're thinking about one job, your job. I'm thinking about your job as well, person by person. Every American deserves a good job. People are hardworking right here in this community. I want to make sure your jobs stay here, grow here and provide a bright future for you and for your family. [cheers and applause]
Now I also — I also believe, in addition to energy, that — that we have an opportunity to create more jobs by selling our goods and services abroad. So I want to open up more trade with other nations. And if China's stealing jobs unfairly, I'll crack down on China. (Cheers, chanting, applause.)
Number three — number three, I want to make sure that our people have the skills they need to succeed, so we have a lot of government training programs, and that's at — that's all file and — fine and well, except there are 47 of them, federal government training programs, and they report to eight different government agencies and so the — the overhead cost of all of this — this burden and bureaucracy is just killing — I'd like to take the money the federal government is spending on training, bundle it up, send back to Virginia its fair share and let Virginia do what's right for the people of Virginia with their training dollars. [cheers and applause]
And let me — let me mention — as my number four here to get this economy going and to create more good jobs, let me mention something about the deficit. This idea of every year America spending in the federal government a trillion dollars more than we take in is bad for our economy. It's also bad for the next generation. As I said during that debate, I think it's immoral for us to keep spending more than we take in. So I will cut federal spending, I will cap federal spending, and I'll get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
And people ask me how I'm going to do that, I said — again, as I said the other night, I'm going to cut out programs we don't absolutely have to have; and number two, I'm going to make sure that some programs go back to the states, where they can be run more efficiently and effectively. We're going to cut back on the size of the federal government.
And one of the programs I'm going to get rid of is "Obamacare." [cheers and applause] We can't afford it; we don't need it; it's the wrong way.
And finally let me mention a fifth idea, and that is I want to champion small business. [cheers and applause] I want to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses, to grow. And I know how to do that.
The president has an unusual tax plan. His plan is to raise taxes, particularly on successful small businesses, that happen to employ a quarter of all America's private-sector workforce. He wants to raise their taxes from 35 percent to 40 percent.
And by the way, when you take that together with state income tax and payroll tax and real estate tax and gasoline tax and you take them all together, that means small businesses that are highly successful are going to end up giving more than half of what they got to government. And that's going to kill jobs.
I don't want to kill jobs. My priority is creating jobs. I'll help small business do that with everything I can do. [cheers and applause]
Now, we can do better. We don't have to stay on the path we've been on. We can do better.
There — there was a — a report that just came out this morning on job creation this last month. There were fewer new jobs created this month than last month. And the — the unemployment rate, as you (know ?), this year has come down very, very slowly, but it's come down nonetheless. The reason it's come down this year is primarily due to the fact that more and more people have just stopped looking for work. And if you just drop out of the workforce, if you just give up and say, look, I can't go back to work, I'm just going to stay home, if you just drop out altogether, why, you're no longer a part of the employment statistics. So it looks like unemployment's getting better, but the truth is, if the same share of people were participating in the workforce today as on the day the president got elected, why, our unemployment rate would be around 11 percent. That's the real reality of what's happening out there.
And then of course, even those that have jobs are having tough times. The middle class is being squeezed with higher and higher costs and with incomes that have gone down by $4,300 a family. This can't go on. I'll tell you this. When I'm president of the United States, when I'm president of the United States — [cheers and applause] — that — that unemployment rate is going to come down, not because people are giving up and dropping out of the workforce, but because we're creating more jobs. I will create jobs and get America working again. [cheers and applause]
And so the American people have a choice. I — I think in both — both men, we have individuals who care very deeply about our country and care about the people of America. But we were — but we would lead America in very different ways. This president calls his policies going forward. I call his policies forewarned, all right? [cheers] We know — we know where they head because we've seen them over the last four years. We've seen 23 million people out of work. We've seen half the kids coming out of college not able to get work or college-level work.
We've seen incomes go down. We've seen trillion-dollar deficits. The road this president's put us on looks like Europe. Europe isn't working in Europe. It'll never work here. (Whoops.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: Look, the president — if he's — if he's re-elected, this president is going to have trillion-dollar deficits every year. We'd end up with about a $20 trillion debt. It's about $150,000 a family. And you don't see that money — you don't see — you don't see that debt, rather, but you're going to be paying the interest on it all your lives and then your kids are going to be paying for it. And you're going to wonder why it is government's taking so much, and a lot of it is just to pay for the interest on all this debt we're racking up. That's the wrong way to go.
He would also take us down a path like Europe, which means chronic high unemployment. They have high levels of unemployment and low wage growth, and their countries, as you know, are on the verge of — of fiscal collapse or fiscal calamity or crisis. That's the path that he's taking us on.
I'll take us on a very different course. I will help create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. [cheers and applause]
I will get us on track to a balanced budget. I'll restore personal freedom in part by getting rid of "Obamacare," returning to people the right they have to care for their own health care with their own physician. [cheers and applause]
And one more thing. This president's trying to make all the — all the number work by cutting in one place, and that's our military. [boos] That's the one place — [booing] — that's the one place he seems to be — he seems to be willing to take a pretty big meat cleaver to. He had his own budget, which cut the military, and then on top of that, he had this idea of a sequestration, which would cut it even more. He's cutting about a trillion dollars out of our military.
I — I hope you understand what's happened to the size of our military. You realize we have fewer ships in our Navy today than any time since 1917? [boos] And our Air Force is — is older and smaller in its fleet than any time since 1947, when it was formed.
And of course you know that our troops were stretched to the limit in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and yet he wants to shrink our number of troops, shrink our shipbuilding, shrink our purchases of aircraft.
I would take us in a very different direction. If I'm president of the United States, I will maintain a military second to none — [cheers and applause] — that is so strong no one would ever test it. We'll add to our Navy, to our Air Force and to our active duty personnel.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: One of the great experiences — one of the great experiences I've had in this campaign is meeting men and women who served in our military. I — I deeply respect and appreciate the sacrifice that they've made, and I particularly appreciate the sacrifice also of their families and those that have been lost and their families.
I wonder if those that are here today who've served in our military or are serving today would please raise their hand and be recognized. [cheers and applause] Wow.
This is a — this is a beautiful corner of God's — God's creation in this great country right here, but that wonderful line from one of our national hymns comes to mind, "O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life." I love our national heroes, the men and women of our armed forces. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [cheers and applause]
And so we face a critical time. We face a time when too many Americans are out of work, when too many Americans are tired of being tired. We face a time when our kids wonder whether the future will be bright as — bright for them as it has been for their parents. We face a time when there's tumult in the Middle East and other parts of the world, and people are asking, where's America?
Where is American leadership?
This is a critical time. If we were to reelect President Obama, I don't think we would measure up to the test of time.
I understand what it takes to restore the vitality of our economy, and that will allow us to restore the strength of our military and to continue to lead in the world. Liberty depends upon it.
I was at a celebration of Memorial Day in San Diego, a great military town, and I sat with a number of veterans from the Second World War. One of them who was standing there or sitting there was actually on the USS Tennessee on the day that their ship was attacked at Pearl Harbor. He was in the lookout post. He said he could actually lock eyes with the pilot bringing in the armament. He went on to serve for 33 more years in our U.S. Navy, even though he was injured in that attack. [cheers and applause]
The men and women like him in that greatest generation sacrificed enormously for us, for our prosperity and for our freedom. And they also held aloft a torch for the world to see — a torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. Now, there are not as many as there used to be in the greatest generation; and they're not as strong as they used to be, those who that are still with us — they can't hold the torch quite as high. It's our turn. It's our turn to grab that torch and lift it aloft. [cheers and applause] And we're going to to do it. [cheers and applause]
And I need your help to make sure we do it on November 6th. I need you guys to all vote. [cheers and applause] I need you to get your friends to vote. [cheers and applause] We need to take back America and keep America the shining city on the hill. [cheers and applause]
I love this great country. I believe in you. We're going to get America back and keep it so strong that the world is going to wonder at the great things we've achieved.
Thank you so very much — [cheers and applause] — and God bless Virginia, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks with Ann Romney at a Campaign Event in Apopka, Florida

October 6, 2012

MITT ROMNEY: That is a Florida welcome! Thank you so much! [applause] Thank you! You warm my heart, I've got to tell you. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: What an honor for us to be here with you this evening. How it humbles us to see so many people come out and care about our country so deeply that you'd spend your evening with Ann and me. I've brought someone special with me, as you can tell. This is a — [applause]. This is a young lady who went to the same elementary school I did. I didn't notice her then.
But when we got to high school and she was just about 16, we went to a party together. She was with someone else and I decided that I wanted to take her home with me, so I — or to her home rather, to take her off — [laughter]. Well, that was later. That was later. So I said to the guy that she came to the party with — I said, you know, I live closer to Ann than you do. Can I give her a ride home for you? And he said, sure. And we've been going steady ever since. My sweetheart, Ann Romney! [applause]
ANN ROMNEY: Wow! What a crowd! This is so — as Mitt said, it's very humbling to see so many people come out and believe in America. We believe in America. [applause] I think back of all of us that have had ancestors that have come to the shores of America with the promise of America. I had a grandfather that started working at age 6 in the coal mines of Wales. He came to America with nothing in his pocket but hope and dream. We have to do everything we can to keep that promise of America alive for all Americans. [applause]
I have seen Mitt in every capacity — as a husband, a father, a businessman, a governor, someone that ran the Olympics. And I will tell you something. This man does not fail. [applause] I can't wait to let him get the keys to the economic engine to drive this economy so that we can get better jobs for all of Americans because we care about all Americans. [applause] So let's hear from the next president of the United States. [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you! Thank you, Congressman Connie Mack, the next U.S. senator from Florida. Thank you, Connie. [applause] Thank you former congressman Artur Davis. What an extraordinary man and leader. And I appreciate his willingness to support my campaign and help me across America. Thank you, Artur. [applause] Thank you to one of the men that has co-chaired my effort here in Florida, your chief financial officer, Jeff Atwater. Thank you, Jeff.
Thank you to Congressman Dan Webster. He's going to get reelected by the good people in his district. Thank you. [applause] Now, you may have heard that earlier this week we were in Denver — Ann and I were. And I enjoyed the debate a good deal, I've got to tell you. [applause] It was an opportunity for me to express my own views on issues I care about deeply, to do so without the filter of the media or people deciding which clip to watch or not watch or even 30-second ads. But instead, I got to describe my vision for America.
And I was pleased that I had as positive a response as that which came. I was also pleased that I got to ask the president some questions I know people across America have wanted to ask him, like — [applause]. And for instance, with 23 million Americans out of work, why it was when he took office instead of focusing on jobs, he instead focused on "Obamacare." I asked him that question. I asked him another question. I asked him why it was with gasoline prices headed higher and higher, he cut back on the number of permits, well, both to drill onshore and offshore.
I got to ask him why it was that with our immigration system as broken as it is, why it was that he didn't do what he said he'd do in his first year, which was in his first year he said he'd put in place immigration reform policies that would deal with this issue and he didn't do that. That's a question I didn't ask in the last debate but I hope I'll get a chance in the next debate. [applause]
I got to ask him about that $90 billion he gave out to companies in the green energy world, places like Solyndra and Inter-One and Fisker and Tesla, some of whom were contributors to his campaign and pointed out that that $90 billion could have hired 2 million school teachers instead. [applause]
I got to ask given the fact that in the past he called the deficits under his predecessor un-American and unpatriotic, why it was that the deficits he put in place were twice as large. I got to ask why when he promised the people of America that he'd bring down your health insurance premiums by $2,500 he instead saw it go up by $2,500. So I asked him those questions and you heard his answers, or his non-answers. [applause]
And I guess the reason he had a hard time answering those particular questions was because — well, as something he said just the other day. He said, you know, you can't fix Washington from the inside. You can only fix it from the outside. We're going to give him that chance on November 6th. [applause] And there were places we agreed. He and I agreed that this was a critical election for the country. This is an election which will decide the course of America not just for four years but for a good deal longer.
This is not just a race between two individuals or even two parties. It's a race to define what America is going to be over the coming decades. The president has his vision, the place he'd take it. I have a different vision. Under his vision — [applause]. Under his vision, you're going to see higher and higher deficits adding up to larger and larger debt. In my view, that will kill the American dream. Instead, my vision is to balance our budget, get us on track to slow down government spending and make sure our kids have a bright and prosperous future. [applause]
Under his vision, he's going to raise taxes. The vice president blurted out the truth the other day. He said, you know, they're going to raise taxes a trillion dollars. And of course, if you count the "Obamacare" taxes, it's really $2 trillion they're planning on raising taxes.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: And then there was a study that was done just this last week in which they calculated how much interest there's going to be on the debt he's putting in place and they calculate because of all that interest expense and all the spending he's doing that he's going to also raise taxes on middle income families by an average of $40,000 per family. Look, my plan is not to raise taxes on anyone and I'm going to reduce taxes for middle income Americans. [applause]
And he made it very clear, of course, that he's planning on installing "Obamacare".
And by the way, the Congressional Budget Office has calculated that "Obamacare" will cost you about $2,500 more than a standard insurance policy. That's the additional cost to "Obamacare". By the way, he keeps promising all these wonderful things you'd get in "Obamacare" for free. Then he doesn't tell you that the policy's going to cost $2,500 a year more. So it's not for free. If I'm president, we're going to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with real health care reform. [applause]
And as you know, the president has made it clear that he's going to go ahead with $716 billion in cuts to Medicare. And by the way, that's $44 billion of cuts right here in Florida. And that would mean, incidentally, that 540,000 of our current Medicare beneficiaries — 540,000 of our seniors that have Medicare Advantage would lose Medicare Advantage here in Florida. My plan is to preserve and protect Medicare. I'll put that money back. [applause]
And I think — I think what was most striking about the president's comments was that when it came to jobs and the economy, he doesn't really have anything to add to what he's been doing over the last four years. I don't think we can afford four more years like the last four years. [applause] He in fact wants — he wants another stimulus. How'd that last stimulus work out? And of course, he's intent on having the government make investments, pick winners and losers — or in his case, losers. [applause]
And then, he wants to hire — he wants to hire more government workers. There's nothing wrong with people who work for our government. But that's not going to get this economy going. He's in favor of the status quo. And you understand what's happening in this country. Half the kids graduating from college can't find work or college level work. One out of six Americans has fallen into poverty. When he took office, 32 million Americans were on food stamps. Now, 47 million Americans are on food stamps.
Every year the median income in America has gone down. It's down $4,300 a family. And with average family income of around 50,000 bucks, that hurts. Gasoline prices are up twice what they used to be. These are tough years for the middle class and for the poor in America. If we calculated, by the way, our unemployment rate in a way that was consistent with the way it was calculated when he came into office, it'd be a different number.
You see, if the number of people — if the percentage of the American population that were in the workforce were the same today as the day he was elected, our unemployment rate would be above 11 percent. This is inexcusable in a nation that's so prosperous as ours that four years of a presidency has not been able to get America back on track. He can't. He doesn't know how. I know how and I will get the job done. [applause]
I will do — I will do five things. I will do five things that will get this economy humming again. Number one, I'm going to take full advantage of our coal, our oil, our gas, our nuclear and our renewables. [applause] All those permits and licenses the president's cut back on, I'm going to double and I'm going to open up Alaska for us to be able to get oil from there too. [applause] And we're going to build that pipeline from Canada if I have to do it myself. [applause]
That's going to create about 3-1/2 to 4 million jobs, taking advantage of our energy, not just energy jobs but other jobs that are in manufacturing and that use energy. We're going to bring those jobs back home. Number two, I want more trade, particularly with Latin America. I'm going to push for more free trade so we can sell our goods around the world. But by the way, if nations cheat — and China has cheated — I'm going to stop it. We've got to put a stop to this kind of cheating. [applause]
Number three — number three, we have to have training programs that prepare our workers today for the jobs of today and schools that prepare our kids for the jobs of tomorrow. And for that to be the case — well, let me tell you. Right now, there are 47 different federal job training programs, 47. They report to eight different agencies. There's so much overhead and overlapping responsibility. I want to do this. I want to take all that money and I want to give Florida its fair share and say you create the programs that work best for your own people. [applause]
And education — education, Florida can teach the nation some lessons on education. Jeb Bush, what a great governor. He was serious on education. [applause] He made sure that schools are graded A through F so parents know which schools are working and which ones aren't. He made sure that — and I'm going to do the same thing, by the way. I want all our schools across the nation to be graded A through F so parents know which schools are good or not.
And then he also gave parents more choice here. If a school was failing, kids were able to go to a school of their choice. The federal government sends out a lot of money to schools — IDEA money, Title I money for disabled and poor kids. I want to make sure those dollars don't just go to states and school districts. I want them to go to the kids, if you will, so the parents are able to choose the school their child goes to. We have to put the children and the parents and the teachers first and the teachers union behind. [applause]
Number four — number four, I've already mentioned it. You're not going to get entrepreneurs to risk their life savings to start a business or companies to come to Florida or other states and expand and hire more people if they think we're on the road to Greece. And let me tell you, if this president keeps spending a trillion dollars or more — or more than we take in, than we take in every year — you're going to see us on the road to Greece and you're going to see a financial crisis down the road. I will not let that happen. I will cut federal spending and I will get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause]
And number five — number five, there is one sector of the private sector that's created two-thirds of American jobs over the last 15 years. And this is the sector I'll champion — small business. We have to have small business. [applause] Small businesses is a source of jobs. It's also a great source of opportunity. Hispanic Americans are even more active in starting new businesses than the population at large. We need to help people with small business. That means keeping taxes down on small business, getting regulators to encourage them and making sure we get rid of "Obamacare." It kills jobs and small business. [applause]
Now, I want you to know how confident I am in the future of this country. I have seen the American spirit. Throughout my life, throughout this campaign, I've met people who epitomized what it is that makes America seem such a unique place and such an exceptional nation. We're an entrepreneurial people. We're a hardworking people. We'd rather work than take vacations. I know some people, they take vacations and they're out there doing something every minute. They just want to be going all the time. It's part of our national spirit. We work hard.
And we — and we're always looking for opportunities to start things and fix things and improve things. It's just who we are. But one of the things I love most about this country is the great quality of the human spirit — our patriotism for America. I've seen it everywhere I've gone [applause] I had the thrill of going over to Afghanistan and Iraq when I was still serving as governor. Both conflicts were going on at that point. And I went from base to base and I'd say hello to the troops that were from my home state in Massachusetts. And I'd — there's someone from Massachusetts. Hi, out there.
And I'd say to them, by the way, if you'd like me to call your mom or your dad when I get home, take out — or your spouse, take out a piece of paper and write down their name and telephone number and I'll call them when I get home. Well, by the time I left the area — Iraq and Afghanistan — I had 63 pieces of paper in my pocket. And I thought, this is going to take a while to make it through all these calls.
I got home the night before Memorial Day. And on Memorial Day morning, I thought before the kids get up and we spend some time together with the family, I'll make a few calls and just get this started. On about the second or third call, the woman that answered the phone said, oh, Governor Romney, I thought that might be you calling. [laughter]
And I said, what do you mean? And she said, well, you know, you made some calls this morning to some spouses and then they emailed, you know, their soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan saying you were calling and they emailed each others — each other. And so, we've been expecting your call today. [laughter]
So I made 63 calls on Memorial Day. [applause] And you know, I was a little concerned about the calls because this was before the surge in Iraq and before we'd been so successful in our military action there.
And I expected that some of them would say what some politicians were saying, that we had lost in Iraq, we should divide the country in three or whatever. And I thought some would say why is my loved one still there, can't they come home.
In 63 calls, not one complaint, not one, and in each call — [applause] — in each call I would end with roughly these words: on behalf of our country and on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I want to express my appreciation to you for the sacrifice of your family and the sacrifice of your loved one for our great country. And they would either interrupt me or wait until I was finished and say roughly these words: no, Governor, it's an honor to be able to sacrifice for the greatest nation on Earth. [applause]
I love our patriotism. I love the spirit of America. I love the hearts of our fellow citizens. I saw a classmate of mine just a few weeks ago in Atlanta at an event. This classmate was a very successful businessperson and then he was involved in a tragic accident which left him paralyzed from the neck down. And I went to an event. It was hot and a lot of people there crowding around. But I looked back and I saw kind of a space in the crowd. And I looked carefully and there was Billy Hulce. He'd come to my event.
It touched my heart to see him there and they pushed his wheelchair forward and he came up and I reached over and put my arm on his shoulder and I whispered into his ear. And I said: Billy, I love you and God bless you. And Billy was an inspiration to me in the things he had done up until that point because even though he lost his mobility, he stayed active, active in his business, active in spinal cord research doing everything he could to try and help other people from experiencing the suffering he'd had.
So I was happy to put my hand on his shoulder and thank him and express my love to him and ask God to bless him. And he — [applause]. I got a — I got a call from a friend that he died the next day after that visit. It's rare that you get a chance to tell someone how much you love them when you still can. I thought back to a time a little earlier in my life when I was serving as the pastor in my congregation. And I'd been visiting a family, the Oparowski family. You may have seen them speak at the Republican Convention.
Ted Oparowski, firefighter for the Medford police department, his wife Pat and two sons. And David was about 14-years-old. He became afflicted with leukemia. And I spent time with David. I'd visit with him. We became more and more friendly. I asked him what would he like more than anything else in the world. He said fireworks. So I bought some and we had a big box of fireworks and helped him light them off. And on one occasion, he brought me into his bedroom while he was still at home. And he said: Mitt, what happens next? And I talked to him about what I believe about life hereafter.
And then, as he was really ill and in the hospital, he called one day and I think either he called directly or Pat, his mom, called and said: David wants you. You got a law degree, right? I said, yes. I'm not a practicing lawyer but I have a law degree. And she said or he said: Would you come to the hospital. He wants to dictate his will to you. And so I went to the hospital and got out my legal pad to make it look official and said: David, what do you want to do.
And he said: Well, I want my fishing rod to go to one friend and I want my skateboard to go to another friend and I want my rifle to go to my brother and through all this, David had a kind of strength and courage and maturity you see in so many of our young people and so many of the people in this great nation of ours. I thought of that wonderful slogan some years later: clear eyes, full heart, can't lose. David passed away but I'll always remember and never forget his courage, his clear eyes, his full heart, he won't lose. [applause]
One more — one more experience that will underscore the greatness of the human spirit, the greatness of this great land of ours. And this was at the Republican Convention. I met someone named Jane Horton. Jane also suffered tragedy in her life. Her husband Christopher was serving in Afghanistan on the day she was packing up a care package to go to him for his birthday when the knock came at the door that he'd been tragically killed there. And what did she do? She didn't fall into a sadness and a despair but instead went to work to help other families that had lost loved ones and served our nation.
She went to the funeral for her husband when his remains came back of course. And this was at a time when that misguided group who was protesting at funerals of our servicemen.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: And she was asked what do you think about these people protesting at your husband's funeral? And she said this, and I quote, "Chris died for them to be able to protest." This is quite a nation we live in. [applause] I love those who serve our country. I love that verse from one of our national hymns: O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Would our veterans and members of the Armed Forces please raise your hand and please be recognized? [applause] Thank you.
I believe in America. I believe in you. I believe our future is bright because I believe in the greatness of the American spirit. We're going to overcome the challenges we have. I'm counting on Florida to win this for me on November 6th so that we can take back this country and make it strong again. [applause] I love this nation! We're going to win in Florida! We're going to win across the country! We're going to get America back on the path that it needs to be to have a bright and prosperous future. Thank you so very much! You're the best! Thank you! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks with Ann Romney at a Campaign Event in Port St. Lucie, Florida

October 7, 2012

[cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you. Thank you Thank you.
AUDIENCE: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Congressman West, and thank you, Attorney General Bondi. Your welcome here today has warmed Ann and my heart. This is a — an extraordinary sight to see all of you gathered here today in Port St. Lucie. We're going to win Florida. We're going to take back the White House. [cheers and applause]
Now, I have with me today someone who I met in elementary school. I didn't notice her terribly much in elementary school, but I did notice her when she was just about 16, in high school. We went to a party at a friend's house, and she went with someone else. I happened to see her there. I went to the fellow she came with and I said, look, I live closer to Ann's house than you do; why don't I give her a ride home for you? (Laughter, cheers.) And he agreed, and we've been going steady ever since. Please say hi to the next first lady, Ann Romney. [cheers and applause]
ANN ROMNEY: I get — I get the feeling when I look out at this crowd that we are going to win Florida. [cheers and applause]
I've spent many wonderful winters in — Christmastime especially, down here, escaping the cold of Boston, when my parents were living in Stuart, Florida.
[cheers and applause] And my brother also lived in Stuart for about 10 years, so I'm very familiar with this part of the country. It's a great and wonderful place.
And you folks are going to make all the difference in the future of this country by voting in November to replace Barack Obama. [cheers and applause]
We've come off a great week, a great debate, a great convention. And the one thing that I've appreciated more than anything else at the convention and also at the debate was a chance for the American to people — what the chance they got to see my husband as I see him: a good and decent person — [cheers and applause] — that throughout his life has exhibited his care for others. And now we're going to get a chance for him to really care for others because we're going to have the chance to see him get people back to work again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. So I'm thrilled to be here. What an honor it is. And thank you all very much. And I'll let you hear from the next president of the United States. [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Ann.
You know — [cheers] — we had a little debate earlier this week, and I enjoyed myself. [cheers and applause] This was a — this was a good opportunity for the president and I to talk to each other about the issues that people care about. It was a debate of substance. The — the moderator, Jim Lehrer, I thought, did a nice job of raising topics for us to each discuss. And we spoke about those things. I got the chance to ask — or to ask some of the questions that people across America have wanted to ask the president.
I asked him, for instance, why it was that with 23 million Americans out of work or struggling to find a good job, he spent his first two years fighting for "Obamacare" instead of fighting for them. And — (mixed cheers and boos, applause) — I — I got to ask him why it was, was gasoline prices almost twice as high as when he took office, he spent his time cutting in half the number of permits and licenses for drilling oil and gas in this country. I got to ask him as well why, with — with huge deficits, he spent $90 billion investing in companies like Solyndra. I got to — [booing] — I — I got to ask him why, with —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Criminals!
MR. ROMNEY: — with this — with him having said in the past that these levels of deficits that he'd seen in the past were considered un-American by him, why he doubled those deficits and put in place almost as much debt held by the public as all the prior presidents combined. And then of course I had one last question, and that was why it was that when he ran for office, he promised that by this year, health insurance premiums would be down by $2,500 a family, but instead, they're up by $2,500 a family. [boos] And don't — don't forget, with the median family income in America at $50,000 a year, that $5,000 difference is a huge difference to the American people.
And so I'm convinced that you all had the chance to hear his — his answers or his nonanswers. [laughter] Now, of course, days later we're hearing his excuses. And next January we'll be watching him leave the White House for the last time. [cheers and applause]
Now, we did — we did agree in some areas. One area we agreed upon was that we're going to take two very different views about where America would go. My path is very different than the path that he would pursue. His path, for instance, would continue to raise deficits larger. We'd have deficits of a trillion dollars a year for each of the next four years. That would lead to national debt of roughly $20 trillion. I'm convinced that would crush the American dream for our children. I think it's both wrong economically; I think it's immoral. My path is instead to cut federal spending, to cap federal spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
Now, he also made it very clear they plan on raising taxes. You — you probably heard the vice president. He blurted out the truth again this week. And — [laughter] — he said they're — they are in fact going to raise taxes by a trillion dollars. Actually, with "Obamacare," it really becomes $2 trillion. That of course will make it harder for small businesses to hire people and to employ people. It'll make it harder for middle-income families.
By the way, a study came out this week that showed with all his spending and all his borrowing and all the interest on that debt that he will ultimately have to raise taxes on middle-income families by $4,000 a year.
This commitment I make to you: I will not raise taxes on middle-class families. [cheers and applause]
He will — if he is re-elected, he will install "Obamacare" and with it your premiums are going to go up an extra $2,500 above what they already are in your current health care plan. [boos]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No!
MR. ROMNEY: That's according to the Congressional Budget Office.
My plan is that I will finally get control of the excessive costs in health care by repealing and replacing "Obamacare" with real reforms. [cheers and applause]
And then you see that big sign behind me. Well, you could kind of see that big sign behind me. [laughter] You saw it earlier. The president admitted that under "Obamacare," under his plan, he is cutting $716 billion from Medicare. [boos] And by the way, that accounts to — for $44 billion right here in Florida. It would mean that 540,000 Floridians would lose Medicare Advantage. [boos]
I can tell you this: When Paul Ryan is elected vice president, I'm elected president, we'll restore that money to Medicare and honor the promise made to our seniors. [cheers and applause]
And then — then there was his jobs plan. He was asked how he'd get the economy going and he basically said it's the status quo. He's going to keep doing what he's been doing. He wants another stimulus. How'd the first one work out? [boos] He — he wants to hire more government workers. He wants to pick winners and losers between Solyndra and so — actually, losers, in his case — [laughter] — and we know where that leads. We've seen the last four years. We don't want four more years like the last four years. [cheers and applause]
I have a plan. I have a plan that takes advantage of the extraordinary opportunity that exists in America right now, that's going to get this economy going and create jobs, jobs and more jobs — 12 million jobs, in specific.
And they are, number, one take advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. [cheers and applause] The estimate is that we'll get 3.5 (million) to 4 million new jobs, not just in the energy sector but also in manufacturing and other sectors as our energy is low-cost and abundant. That's number one.
Number two, we're going to make trade work for us by opening up markets, particularly in Latin America. And we're going to crack down on any nation that cheats on trade like China's been cheating. [cheers and applause]
Number three, we're going to make sure our workers have the skills they need to succeed, so we're going to take our training programs and — programs in Washington, of which there are 47 that report to eight agencies. Think of all the overhead and the waste. I'm going to take the money that comes from that, I'm going to give Florida its fair share and say, Florida, you train your people in the way you think best for the jobs in Florida. [cheers and applause]
And — and for the skills of tomorrow, we've got to makes sure that people across this country learn some of the lessons that have been taught right here in Florida by your great governor Jeb Bush. He did a great job in education. [cheers and applause]
He grades schools in Florida, A through F, so you know which schools are doing well and which are not, and if a school fails consistently, why, then kids are given a choice to go to another school. We're going to make sure that nationally we grade our schools and we finally give parents and children the choice to choose their own school. And by the way, the key to education is going to be this: Put the kids and their parents and the teachers first, and teachers union behind. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Romney — [inaudible].
MR. ROMNEY: Number four, you're not going to get — you're not going to get small businesses to grow and thrive or big businesses to grow if they think we're on the road to Greece, and that's why it's so critical that we finally balance our budget. I'll do that.
And number five, one more, we have to champion small business. That's where jobs come from. [cheers and applause] We've got to help small-business people. I'm going to keep their taxes down. The president's tax plan will kill 700,000 jobs, mostly in small business. My plan will help create 7 million jobs — my tax plan. I'm going to keep the taxes down on small business. I'm going to get regulators to encourage small business, not crush them. And we're going to take that big cloud that kills jobs away from small business. We're going to get rid of "Obamacare." [cheers and applause] These things will get this economy going.
Now I'm optimistic. I want you to know that great days are ahead. America's greatest days are not in the past. It may be a little cloudy today, but the sunshine is coming through, guys — [cheers and applause] — for this country. I've had the occasion throughout my life to see something about the — the great qualities of the human spirit exhibited in the American people time and time again.
I know something about great human beings in this country. It's that that gives me the confidence that our future will be so bright, because I've seen how Americans respond to challenge and even to tragedy.
I was — I was in Atlanta for an event not terribly long ago. And — and one of my classmates from business school was there. He had been involved in an accident a few years ago and had become quadriplegic — could only move his — his face and mouth. And — and he has to be moved around in a wheelchair. And yet he, on a hot day, had made the effort to — to be there in a crowd, to — to cheer one of his classmates.
And it touched my heart to see him. I — I motioned to him to come forward. I saw a — a parting where he was coming through, people moving aside so they could get his — his chair up close to the front, and he came up. And I put my hand on his shoulder. And I recalled all that he'd been doing over the last several years. Despite — despite his great tragedy, he'd stayed involved in his businesses and had devoted himself to spinal — spinal cord research so that other people wouldn't suffer the same kind of tragic loss of — of his ability as — as he had suffered.
So I put my hand on his shoulder, and I — and I reached over, and I said, Billy , I love you, and God bless you. It was a great occasion to say hi to my good friend. And he passed away the next day.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Oh!
MR. ROMNEY: And — and I thought, what a blessing it was for me to see him on that last — on that last day and acknowledge to him my respect for him.
It reminded me of an experience I had some years before. I was serving as a pastor in my congregation at church. And a — and a — a young fellow ward named David Obrowski — his parents from Medford, Massachusetts, his dad a firefighter, his mom, a stay-at-home mom. They raised their two sons. But at age 14 David contracted leukemia and became very, very ill. It was clear that — that there was no good conclusion to this leukemia. It was very severe and fast-moving.
I — I used to visit their home regularly. And one — one day he asked me to come into his room without his parents. And I sat down next to him. And he said — he said, what happens next? And I spoke with him about what I believe happens next. And some weeks later when he was in the hospital and — and things were quite severe, he got in touch with me and asked me if I'd come to the hospital.
He said, you know, you're — you went to law school, right? And I said, yes. He said, I — I'd like you to write a will for me. And — and so I got a big piece of legal pad, and — and he proceeded to describe the things he wanted to give away: his stakeboard, his fishing rod, who that'd go to, and, of course, his rifle to his brother.
This is a boy who had courage. I didn't see him waiver. I saw strength in his eyes. I was reminded some years later when I saw that — that vision on TV: clear eyes, full heart, can't lose. David can't lose. I love the greatness of the soul of the American people.
I — I was at the Republican convention here just a few weeks ago in Tampa and got a chance to — to meet a young woman named Jane Horton from Oklahoma. Her husband went off to serve in Afghanistan. And on the day she was packaging up a birthday package for him, she received a knock at the door and was told that her husband had been killed there.
At the — at the funeral for her husband, there were those misguided protesters — remember that, when these protesters — (jeers) — would show up at the funerals of — of our servicemen and women — and — and came to that service for her husband. And — and people asked her, the media asked her, what do you think about these people protesting at your husband's funeral? And she said this, and I quote, Chris died for them to be able to protest. [cheers and applause] This is — this is our nation. (This is ?) the American people. I've seen the heart of the American people.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: I love this country. I love those people. I believe in America. I believe in you. I believe in our fellow citizens. I believe we're going to take back this country and make it strong again, do what we have to do to provide a bright future for our families. [cheers and applause]
And I commit to you this: I will do everything in my power to draw on that greatness of the American people to make us more united as a people, to have us pull together, to reach across the aisle and find good Democrats in the House and the Senate that care deeply about America just as I do. I know they're there. I know they'll work together if they have leadership that will actually work and share credit and find ways to solve our great challenges. I know that's going to happen. I'm looking forward to the chance to be in Washington as a leader to get America on track again. I commit to you I will keep this nation strong. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: I love the strength of this country, the greatness of our heart, the greatness of those who serve — our men and women in military. Would all those who are veterans or those that are active duty please raise your hand and be recognized by the audience — wow. [cheers and applause]
I love those words in one of our national hymns: "O beautiful for heroes prov'd, In liberating strife, Who more than self their country lov'd, And mercy more than life." This is a great nation.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen.
MR. ROMNEY: I was in Poland a few weeks ago and got to meet with Lech Walesa, a world hero. I came in; he said, Mr. Romney, you've come a long distance. You sit. I'll talk. You listen. [laughter]
So I did. [laughter] I sat down and he said this: Where's American leadership? The world needs American leadership. [cheers] America is the only superpower on the planet; we need America to lead. And then he spoke about various places in the world, and each description of one place or another he would reiterate, where's American leadership?
I commit to you: I will be a leader. When I'm president, I will take the care that it takes to rebuild our principles and restore the principles that made America so strong. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: I will do what it takes to restore a strong — a strong and vibrant economy that can care for our families and can care for a military second to none. And I will keep our military so strong no one would ever think of testing it. [cheers and applause]
This is our time. This is our time.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is your time!
MR. ROMNEY: This is a time for all of us together.
I was at Memorial Day — I was in San Diego, a great — a great military town, a Navy town, a Marine town, and I was there for the celebration of Memorial Day. I was on a state giving a speech, and there were three or four — I think four members of the armed services, veterans who had served in the Second World War.
The one closest to me had been the lookout on the USS Tennessee in Pearl Harbor on the day of the attack. He said his eyes locked on the eyes of the pilot bringing in the armament that would hit their ships. He was injured in the blast, but went on to serve for 33 more years in the U.S. Navy.
And — [cheers and applause] — these men and women in the greatest generation are not as many as there used to be. They're getting older. And they can't hold the torch as high as they used to hold it — the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. They held it for us. They held it for the world to see.
But now it's our turn. We have to take that torch and hold it aloft, and we will together. I need you to go out there and find people that'll come join our cause and help us get this country back on track again. [cheers and applause] We're going to make that happen; we're going to hold that torch high — very, very high. On November 6th, the world is going to see we're serious about coming back, about strengthening the basis of this great country. [cheers and applause] We're taking back the White House, we're taking back America, we're going to keep this nation strong. I need your help. We're going to win in Florida. We're taking back the White House. [cheers and applause]
Thank you so very much. Thank you! [cheers and applause]

Remarks on Foreign Policy at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia: "The Mantle of Leadership"

October 8, 2012

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very much for that warm welcome. And I particularly appreciate the introduction by my good friend and tireless campaign companion, Governor Bob McDonnell. We have traveled the state together time and time again, and he goes all over the country helping me. He is also showing here in Virginia what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy.
And thank you also to Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. I appreciate his service and leadership. And particular thanks to General Peay. I appreciate his invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute. It's a — a privilege to be here at an institution like this that has done so much for our nation, both in times of war and in times of peace.
For more than 170 years VMI has done more than educate students. It has guided their transformation into citizens, warriors and leaders. VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and in other lands. And since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates who are right now serving in harm's way. May God bless all who serve and all who have served.
Of all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished, perhaps, than General George Marshall, the chief of staff of the Army who became secretary of state and secretary of defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war. General Marshall once said, quote, "the only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it."
Those words were true in his time, and they are true in our time.
Last month our nation was attacked again. A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead, murdered in Benghazi, Libya. Among the dead were three veterans. All of them were fine men on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that clearly longs for both. President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America, and he's right. We all mourn their loss.
The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident. They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia. Our embassies have been attacked. Our flag has been burned. Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs shouting "Death to America." These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of 9/11.
As the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown worse and what this calls on America to do. These are the right questions, and I've come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events and to share with you and to share with all Americans my vision for a freer, more prosperous and more peaceful world.
The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They're expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East, a region that's now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century. And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself.
The attack on our consulate there on September 11th, 2012, was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001.
This latest assault can't be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially on women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.
We saw all of this in Benghazi last month, but we also saw something else, something hopeful. After the attack on our consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who had murdered our people. They waved signs that read, "The ambassador was Libya's friend" and "Libya is sorry." They chanted "No to militias, no to militias." They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound and then they burned it to the ground. As one Libyan woman said, "We are not going to go from darkness to darkness."
This is the struggle that's now shaken the entire Middle East. It's the struggle of millions and millions of people — men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and nonbelievers — all of whom have had enough of the darkness. It's a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom and opportunity and the right to live under laws of our own making. It's a struggle that's been unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya, and now in Syria.
In short, it's a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair.
We've seen this struggle before. It would be familiar to General George Marshall. In his time, the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism. Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts.
Statesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world. We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets. We defended our friends and ourselves from our common enemies. We led. We led. And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century.
This is what makes America exceptional: It is not only the character of our country; it is also the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership — a history that's been written by patriots of both parties. That is America at its best and is the standard by which we measure every president as well as anyone who wishes to be president.
Unfortunately, this president's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership. And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.
I want to be very clear: The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out — no one else. But it is our responsibility and the responsibility of the President to use America's great power to shape history, not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events.
Unfortunately, that's exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama.
The relationship between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel, for example, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The president explicitly stated that his goal was to put daylight between the United States and Israel, and he's succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.
Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability. It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies and to us. And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year, when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in our nation's capital. And yet when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009; when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world; when they cried out, are you with us or are you with them, the American president was silent.
Across the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces and growing economies and developing effective democratic institutions, the president has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need.
In Iraq the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent al-Qaida, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad and the rising influence of Iran. And yet America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence.
The president's tried, he tried, but he also failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.
The president has also failed to lead in Syria, where more than — more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight. Our ally Turkey has been attacked. And the conflict threatens stability in the region.
America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. These are real achievements won at a high cost. Al-Qaida remains a strong force, however, in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region. Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East.
The president is fond of saying that "the tide of war is receding." And I want to believe him as much as anyone else. But when we look at the Middle East today, with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threatening to destabilize the region and with violent extremists on the march, and with an American ambassador and three others dead — likely at the hands of al-Qaida affiliates — it's clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the president took office.
I know the president hopes for a safer, freer and more prosperous Middle East allied with us. I share this hope. But hope is not a strategy. We can't support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.
The greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East — friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists and evil tyrants and angry mobs who seek to harm us. Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our president is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, "We will not forget that you forgot about us."
It is time to change course in the Middle East. That course should be organized around these bedrock principles: America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them. No enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them. And no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words.
I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran and will — and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf. And I'll work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions, not just words, that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.
I'll reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security. The world must never see any daylight between our two nations.
I'll deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf, and I'll roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I'll make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure.
The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow. The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war.
The size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916. I'll restore our Navy to the size needed to fulfill our missions by building 15 ships per year, including three submarines. I'll implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. And on this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. And I will call on our NATO allies to keep the greatest military alliance in history strong by honoring their commitment to each devote 2 percent of their GDP to security spending. Today only three of the 28 NATO nations meet this benchmark.
I'll make further reforms to our foreign assistance to create incentives for good governance, for free enterprise and for greater trade in the Middle East and beyond. I'll organize all assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with responsibility and accountability to prioritize efforts and to produce results.
I'll rally our friends and our allies to match our generosity with theirs. And I'll make it clear to the recipients of our aid that in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent, modern government: to respect the rights of all of their citizens, including women and minorities; to ensure space for civil society, a free media, political parties and an independent judiciary; and to abide by their international commitments to protect our diplomats and our property.
I'll champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world. The president has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years. I'll reverse that failure. I'll work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones.
I'll support friends across the Middle East who share our values but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies.
In Libya I'll support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I'll vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed our fellow Americans.
In Egypt I'll use our influence, including clear conditions on our aid, to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid.
In Syria I'll work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and then ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks helicopters and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously through our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran, rather than sitting on the sidelines. It's essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.
In Afghanistan I'll pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014.
President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to war and to potential attacks here at home is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11. I'll evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to protect my political prospects but to protect the security of the nation.
Finally, I'll recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the president has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new president will bring the chance to begin anew.
There's a longing for American leadership in the Middle East — and it's not unique to that region. It's broadly felt by America's friends and allies in other parts of the world as well: in Europe, where Putin's Russia casts a long shadow over young democracies and where our oldest allies have been told we are "pivoting" away from them; in Asia and across the Pacific, where China's recent assertiveness is sending chills throughout that region; and here in our own hemisphere, where our neighbors in Latin America want to resist the failed ideology of Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers and deepen ties with the United States on trade and energy and security. But in all of these places, just as in the Middle East, the question is asked: Where does America stand?
I know many Americans are asking a different question: Why us? I know many Americans are asking whether our country today, with our ailing economy and our massive debt and after 11 years at war, is still capable of leading.
I believe that if America doesn't lead, others will — others who don't share our interests and our values — and the world would grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years. I'm running for president because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens and to our friends everywhere, to use America's great influence, wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively, to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict and make the world better — not perfect but better.
Our friends and allies across the globe don't want less American leadership. They want more — more of our moral support, more of our security cooperation, more of our trade, more of our assistance in building free societies and thriving economies. So many people across the world still look to America as the best hope of humankind. So many people still have faith in America. We must show them that we still have faith in ourselves; that we have the will and the wisdom to revive our stagnant economy, to roll back our unsustainable debt, to reform our government, to reverse the catastrophic cuts now threatening our national defense, to renew the sources of our great power and to lead the course of human events.
Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall: "He always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement and disillusion."
That's the role our friends want America to play again, and it's the role we must play.
The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror and war and economic calamity. It's our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom and peace and prosperity. The torch America carries is one of decency and hope. It's not America's torch alone, but it is America's duty and honor to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light.
Thank you so much for your participation in this great charge. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. [applause]
NOTE: Above are the remarks as delivered. Below are the remarks as prepared for delivery.
"I particularly appreciate the introduction from my good friend and tireless campaign companion, Gov. Bob McDonnell.  He is showing what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy.  Thank you also Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. And particular thanks to Gen. Peay. I appreciate your invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute.  It is a great privilege to be here at an Institution that has done so much for our nation, both in war and in peace.
For more than 170 years, VMI has done more than educate students.  It has guided their transformation into citizens, and warriors, and leaders.  VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and other lands.  Since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates and all Americans who are now serving in harm's way.  May God bless all who serve, and all who have served.
Of all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished than George Marshall—the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war.
General Marshall once said, "The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it."  Those words were true in his time—and they still echo in ours.
Last month, our nation was attacked again.  A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead—murdered in Benghazi, Libya.  Among the dead were three veterans.  All of them were fine men, on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that dearly longs for both.  President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America.  And he is right.  We all mourn their loss.
The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident.  They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia.  Our embassies have been attacked.  Our flag has been burned.  Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting "Death to America." These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.
As the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown so much worse, and what this calls on America to do.  These are the right questions.  And I have come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events—and to share with you, and all Americans, my vision for a freer, more prosperous, and more peaceful world. 
The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts.  They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East—a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century.  And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself.
The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long.  No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West. 
We saw all of this in Benghazi last month—but we also saw something else, something hopeful.  After the attack on our Consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who murdered our people.  They waved signs that read, "The Ambassador was Libya's friend" and "Libya is sorry." They chanted "No to militias."  They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound.  Then they burned it to the ground.  As one Libyan woman said, "We are not going to go from darkness to darkness."
This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation.  It is the struggle of millions and millions of people—men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and non-believers—all of whom have had enough of the darkness.  It is a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom, and opportunity, and the right to live under laws of our own making.  It is a struggle that has unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Libya, and now Syria.  In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair.
We have seen this struggle before.  It would be familiar to George Marshall.  In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism.  Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values, and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts.
Statesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world.  We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets.  We defended our friends, and ourselves, from our common enemies.  We led.  And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century.
This is what makes America exceptional:  It is not just the character of our country—it is the record of our accomplishments.  America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership—a history that has been written by patriots of both parties.  That is America at its best.  And it is the standard by which we measure every President, as well as anyone who wishes to be President. Unfortunately, this President's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership.  And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East. 
I want to be very clear:  The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out—no one else.  But it is the responsibility of our President to use America's great power to shape history—not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events.  Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama.
The relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put "daylight" between the United States and Israel.  And he has succeeded.  This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.
Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability.  It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and to us.  And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation's capital.  And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, "Are you with us, or are you with them?"—the American President was silent.
Across the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces, and growing economies, and developing democratic institutions, the President has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need. 
In Iraq, the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent Al-Qaeda, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad, and the rising influence of Iran. And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried—and failed—to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.
The President has failed to lead in Syria, where more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight.  Our ally Turkey has been attacked.  And the conflict threatens stability in the region.
America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.  These are real achievements won at a high cost.  But Al-Qaeda remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region.  Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East.
The President is fond of saying that "The tide of war is receding."  And I want to believe him as much as anyone.  But when we look at the Middle East today—with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threating to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march, and with an American Ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of Al-Qaeda affiliates— it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the President took office.
I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope.  But hope is not a strategy.  We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity. 
The greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East—friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us.  Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our President is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, "We will not forget that you forgot about us."
It is time to change course in the Middle East.  That course should be organized around these bedrock principles:  America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them... no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them... and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words.
I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region—and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination.  For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions—not just words—that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.
I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security—the world must never see any daylight between our two nations.
I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf.
And I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure.  The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow.  The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war.

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Newport News, Virginia

October 8, 2012

Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Wow.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: You know — thank you, Governor McDonnell, one of the great leaders that you have here. And by the way, if people want to know what a conservative can do to help build an economy, they can just look here in Virginia. This is a great governor doing a great job. Thanks a lot. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
And people wonder why is it I'm so confident we're going to win. I'm confident because I see you here on a day like this. This is unbelievable. Thank you so much. [cheers and applause]
Now, you may have noticed this. Earlier in the week we had a debate. That was last week. And — [cheers and applause] — that was a — that was a good debate. I enjoyed that debate, and — [cheers and applause] — there were some places where we agreed and some places we disagreed. Some of the places that we agreed were — were associated with the fact that we would take America in different directions. The president has his path. I have a path I take (that are ?) very, very different. And I — I'm not going to go through all this in great detail because you've been here a little while in this — in this — this sunshine. [laughter] What I want to do — I want to remind you of some of the places that are very, very different that we'd go.
Number one, he would continue to spend a trillion dollars more than we take in every year. In my view, that's immoral and wrong. [boos] If I'm president of the United States, I will cut federal spending, I'll cap it and finally get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
And, you know, if he's re-elected, why, he's going to install "Obamacare." And if he installs "Obamacare," your health insurance is going to cost $2,500 a year more than it would otherwise. And — and I know he likes to tell you all the free things you're going to get with "Obamacare," except it costs $2,500 more. And then you're going to have government bureaucrats in the doctor's office with you. If I'm elected president, we'll get the bureaucrats out, we're going to go back (to have a nation ?) which is not run by "Obamacare." (We'll have ?) "Obamacare" be repealed and replaced by real health care reform that helps hold down cost. [cheers and applause]
He has promised that if he's re-elected, why, he's going to cut Medicare for seniors, today's seniors, by $716 billion. [boos]
If I'm elected, I will honor the promise to our seniors and restore that money back into Medicare. [cheers and applause]
This president also has made it very clear if he's re-elected, why, he's going to continue to cut the military. His — [booing] — his budget plan and sequestration plan would take the military spending down by a trillion dollars. That would cut jobs in Virginia by approximately 200,000 people.
If I'm elected, I will restore funding to our military budget. I will not cut our military commitment. [cheers and applause]
And — and then of course there's jobs. He was given the opportunity in the debate to describe what he'd do to create jobs. And I didn't hear anything new. It was very clear he plans on four more years like the last four years. I don't think we can afford four more years like the last four years. [boos]
You know, he wants another stimulus. How'd that first one work out? [laughter]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: And then — then he wants to pick winners and losers among companies — or losers, in his case — and then — [laughter] — then of course he — he wants to hire more government workers. Look, all of these things have not ignited our economy the way it should be ignited. We see the slowest recovery from a recession in history. As a matter of fact, I just read that if you look back 60 years and you look at all of the months we had with unemployment above 8 percent before President Obama, there were 39 months in all 60 years with unemployment above 8 percent. Under this president there have been 43 months, under one president alone. He does not understand what it takes to create a real recovery. I do. I will do five things that'll get this economy going again.
Number one, we're going to take full advantage of our oil, our coal, our natural gas, our nuclear and renewables.
[cheers and applause]
Number two, I'll make sure we get trade that works for up, open up new markets for trade and crack down on China — [inaudible] — when they cheat. [cheers and applause]
Number three, I'm going to make sure our training programs work for the workers of today and get our — our kids the education they need. I'm going to make sure that our parents and our kids and the teachers, they come first, and the teachers union will have to come behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four, I will — [inaudible] — get us on track to a balanced budget.
And number five, I will champion small business. I'll make our tax policy — [cheers and applause] — I'll make sure our tax policies and our regulatory policies and health care — all these things come together to make it easier for small business to grow and thrive. We have to do that to get jobs going again because small business is where two-thirds of jobs are created.
These five things will create 12 million jobs and bring rising take-home pay again. America needs this new direction. We cannot go on the path we've been on. We must restore America's strength. And I will do it with your help. [cheers and applause]
And I — and I want you to know I'm confident this is going to happen. We're going to have good years ahead. The — the best is not in the past. The best is in the future. It's getting better. Let me — [cheers] — I've seen throughout my life. I've had the chance to witness the — the great qualities of the human spirit that I've seen in my fellow Americans.
In — in early times and my life and later — I was a relatively young man and serving as the pastor of my congregation, a part-time job of my church. And I happened to visit a family on a regular basis, the Oparowski family. And they — he's a firefighter from Medford, Massachusetts, or was. He's retired now. And their son, age 14, developed leukemia and was very, very ill. It was clear that he was not going to make it. I used to visit David, became close to him.
And on one occasion, he — he brought me into his room. He was on his bed there. And he said to me, he said, what comes next? And I spoke to him about what I believe comes next.
Another occasion, he was in the hospital. And he got in touch with me, and he said, you got a law degree, right? Yes, I do. He said, I'd like to write my will. Could you come do my will for me? And I said, sure. So I got my long pad, my legal pad, went over to his hospital room and then — and he proceeded to describe where he wanted his fishing rod to go and where he wanted his stakeboard to go. And he wanted to give his rifle to his brother.
Throughout all of this, David had courage and strength of character. I'm reminded of that slogan: full eyes — clear eyes, rather, clear eyes, full heart, can't lose. David didn't make it, but he did not lose. David's one of my heroes, one of the confidence builders that I have in America's future.
I — I had the chance at the Republican Convention in Tampa just a few weeks ago to meet a — a wonderful person, Jane Horton . Jane — Jane's the wife of a sharpshooter who was sent to Afghanistan. On the day she was packing a box for his birthday, there was a knock at the door informing her that he had been killed in Afghanistan. And this was at a time when that misguided group was going to the funerals of our servicemen and -women and protesting. (Muted boos.) And she was asked what she thought about that as they were protesting her husband's funeral. And she said this: Chris died so people like him can protest.
This is the greatness of the human heart as demonstrated time and again among the American people. I know that America is going to come back because I've seen the heart of the American people.
We face real challenges right now, but they're not greater than we're able to overcome, as long as we have leaders that will take us on the path (that will ?) restore America's strength and vitality.
[cheers and applause] I'll bring us back — I will get us back on track. I will keep America strong, with strong values and strong homes. I'll make sure we rebuild our economy, we put people to work, and I'll make sure we have the strongest military in the history of the world. [cheers and applause] We'll keep the military second to none. [cheers and applause]
And I have a friend who just joined us, and he doesn't have a raincoat. This is Congressman Scott Rigell. Come on in, Scott. Come in here and say hi to everybody. [cheers and applause] You guys, we're going to win this. Let him say a word or two. I want to shake the hands of the people up front here, but I'm going to let the congressman here — Scott, come say hello to us, will you? [inaudible] — he was supposed to be here first to get us started, but he didn't know we were going to start early. [chuckles]
REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT RIGELL (R-VA): That's right. I think there was a motorcade that might have taken precedent (sic) here. [laughter]
Look, Governor, welcome to Virginia's 2nd Congressional District. This is Navy weather right here. [cheers and applause]
What an honor it is to be here with you today. You're such an encouragement to me and, I know, to the governor. You know, Governor, the finest ships in the world — [inaudible] — are produced right here at Newport News Shipbuilding. [cheers and applause]
Look, from one American to another, thank you so much. And to all of our veterans who are here today, thank you for your service to our country. We have the highest concentration of men and women serving, both active-duty and retired, in any congressional district in America. [cheers and applause] This is a special district.
Governor, we stand with you. We are proud of what you're doing and the leadership that you're going to provide to this great country for every veteran, for every student, every walk of life. We've got a great product. That is, we have the best ideas and the best values. And I'm proud to stand here in the rain with you. It doesn't matter. Our country's worth fighting for.
Thank you so much. The next president of the United States, Governor Romney! [cheers and applause]
Thank you, sir.
MR. ROMNEY: You guys, you're the best. We are going to win this. We're taking back the White House. [cheers and applause] Virginia's going to help us do it. I need your help. Get out there and vote.
Thank you so much. Your courage encourages me. I can't wait to have your help. Thank you so very much. [cheers and applause] We love you. Thank you!

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Van Meter, Iowa

October 9, 2012

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, thank you. [cheers and applause] You guys are great to be out here on a day like this with this wind. Oh, my goodness. Thank you for joining me today. It is exciting. Thank you, Iowa. What a welcome. [cheers and applause] And thank you to Congressman Latham and Congressman King and also to Senator Grassley. What great leaders you have here in this state. What great men. [cheers and applause]
And I know there is a — there is a lot of attention being paid to the campaign these days, and there is — there is a good reason for that. I mean, when you have so many people having tough times — incomes are down, as you know, by about $4,300 a family across America. About 23 million Americans, still looking for a — a good job. You've got college graduates this year, came out last spring, who are still looking for work.
About half the college graduates that came out couldn't find a job or a college-level job. Food stamps — when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps. Now there are 47 million people on food stamps. I mean, these are — [booing] — these are tough times with real serious issues. So you have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)
I actually think we need to have a president who talks about saving the American people and saving good jobs and saving our future — [cheers and applause] — and also — and also saving the family farm. I — I — I come to this place recognizing that — gee, not every John Deere harvester has an R on it like that, but I appreciate — [laughter] — I appreciate that. I — I come today to talk a bit about — about what's happening in the — in the agriculture community and what things we can do to — to do a better job, because this is another place where the president and I have very different points of view about what we do to — to make a difference for — for farming and for the rural communities and — and for Iowa overall, for our whole nation.
One relates to taxation, by the way. The president has this idea that he wants to raise the tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. And that won't be good for farms. My own view is I want to take that tax rate down. I want to take it from 35 percent to 28 percent and help American farmers and small business. [cheers and applause] And you know — you know he has a plan for the death tax. He's planning on raising the death tax pretty significantly. My own view is we ought to kill the death tax. You paid for that farm once. You shouldn't have to pay for it again. [cheers and applause]
Now, now and then a farmer is successful enough to save a little money. And when you do save your money, the president has this idea of raising your taxes a lot on your savings, your interest and dividends and capital gains, if you're lucky enough to have them.
My view is that if you're making $200,000 a year and less, you should pay no tax whatsoever on interest, dividends or capital gains. [cheers and applause]
Now, the president and I have different records when it comes — and viewpoints when it comes to exports. You recognize that about a million jobs in this country are associated with agricultural exports, and over the last four years the president has signed no new trade agreements with any nation around the world. Even as China and European nations have put together some 44 different agreements, he's done none. What I'm going to do is make sure that I devote my time to getting trade promotion authority, that I use that authority to negotiate new deals, that we open new markets for American farms and for American goods of all kinds, because we can compete on a level playing field with anyone in the world. [cheers and applause]
Now, there are differences on regulations, by the way, and you know this. The regulatory burden under this administration has just gone — has just gone crazy. The president's regulations as it relates to farming are kind of interesting. One is the EPA tried to get into — well — [inaudible] — EPA — the government tried to get into regulating rainwater in ditches on farms, all right? It used to be that there was rainwater in Iowa, and people cared about that. [laughter] We hope it's coming back soon. [laughter]
But in addition, they of course want to regulate dust. They want to impose duplicate roles — rules, rather, on — on pesticides. There was an actually an effort — you recall this — to prevent teenagers from being able to work in certain types of functions on farms. And then — and then there's pushing cap and trade. I understand if they push cap and trade, it will not only massively impact the income of farms, it'll take millions of acres out of farming.
My own view on regulation is very different. You have to have regulation; you need regulation for markets to work effectively. But I am going to cut back on regulation. I'm going to put a cap on regulation, and any new major regulation will have to be approved by Congress. I'm not letting the politicians off the hook. [cheers and applause]
Now, energy has a big — big impact on the farm as well. About 20 percent of the cost on a farm is associated with energy — not just fuel but also fertilizer, which is, of course, energy-based. And of course, you know his record. If you watched that debate, you know that he has cut the — the number of permits and licenses on federal land for drilling for oil and gas — and in federal waters — by about half. My view is I will double those permits. [cheers and applause] I'll make sure we get the energy that we need. And I'll build that pipeline from Canada as well. [cheers and applause]
And let me — let me just also note that, you know, people have been waiting a long time for a farm bill. And the president has to exert the kind of presidential leadership it takes to get the House and the Senate together and actually pass a farm bill. That's something I will devote my time to, to make sure that we get that bill passed so farmers know what they can expect.
There are big differences between the president and me. He has no plan for rural America, no plan for agriculture, no plan for getting people back to work. And I do. You know I've spoken about it all over the country. And I'm going to make sure I help the American farmer and I help our economy and I get America working again. [cheers and applause] And — and I'm confident it's going to work. I'm confident that despite our challenges, America's going to come roaring back.
I've had the occasion over my life to see some of the great qualities of the human spirit. I've seen them manifest in — in young people and older people and Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities and ages. I — I was serving as a pastor in my church, something we do part-time in my church.
And I — I had the occasion to make friends with a family from a town a couple of doors away, the Oparowski family. He's firefighter in Medford, Massachusetts, his wife a homemaker. They have a couple of boys.
They informed me after a number of visits I made to their home that — that their 14-year-old son had been diagnosed with leukemia. And as time went on, it became very clear that there was not going to be a cure. And — and so I met with David, became his friend. He — on one occasion, I said, what — if you could have anything you wanted, what would you like to have? He said, fireworks. So I went up to New Hampshire, where they're legal, and got a big box of fireworks. [laughter]
And — and then I sat down with him one day in his — in his bedroom. He was laying on the bed there, and — and he said, what comes next? What comes next? And — and I explained to him what I believe about what comes next after this life. And then later, as he was in the hospital, he — he contacted me and said, now, you went to law school. Yes, I did. I don't practice the law; I'm not licensed to practice in Massachusetts. I hope this won't get me in trouble. But he said, Mitt, would you — would you come to the hospital and write my will for me? And so I said, of course. And I got one of those big legal pads and went to his hospital room, and he laid out what he wanted to do. He said, my fishing pole goes to this guy, and my skateboard goes to that guy, and my rifle is going to my brother.
And through all of this, what astonished me was to watch a man of his young age with such calm and — and serious and sober sentiment. He wasn't despondent. He wasn't depressed. He — he was looking forward to the life hereafter. And I thought, as I saw some years later a — a phrase that seemed to capture my memory of David Oparowski: "Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose."
This is something that we share in this country, men and women of clear eyes and full hearts, and America can't lose. [cheers and applause]
I learned — I learned recently about another fellow that I met that I might mention to you. I — this is kind of a strange story, so bear with me, here. I — I got — I got one of these mailers that was put in my — in my mailbox at — at Christmas time a couple of years ago saying there was going to be a Christmas party for the neighborhood and everyone was invited.
And I didn't look very carefully at the address, but — but later that night, when the Christmas party was supposed to happen, I noticed that the — that the house just kitty-corner for us had all the lights on, and people were on the porch. They were kind of looking at — over at our house, and I thought, oh my goodness, I wasn't planning on going to this, but we'll look like we're not social if we don't show up. So I — [laughter] — I said to Ann, we've got to go to this party. I got this flier about the neighborhood party. We got to go over there. So she said OK.
We — we went over and knocked on the door. They let us in, good to see you. We came in. They had dinner — we had dinner together and got our pictures with everybody. Turns out this wasn't the neighborhood party. [laughter] This was a — this was a family having a party with their friends, all right? [laughter] And so we were a little embarrassed, but — [laughter] — they treated us well nonetheless, and — [laughter] — and I got to meet some really interesting people. [laughter]
One — one of them was a guy, actually, from my home state of Massachusetts and a relatively young guy compared to me. And he was a former Navy SEAL. He was living in San Diego. And learned about him. He talked about his life. He also — he skied a lot. He skied in some of the places I had, and we had a lot of things in common. He told me that he kept — keeps going back to the Middle East. He cares very deeply about the people there. He served in the military there, went back from time to time to offer security services and so forth to people there.
You could imagine how I felt when I found out that he was one of the two former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi on September 11th.
And it — it touched me, obviously, as I recognized this young man that I thought was so impressive had lost his life in the service of his fellow men and women. He — according to the reports on CNN International that I read, he was actually in a different building, in an annex, a safe place somewhere else across town, when he and his colleagues there heard that the consulate was under attack. And they went there. They didn't hunker down where they were in safety. They rushed there to go help. This is the American way. We go where there's trouble. We go where we're needed. [cheers and applause] And right now we're needed. Right now the American people need us.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: They do, Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: It's a critical time for us. And I commit this to you. If I — when I become president — [cheers and applause] — when I become president, I will do everything in my power to strengthen once again the American farm, to strengthen the family farm. I'll do everything in my power to strengthen our economy, to create good jobs and rising incomes again. I'll strengthen the values in our homes and communities. I'll strengthen our economy. And I'll make sure our military is second to none in the world. I will not cut our military commitment. [cheers and applause]
And I know people ask you to do a lot of things. We come here in politics. You're — you get so used to politicians, I don't know how you deal with us. But I — [laughter] — everything from the straw poll and the caucuses and the primaries and now the general election. But I want to ask you for a commitment, and that is for you to — to find at least one person who voted for Barack Obama last time and convince them to come join more time. It'd be fine, more than one. I need your help to do that — [cheers and applause] — because our kids need it, the 23 million people out of work need it, need our help, and by the way, the world needs us.
This is a critical time around the world. We stand on the shoulders, in some respects, of the greatest generation. I was at a celebration on Memorial Day in San Diego, and — and a number of veterans there. We had four from the second world war on the stand, one of them a — a veteran who was on the USS Tennessee, and he was the lookout on the USS Tennessee on the day of Pearl Harbor. He said his eyes locked on the eyes of the pilot that brought in the armament that hit their ship and other ships. He went on, however, even though he was injured, to serve for 33 years in the United States Navy.
And I think about those men and women who have served us in the greatest generation. There are not as many as there used to be because of their age, and — and those that there are can't hold the torch quite as high as they used to. It's a torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. America has held that torch aloft for a long, long time.
Now it's our turn. We've got to grab that torch — [applause] — we're going to do it together. We're going to take back this country. We're going to keep it strong. We're going to get America going again. [cheers and applause]
You guys, Iowa is going to help elect me the next president of the United States, and I will make sure that I hold you in highest esteem and keep America proud of everything we are. Thank you so very much. [cheers and applause] Thanks, you guys. Great to be with you today. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks with Senator Rob Portman and Governor Chris Christie at a Campaign Event in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio

October 9, 2012

PORTMAN: What a crowd! Summit County looked like Romney/Ryan country to me! [applause] Thank you for being here. Thank you for caring enough about your country not just to be here but for all you're going to do over the next 28 days to elect Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. [applause] All right, raise your hand if you've made a phone call for Mitt. [applause] Raise your hand — raise your hand if you've gone door to door for Mitt. [applause] Raise your hand if you've put up a yard sign for Mitt. [applause] We want every hand raised!
Folks this election is too important for us to not leave it all on the field. You agree with me? [applause] Early voting, be sure you go to everyone you know and help them with that application for an absentee ballot. Have you early voted yet? Raise your hand. Get everybody early voting. We cannot afford another four years of Barack Obama. [applause]
Folks, four years ago Barack Obama said if you don't have a record to run on, then you attack your opponent and you make a big election about small things. Barack Obama's latest TV ad features Big Bird. Talk about making a big election about small things. Folks, we're not going to let him do that, are we?
AUDIENCE: No!
SEN. PORTMAN: We're going to make this election about big things, not distortions, not negative ads. It's going to be about the proposals that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have to put people back to work in Northeast Ohio and get at the deficit and debt in this country. [applause] It's going to be about his pro-growth proposals to restore the American dream. We have somebody here on stage with us tonight who's done that in his home state of New Jersey. [applause] He likes to tell it like it is. [applause]
As a prosecutor, he took on the gangs, he took on the politicians. As a governor, he's taken on the special interests to do what's right for the people of New Jersey. Folks, there is no more effective advocate out there for Mitt Romney. Please help me welcome the governor of New Jersey — [applause] — go for it.
CHRISTIE: All right, Ohio. You ready to get the job done?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
GOV. CHRISTIE: Now, listen, I tell you, a few weeks ago, I watched the Democratic National Convention. I did it as a sacrifice in service to my country. I sat on my couch in my living room. I made my 12-year-old son Patrick bring me a big bottle of water because I've got to tell you when I hear that much BS, I get lightheaded. I get lightheaded.
So I had to stay alert. I had to stay hydrated. I had to stay with it. And I had to listen. And I listened and I heard a lot of crazy stuff. But let me tell you the thing that worried me the most. Something that they said at the Democratic National Convention, that they own. This is what they said. They said government is the only thing we all belong to.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
GOV. CHRISTIE: Now, I want you — I know. But I want you to listen to that again. Government is the only thing we all belong to. Now, I have to tell you something, everybody. I'm from New Jersey and we've got more than our share of Democrats in my state. But even in my state they taught this simple truth. We don't belong to government. The government belongs to us. [applause]
See, the Declaration of Independence starts off: we the people. We the people give limited authority and power to the government to act for us, not make them pick the winners and losers in America. [applause] See, the problem with this president is he sees all of us as just actors and pawns in his great plan to — (audio break) — in unnamed buildings in Washington, D.C., should decide who wins and who loses in Ohio.
Let me tell you one thing. Mitt Romney thinks you should decide who wins and loses in America. [applause] In the America that Mitt Romney is going to help lead us back to, it's going to be the three big factors that are going to decide who wins and loses in America — your ingenuity, your integrity and your work ethic. Those are the three things that always determined it in America. Let's put the people back in charge of our country, not the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. [applause]
And you know, the senator said I'm a former prosecutor. So I want to end by making a little closing statement. And the best way to make a closing statement — we won lots of cases — was not to use your own words but to use the words of the person that you're prosecuting. And so, tonight we'll use the words of the president of the United States. And the president of the United States said that you can't change Washington from the inside. That's what he said. He said it himself.
And I feel badly for the president. Maybe he's still a little tired from last Wednesday night. Maybe he's a little — [applause]. Maybe he's just a little disoriented when he said it. But let me remind him because I want to help the president I'm sure, because he loves me. I'm sure he's out there listening. Mr. President, you have lived inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for four years. If you can't change Washington from inside the White House then let's get you the plane ticket back the plane ticket to Chicago you've earned. [applause]
And there is one man who's going to make sure that that ticket gets punched on November 6th. There is one man who has got the integrity, the ingenuity, the work ethic and the wherewithal to be able to make that happen for us. Ladies and gentlemen, we all have to spend the next 28 days taking our country back and the man who's going to lead us on that fight is the next president of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney. [applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you! Thank you, Governor! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you! Wow! Thank you, Ohio. What a welcome! Thank you! Well, thank you, Governor Christie. Thank you, Senator Portman. Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Taylor, Congressman Renacci, each of you who've come and spoken this evening. I owe them a great deal for being here. I owe you probably even more for standing out in the cold all this time to wait for us. Thank you for your help.
We're going to make it make a difference. [applause] I've been watching some of the — of President Obama's rallies and they chant four more years, four more years. And today there are 28 days before the election. I think the right chant ought to be for them four more weeks, four more weeks, all right? [applause] And with an audience like this —
AUDIENCE: Four more weeks! Four more weeks! Four more weeks!
MR. ROMNEY: You got the idea. You got the idea. I know there' greater and greater interest in this campaign across the country.
The fact that, I don't know, 10,000 people or more are here this evening is a testament to how much people care about this election. I know people are focusing on how the country is going to be led going forward and I think that's in part because people are facing some tough times. There are a lot of people out of work, of course. Twenty-three million people struggling for a good job. One out of six people has fallen into poverty. You probably know this. The number of people on food stamps has gone from 32 million when the president was elected to 47 million today. That's a that's a 15 million —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He built that!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, he built that, yeah. That's a 15 million-person increase. That's even bigger than the state of Ohio, number of new people on food stamps. And so people are concerned. People graduating from college can't find work. Half the kids coming out of college can't find work or college level work.
And so people are focused on big things as these speakers just mentioned, very big things. At a time like this for the president to get up and say as he has over these last several days that he's focused on saving Big Bird is kind of a strange thing in my view because, you see, I'm focused on helping the American people get good jobs and brighter prospects. [applause]
Now, I must admit I enjoyed the debate we had last week. That was a great experience. [applause] And I was able to ask the president some of the questions that people across the country have wanted to ask him like why it was with 23 million people out of work he spent his first two years pushing "Obamacare" that made it harder for people to get jobs and why it was with trillion-dollar deficits he took $90 billion to put into green energy companies.
And why it was that when he promised us that health insurance costs were going to come down for the average family by $2,500 a year instead they went up by $2,500 a year. And so I asked him these questions and he gave his answers or non-answers as the case may be. I actually think that people have heard what he had to say and it's time for them to see him leave the White House and to say goodbye to him on November 6th. [applause] Now, we —
AUDIENCE: Four more weeks! Four more weeks! Four more weeks!
MR. ROMNEY: You know, one thing we did agree upon in that debate was that we represent two very different pathways for America. And I hope you've given some thought to that. See, the president spoke about his plans going forward. It's very clear what'll happen. If he were to be reelected president, why, he would spend a trillion dollars more every year than we take in. In my view, we have a moral responsibility to stop taking — let me say it again. In my view, we have a moral responsibility to stop spending more money than we take in and passing on those debts to our kids. [applause]
Borrowing billions of dollars from China and passing on those burdens is wrong. It's bad for the economy. It's bad for the future. It'll kill the American dream. And if I'm president, I will get us on track to finally having a balanced budget. [applause] This is not just a matter of economics. This is not just a matter of how much we're going to pay in interest costs down the road. It's a matter of whether American is going to continue to lead the world, whether we're going to have the capacity to provide a bright future for our kids. It's a matter of whether we're going to be able to have a military that's second to none in the world. I will get America strong by strengthening our foundation and that means getting us on track to a balanced budget. Now, there's another difference between us. This is a president who, if he's reelected, will put in place or install "Obamacare." That will cost —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: That will cost an additional $2,500 per family on top of what we're already spending. We can't afford that. I will repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with real reforms. [applause] If this president were to be reelected, why, you're going to see him cut the military, hundreds of billions of dollars of cuts in his own budget.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: And that sequestration idea of his, that takes out hundreds of billions of dollars more. I will not cut our military. We will keep our military second to none. [applause] And then of course there's his jobs plan, or the — exactly right. What jobs plan was a question from up front here. He basically laid out in that debate what his jobs plan was and it sounded eerily reminiscent of what it was four years ago and that did not work. I hope you understand that. He is speaking about the status quo. He wants another stimulus. How'd the last one work out?
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: He wants to pick winners and losers like Solyndra and Tesla and Fisker — or losers, in his case. He also wants to hire more government workers. There's nothing wrong with government workers. But that's not going to get our economy going. He wants to raise taxes on small business. I will not raise taxes on small business. [applause]
And you see, by virtue of what he's describing, you're going to see unemployment if he were reelected to stay high. You're going to see wage growth nonexistent. And of course, you'll see fiscal crises like they're seeing in Europe. I want to take a very different path. I have five things I'll do to get this economy going. Number one, we're going to take advantage of our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear, our renewables. [applause]
We have abundant natural resources and taking advantage of them will put people to work in the energy sector. It will also bring back manufacturing. Taking advantage of our energy resources will create 3-1/2 to 4 million jobs. We need them. I want them. We're going to get them in this country. [applause]
Now number two, we're going to take advantage of trade. We're going to open up new markets for trade. President Obama's been in office four years. He's signed no new trade agreements. I will open up trade, particularly in Latin America, to help get more good jobs in this country. And by the way, I'm going to crack down on China when they cheat. They can't steal our jobs with unfair practices. [applause] Number three, we're going to make training programs work for our people to make sure they have the jobs of today, have the skills for those jobs. We're going to get our schools to finally be world-class as they once were. Look, we're the nation that invented public education. It's an embarrassment. It's also unfair to our kids to have our schools performing in the bottom third of the world. I will make sure it's time to put our kids and our parents and the teachers first and the teachers union behind. [applause]
Number four — number four, I've already mentioned. But you're not going to get entrepreneurs to start a little business and to risk their life savings or big businesses to come to Ohio and build a new facility and hire people if they think we're on the road to Greece and that's why one more reason is there that we simply cannot keep on spending more money than we take in. We must stop it. I'll put us on track to a balanced budget with a balanced budget amendment capping federal spending and cutting spending.
And number five — and number five, we're going to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. I'm going to help small businesses with lower taxes, regulations that work to help small business and of course we're going to help small business by repealing "Obamacare." It kills jobs. [applause]
Those five — those five steps are going to bring jobs back. We're going to create 12 million jobs with those five steps. We're going to get rising incomes again. Look, you can compare two very different paths. The president is describing what he's done for the last four years. He calls it forward. I call it forewarned, all right. We know where that leads. We don't have to ask where a stimulus and more government hiring and government investments by him and various companies and raising taxes will lead. We know where that leads. We're experiencing it now. We cannot afford four more years like the last four years. [applause]
AUDIENCE: Four more weeks! Four more weeks! Four more weeks!
MR. ROMNEY: Now, I want you to know — I want you to know how confident I am in America's future and it comes because of the heart and spirit of the American people. We're a patriotic people. We're a people that are imbued with the great qualities of the human spirit. I've seen that throughout my life. I had the occasion to serve as pastor in my church for a while. In my church, you do that part-time. I did that as a lay minister and I got to know the Oparowski family well. You may have seen them at the Republican convention.
He's a firefighter from Medford, Massachusetts, and she's a homemaker. They have two sons. I got to know them and visit them about once a month for a number of years. And then we learned that their youngest son David had contracted leukemia. The doctors did their work but concluded that there was no prospect of his recovery. And so David brought me into his room on one occasion. He was lying in bed and he said to me, what comes next. I described my beliefs to him. He looked at me with a seriousness and sobriety and thoughtfulness.
Then later as he became more ill and was in the hospital he asked me to come by the hospital. He heard and knew that I had a law degree even though I wasn't a practicing lawyer and he said he hoped that I could draft a will for him. So I went to the hospital — (audio break) — skateboard and of course he gave his rifle to his brother. This is a young man of seriousness and thoughtfulness and character. I've seen that character throughout the experiences I've had with the American people.
He exemplified a saying that I've heard since which is clear eyes, full heart, can't lose. David Oparowski is a young man who didn't lose. He lost his life but kept his character, the character of a true American and I sure love that young man. [applause]
I had a different experience that also reminds me of the character of the American people and gives me confidence in the great qualities that we have. I was in my neighborhood and I got a flyer around Christmastime announcing that there was going to be a neighborhood party with the address. And that evening when the day for the party came along, I wasn't planning on going. But it turned out that I looked behind our house and there were some people having a big party and looking out over our house from their deck there.
And I said to Ann, you know, if we don't go over there we're going to look unsocial because we're right here. They can see our lights on. So she agreed and she got dressed up and we went over there and went inside and they welcomed us. They were very friendly and they had dinner and everything. We had dinner with them and got pictures taken. It was really wonderful except it turned out this wasn't the neighborhood party. [laughter]
This was some guy and his wife having a party with their friends and I showed up and it's, like, well, come on in, you know. So we came in and I met some remarkable people. One of whom — one of whom was a former Navy SEAL and he'd served with our SEALs. [applause] And you know, even after he left the SEALs, he wanted to continue to make a difference in the Middle East. He cared about the people there and so he volunteered for assignments to go over and provide security for various efforts in the Middle East to try and help there — (audio break) — Benghazi.
And it broke my heart. He was a guy who had lived in my home state of Massachusetts. We shared some passions for the kinds of things he was interested in. And I read a story about him and about the fellow that he was with, the other former Navy SEAL. They were apparently not in the consulate when it was hit. They were apparently in another facility across town according to CNN International.
And when they heard that the consulate was under attack they didn't go hide. They didn't hunker down. They got up with some others and came to the consulate to the aid of their fellows. [applause] That's America. That's America. That's the American spirit. We face some real challenges but we don't run from them. We run to them. We confront them. Right now, we face some major challenges in this country. This debt is a threat to us. It's got to end.
This economy is not creating the jobs it should. We've got to fix it. Our schools aren't preparing our kids for the jobs of tomorrow. We've got to fix them so we can give our kids the bright prospects they deserve. Our military — we depend upon it for our security. We depend upon it to help provide liberty to others around the world. The idea of cutting it by a trillion dollars is unthinkable. We must strengthen it and keep it the hope of the Earth that it's been for decades and decades. [applause]
This is — this is our time. This is our time here. We benefit from the fact that the greatest generation provided for us prosperity and peace and gave us hope and optimism for the future. They held a torch aloft for us to see. But there are not as many of them as there used to be. And they're not able to hold the torch as high as they used to because of their age. It's our time to take that torch. It's America's honor to carry that torch of freedom and hope and opportunity for the world. And we're going to do it. [applause]
We're going to do it here in Ohio. And I make this commitment to you. My commitment to you is that I will do everything in my power to keep America strong. I will restore the values that made America the nation that it is. I will do everything I can to strengthen our economy to get more good jobs for our people and rising incomes again. I'll do everything I can to strengthen our military, to stand with our friends globally to make sure we don't show distance between ourselves and our best friends in the world.
I will do everything to get this country right again. That's my commitment to you — (audio break) — Obama and get them to come join our team. [applause] This is not about one person. It's not about a political party. It's about our country. The soul of America is at stake. This is a time we have to come together and take back America. We're going to do it. Ohio's going to elect me the next president of the United States. And we'll do it together. Thank you so very much! Great to be with you! Thank you!

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Mount Vernon, Ohio

October 10, 2012

[cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible] — Chris. Thank you. Ah, thank you so much. Thank you. Very generous. Thank you. [applause] Thank you. Thank you so much. Jim. Thank you.
Thank you, Chris, for those words and that generous introduction. Good to have Governor Christie here. I'm sorry to take him away from New — New Jersey for the day, but he's on the bus with me and your great senator, Rob Portman. Thank you, Senator Portman, also for being here with us and getting us started today. [applause]
Thank you, Congressman Gibbs, for getting us started as well. You're going to get re-elected. We need to have you in Washington. I'll look forward to that, Congressman. [applause]
And special thanks also to Karen and Jim, Jim, who got this going, who figured out how to design a pump that the world now considers the world standard. Thank you, Jim, for your — your great work. [cheers and applause]
Stand up, so people know who you are. Stand up — [inaudible] — standing up. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
For those that are — [applause] — now I'm hardly an expert on — on compressors, but for those who don't know what Jim did, he — he designed — he didn't just manufacture these pumps from someone else's drawings; he designed the — the technology, made the technology work that creates the pumps that are still being used today and that are that world standard and — and built this enterprise. And in fact, Jim, you and your family and these people who are sitting around us, you did build it. This was not built by government. Thank you, Jim. [cheers and applause]
Now Karen's around here somewhere., Where'd Karen go? There she is, right in the center.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh.
MR. ROMNEY: Karen is running the operation now, learned from her mom and dad and — and is running this business masterfully well. Congratulations. I — I appreciate your comments and your words.
And Chris Christie stealing your line like that — that's simply not fair. [laughter] But I'm — I'm glad he blurted it out. That was very helpful.
And let me also tell you how appreciative I am of — of something we share. Karen and my — my wife are both breast cancer survivors. And — [applause] — thank you. [inaudible] Thank you, Karen . [applause]
And Karen was — Karen was kind to remind me that this is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and gave me this pin, which I'm wearing this morning, in her honor and the honor of my wife and honor of all the women across America who have battled this terrible disease and know of our commitment to defeat it and to provide long lives to — to our fellow citizens.
This is a important time for America, and I appreciate your willingness to stop production for a few hours, hopefully not too long here, and — and to let me have a chance to speak to you. I — I'm going to turn to you for questions in just a few moments and let you ask any questions you'd like, and — and I'll answer some, and if they're real tough, I'll have Chris answer them. [laughter] And — and so you can think up those questions.
A few words before we — we get going. We — we had a debate last week about — actually about a week ago, and — and that was a good experience. [applause] I — I enjoyed that. [cheers and applause] We — we spoke about important things, and I think the — the president and I were each able to describe a vision of where we take the country, and our views were — were quite different.
The president would install "Obamacare," and it's been shown that the cost of "Obamacare" per family is about $2,500 more. I — I would instead repeal "Obamacare" and replace "Obamacare" with real reforms — [applause] — that bring down the cost of health care — [cheers and applause] — and save (more ?) money. (Sustained cheers, applause.)
The president indicated that you're going to see higher taxes under his administration. You already have under "Obamacare," but — but that will continue. Actually, the vice president blurted out the truth by saying that he's going to add about a trillion dollars in taxes, and taxes, by the way, do not create jobs. Raising taxes on people make it harder for enterprises to grow and hire people.
I will not raise taxes on small business. I'll not raise taxes on business. I'll not raise taxes on middle-income people. I won't raise taxes at all on the American people. [applause] It's a very different approach. [cheers and applause]
When the president was running as a candidate four years ago, he looked at the deficits under President Bush and found them to be excessive and un-American, and they're about half as large as the ones he's put in place over each of the last four years. He said he was going to cut the deficit in half; he's doubled it. There's no question but that if he were to be re-elected, we'd see trillion-dollar deficits again and again and again. Our national debt now is almost the same as our total economy, our GDP. This slows down the economy. It makes it harder for businesses to grow and hire more people and to raise wages. And so unlike the president, when I finally get this job, I will cap federal spending, I will cut federal spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
There are — there are other differences, as well. The president is planning on, through "Obamacare," cutting Medicare for our current retirees for $716 billion. I think that's wrong. I think we must honor the promise made to our seniors. I will restore that funding and make sure we protect Medicare and Social Security.
And one more thing I'll mention. The president's budget calls for shrinking our military by hundreds of billions of dollars, and then this sequestration idea the White House came up with cuts it another few hundred billion. The secretary of defense has called those kinds of cuts devastating to our national security. I will not cut our military. I'll restore that funding and keep our military second-to-none in the world. [cheers and applause]
Now, there's one more place where you saw a distinction between the two of us. We were asked about how we'd get the economy going and create jobs.
And I hope you listened carefully to the president's response, because what he said was reminiscent of what he said four years ago, with stimulus and hiring more government workers and raising taxes. Those things don't create jobs. Those don't help the private sector employ more people and expand. Those don't encourage entrepreneurs to start new businesses. His plans do not create jobs for the American people or rising incomes.
I actually have a plan that will create 12 million new jobs and get rising incomes again. By the way, the median income of an American family over the last four years has gone down $4,300 a family, and that's even as gasoline, as you know, has doubled in price, food costs are up, health care fees are up $2,500 a person. These have been tough times for middle-income families. And so my plan, one, creates more jobs, and two, gets rising take-home pay again.
And how do I do it? I've got five things I'll do to get this economy going. Number one: We're going to take full advantage of our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear and our renewables. [cheers and applause] What — what you've seen over the last four years, as you know, is additional exploration and — and production coming from private lands, coming from private lands. On government land — on government land and government waters, the production is nada. As a matter of fact, oil production on government land is down I think it's 11 percent last year, and gas production down to I think it's 16 percent, but both are down.
That's the wrong direction. If I'm president, I will double the number of permits and licenses on federal lands and in federal waters, and we're going to get the federal land and federal waters to produce more energy — [applause] — just like the private sector is doing now on private land.
[applause]
Number two, we're going to have more trade. We're going to open up trade, particularly in Latin America. We're going to crack down on cheaters. China has cheated in trade over the years. We can't have unfair trade practices. So number two, we're going to make trade work for us.
Number three, we're going to have great training programs so people who lose employment opportunities will find new ones (in ?) real jobs. And we're going to fix our schools by making sure we put our kids and their parents and the teachers first. We'll put the interests of the teachers' union behind. We want to make our kids first when it comes to education. [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four, I mentioned getting to a balanced budget. That's critical because, you see, entrepreneurs and businesses that are thinking of expanding aren't going to take their life savings or the savings of others to invest in America if they think we're headed to Greece, if they think we're headed on a path where our country will be in severe economic crisis, as Greece is. And if we keep spending like we're spending, massively more than we take in, that's where we're headed. I think this excessive spending is not just bad economics and not just bad for jobs. I think it's not moral for us to spend more money than we take in and pass it on to our kids; and I'll stop it. [applause]
And finally — finally, I want to champion small business. I want to help entrepreneurs and innovators open their doors. Two-thirds of new jobs over the last 50 years were created by small business. So I want to help small business do that, by keeping their taxes down, by getting regulators to get out of the way, as Karen said, by making sure that "Obamacare" doesn't scare away small business. I want to make sure that we help small businesses thrive and grow.
Look, this is the place in a — in a factory like this and in factory floors across America and in shops of all kinds, this is where jobs are created. This is where the American people get their incomes. I want to make it easier for people to be hired. I want to make these enterprises more prosperous, so they can afford to pay more money to the people who work here.
My whole passion is about helping the American people who are struggling right now. That's what this is about.
The president says he's for the middle class. How have they done under his presidency? Not so well. I want to help the middle class get good jobs and better take-home pay. I know how to do that. I spent my life working — working in enterprises. I understand how jobs come and why they go. I want to bring them back. I want to that skill and that knowledge to get America working again.
And I'll tell you this. I need your vote. I need your help, because if you vote for me, and if you get some other people to do the same thing, Ohio's going to elect me the next president of the United States. [cheers and applause] Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you. Now let's turn to you. Let's turn to you. We'll take a question here and a — (oh, this is not terribly shy — yeah ?), we'll see here. We'll give you a couple more minutes.
Yes, sir. There's a question back there. Yes.
Q: (Off mic.)
MR. ROMNEY: I'm glad we didn't have a microphone for the first part of your question. [laughter]
Go ahead. Here comes the microphone. You can set it on the aisle here. Yes.
Q: Last Wednesday I was laying in bed with my wife — [laughter] —
MR. ROMNEY: You repeated it anyway.
Q: I was a good boy. And I was so excited and so nervous for the debate, praying for you, and I was so happy with the outcome of that Wednesday that it really brought joy to my heart, and you finally got your word out without the media distorting it, and you did a great job, and I just want to commend you, and I hope tomorrow we have another great job with Governor — not Governor Ryan, but Congressman Ryan. So keep up the fight, and we're all rooting for you. And my question is how do you — how do you handle the mainstream media out there? Do you — do you feel like you get a fair shake?
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, yeah, good question, and thank you for the generous comments. I think what — what I liked most about the debate was that it gave both the president and me a chance to address the American people directly, and they could hear what we believe from us, as opposed to from the — as opposed to coming from the ads of the opposition campaign. And I've — [applause] — this morning my wife was on Good Morning America between the 8:00 and 9:00 time hour, and I got to watch her. But between her segments, I also watched some of the ads, some of the ads on me. And I — it's a good thing I don't do that very often because my blood pressure would be very high — [laughter] — because I saw these things that — I don't believe that. That's not me; I don't believe that.
And yet people here in Ohio are getting bombarded with things that simply aren't true, and so the debates are a good opportunity to break through that.
I — I actually think that the media in our nation is — is free; people are able to say what they want to say. They don't have a responsibility to slant things my way or the other way. They have a right to slant things any way they — they wish, because that's the nature of a free media and a free society. We have some members of the media that are more inclined towards my way of thinking, some others that are more inclined the other way.
The good news, in my opinion, about the — the political environment today is that you can choose those sources you find to be most reliable. And there's — there's radio, talk radio, there are cable TV stations, there are hundreds of stations, and so you can find those that you think are most credible, most reliable.
And I think that's in part why — why, for instance, on "Obamacare," while the so-called mainstream media was by and large supportive of "Obamacare," people were able to hear the other side of the story from other sources of news that might not have been available 25 years ago. And as a result, the American people recognized it for what it is, and they don't want it.
And — and so I'm — you know, I don't worry in my campaign about what the media says. I worry about what I communicate to assure that it's precisely what I feel, that people understand that, and the debates are a good chance to do it. And by the way, I think Paul Ryan'll do great. Thank you. [applause]
Q: Hello, Governor. I'm Jennifer Springer. I'm president of the Knox County Republican Women's Club. I'm also an assistant prosecuting attorney. I'm the proud mother of two young boys. My oldest son has special needs. He has spina bifida. Lately I've been hearing ads on the radio from — about "Obamacare" from Obama that basically I believe they're trying to scare parents like myself into voting for Obama because, you know, if you have a child with special needs, you need "Obamacare."
What do you think about those ads? If you're heard them or been briefed on those, what do you think about that?
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. I haven't heard those — those ads. And congratulations to you for the two kids, and very best to your son that has spina bifida, and — and wish him the very best.
Actually, we had health care in America before "Obamacare" came along, and we still have health care in America. And we still have health care in America. [applause] And — and the idea that, somehow, we're not going to have health care in America if we don't have "Obamacare" is simply wrong and it's fearmongering and — and — and I think that's in part why the American people are so upset with the president.
What — what we don't need is the federal government telling us what kind of health care we should have for ourselves. Each of us today in America has a choice of the type of health care plan we might choose. People who are poor are able to get Medicaid, which is — which is a government support effort for those that can't afford to have insurance.
And — and these things aren't going to disappear without "Obamacare." What's going to happen without "Obamacare" is, we'll be able to get — finally get the premiums to come down a bit in cost and lower the rate of growth in health care expenditures; we'll let people choose the plans they want, as opposed to the plan that the president thinks he and the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., are going to impose on the American people. I — I don't think it's Washington's role to tell the American people how to live our lives or what kind of health care we can have.
And — [applause] — and I can sure tell you this. Everything I will do, when I'm president of the United States, will be designed to help people who have needs like your son, to make sure we care for them, to seek — to seek for the cures for diseases of all kinds. Almost every family I know has been touched by — by some type of disease or tragedy, and they want to know that we're working together to try and help.
And I will do that. I care for — for the American people and want to help families like yours.
At the same time, I know the best way to do that is not always to have the government get between the entrepreneurs and the innovators and the doctors and the people who need help. And I'm not going to put a bureaucrat between you and your doctor. Thank you. [applause]
Go over there. I'll give you this — oh, that's a long question.
Q: It's not every day I talk to the future president, so I figured I better prepare. (Laughter, applause, cheers.)
Section 1021 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act gives the president the explicit power to detain, via the armed forces, any person, including us, U.S. citizens, for an indefinite period of time without trial. Given that the NDAA determines the actual budget for the military, it's kind of politically risky to veto it.
Would you have vetoed it because of that part of the bill that says, hey, we can detain you no matter what, and sent it back to Congress, or would you have signed it?
MR. ROMNEY: I'll look at that particular piece of legislation. I can tell you this, that I believe that much of what happens in Washington is driven by the leadership we have there. And I can assure you that when I become president — you introduced it that way — when I become president, I will not do things that interfere with the rights of our citizens and their freedom.
At the same time, I support efforts like the Patriot Act and others to secure our nation from those who would attack us. We were just attacked, as you know, in Benghazi. Terrorists successfully killed our ambassador and three of — of our citizens.
And — and I will — I will work very hard to ensure that ensure that we use every source of our intelligence and our security personnel to protect the American people, to protect our lives.
As to that specific piece of — of legislation, I'm happy to take a look at it, but I — I — I don't believe that this is a time for us to be pulling back from our vigilance to protecting America and keeping us safe from the kinds of threats we face around the world. [applause]
Q: Governor Romney, that's a very nice title, governor, but I hope we can soon address you as Mr. President. [cheers and applause]
The president never seems to miss the opportunity to apologize for the greatness of this country as he travels around the world. The Mideast is in turmoil right now. As you mentioned, our president — our ambassador was assassinated in Libya. The American flag is being burned in the Middle East. Our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu, seems to wonder whether we've given them the cold shoulder. The clock continues to tick with Iran building a nuclear bomb. How would you handle this international situation when you become president of the United States? [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. I'll begin by quoting something I have for — for the last several weeks, which was a — a conversation I had with Lech Walesa when I was in Poland. And — and he said, where is American leadership? The world needs American leadership.
We have to have a — [cheers and applause] — we have to have a strategy in the Middle East and other parts of the world so that we are helping shape events as opposed to just living at the mercy of events.
So we see things happening in Syria, for instance, 25(000), 30,000 people killed. Are we shaping events there, or are we simply watching what's happening? My own is in a place like Syria, for instance, we should, through our partners in the region, work to identify dissidents within Syria that are reasonable and responsible people, try and coalesce them, bring them together, provide funding and weapons to them so they can defend themselves and they can promote their agenda, as opposed to sitting back and wondering, well, will the extremists take over, or will Iran support Assad and allow him to keep Syria? We should play an active role.
That doesn't mean sending in troops or dropping bombs, but it does mean actively participating in a place like Syria to assure that Assad goes and that a reasonable and responsible government follows. In other words, toward the Middle East, we have to look nation by nation to say, how could American exert our economic and diplomatic powers, as well as have strong military standing behind our powers and our words, such that people listen and know we can — we can do what we say, in such a way that we help move people towards a more greater degree of freedom and opportunity and hope?
In places like Egypt, for instance, we send billions of dollars there as foreign aid. Well, what's the purpose of that? Are we linking our foreign aid to an American purpose? Are we shaping events there? Should we not say to Egypt, by the way, these funds are conditional upon you honoring the peace treaty you have with Israel? Should we not also say, these dollars are conditional upon you, as the new government, protecting the rights of minorities in your nation, as well as of the opposition party; we don't want to see you killing people that disagree with you; if you do, we won't continue to support you financially, our — our foreign investment in your country.
We'll also jawbone employers in this country to say, look, we want you to invest in — in countries that are following these guidelines because we want to shape events.
America is looking like a nation that is following. They call that, in this administration, leading from behind. I call that following. America is the leader of the free world. That doesn't mean we send troops everywhere and we shoot everybody. It means instead that we use our considerable economic influence and diplomatic influence to try and move nations in ways that will make them more peaceable and provide greater opportunity and hope for their people. This is, in the Middle East, a time of extraordinary opportunity, but also danger, and America sitting on the sidelines is not the right approach.
So my plan is to make sure that we substitute strategy for hope, we actually have a strategy, use our power, our economic and diplomatic power to assure that nations around the world move towards the kind of principles that preserve peace, that open opportunity, that allow people to fulfill their dreams and their potential. And I will be active as a president encouraging a movement towards — towards freedom and opportunity and hope and use our economic muscle to do so.
But let me also note that the world looks to see whether we're serious militarily. I want a military that's so strong that we don't have to use it, because people look at it and say, I don't want to touch that military. [cheers and applause]
Chris has designated himself as batting cleanup, and so far he thinks I'm doing OK. All right, all right.
Yes, ma'am, right there. Oh, well, Carrie has the microphone for you. Hold on just a second. They'll see that — turn that microphone on — what color is that on there? Red. It's the red microphone. Can you turn that up?
Q: Hello.
[inaudible] I believe that you won't raise taxes on all of us, but I'm on the city council here in Mount Vernon. Are you going to take money away from our city and what our tax rate is for something is for something for the federal government? Because we have a balanced budget, and we have a great auditor, Terry Scott, and —
MR. ROMNEY: Where's Terry? Is he in somewhere? There's Terry.
Q: He's right there.
MR. ROMNEY: Hello. Hi, Terry. [applause]
Q: He has gotten awards for 15 years straight in a row for his accounting ability. But that would mess us up if the federal government comes in and starts taking away from us.
MR. ROMNEY: I — I didn't know we could take away from you. I'm not in the federal government, but I — I — I have to tell you, as the governor of my state, I learned that you had to balance budgets. And — and as a businessperson for 25 years, I learned if you don't balance your budget, you go out of business. And when I went to the Olympics and helped guide the Olympics, I learned as well you got to balance the budget here or we'll be in real trouble. And I can't imagine the federal government coming in and saying to you or to any state, we're taking money away from you to help us.
Now sometimes what the federal government does is come in and mandate that you do certain things and then it doesn't provide the funding to do that, and that's another way of — of — [inaudible] — your — your — your potential.
Q: (Off mic.)
MR. ROMNEY: The — the — for those that didn't hear her, she indicated that the — that President Obama is talking about taking away from smaller cities and giving to bigger cities. I'm not familiar with that — with that proposal on his part. I'm not — look, I'm not looking to take away from cities and towns of any scale and having the federal government take from you guys to — to balance the federal budget.
The right course for balancing the federal government is to do two things: Number one, to cut back on spending, to stop programs that we simply can't afford, and number two is to grow the economy, is to get people working again.
I hope we — you know, when you have discussions with politicians about balancing the budget, they only seem to want to talk about taxes and cuts. But there's a third approach that has to be employed, and it's the most powerful. It's growing the economy, because when more people work, more people are paying taxes. And when more people are working, wages tend to go up. And when wages go up, they pay more taxes. So if you want more revenue, why, you want more people working and more taxes being paid by people. That's the most powerful.
And the problem with raising taxes as a way to balance the budget is that you slow down the rate of growth of the economy. And it becomes a self-defeating thing; it's like a dog chasing its tail. You — you never get there. And so what I want to do is cut back on spending and then, through my plans for energy and taxation and for our — our school system and training programs and trade and so forth, get the economy going; get more people working; get rising take-home pay; get home values up. All of these things will help us balance the budget. But I have no plans for taking away from your town, embarrassing your auditor after that great record — [laughter] — and — and try to balance my budget based on your success. Thank you. [applause]
GOV. CHRISTIE: You know, I want to tell you one other thing that I think is really important, to amplify what Governor Romney just said. You will hear from the Democrats all the time that the way to balance the budget is enhanced revenue. Now, of course they don't say "raise taxes," because that's a bad thing. They call it "enhanced revenue." See, when I got to Trenton, I needed a Trenton-to-English dictionary in my state, because they talk in all kinds of different ways. "Enhanced revenue" — well, that means raising taxes.
Now, if raising taxes is the way to do it, everyone should look at New Jersey. Look at New Jersey for the eight years before I became governor, because in the eight years before I became governor, Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature raised taxes and fees at the state level 115 times in eight years — 115 times in eight years.
Just so you understand what that would have meant for you, if you lived in New Jersey, that means there was tax or fee increase for the state every 25 days for eight years. Every 25 days, the government came into your pocket for one thing or another and took more out.
Now, if you agree with that philosophy, then I should have — when I came into office, after eight years of that, should have had a surplus, right? Because if you keep raising taxes all the time, basically that's the way to get more money and you get a surplus.
When I walked into office, my treasurer came to me and said, Governor, if we don't cut $2 billion in spending in the next six weeks, we won't meet payroll for the second pay period in March. New Jersey, the second wealthiest state per capita in America, wasn't going to meet payroll. And then they told me, oh, by the way, when you start working the budget for next year, we have a projected $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget — a 37 percent deficit, the biggest in America.
So if they're right and raising taxes and raising fees is the way to balance the budget, how come I got stuck and the people of New Jersey got stuck after eight years of 115 increases with $13 billion worth of deficits in our first six months? I said this at the convention at the keynote speech, and I absolutely believe it. I'm going to repeat it to you again. This is the truth, the simple truth. You listen to that one example, our ideas, Republican ideas, Governor Romney's ideas are right for America, and their ideas have failed America, and that's why we have to win this election on November 6th. [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: There comes a microphone. And this is a red microphone, I'll bet. Yes, it is.
Q: Hi, Governor Romney.
MR. ROMNEY: Hi.
Q: Mount Vernon is not just a great industrial town here in the area but we're also a college town. We're home to Mount Vernon Nazarene University and Kenyon College. A lot of their College Republicans are sitting right — seated right behind you. [applause]
I guess my question is, as a lot of people my age are getting ready to graduate, we see the way the economy is right now. We see the spending, the huge deficit. What are you going to do as president — and I'm confident that you'll be the next president — what will you do to help America's college students find jobs or create environments for them to go out and get jobs?
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, that's — that's a great question. And — and the parent who has worked hard to help their child go to school and go on to college expected that when their son or daughter came out of college, they'd get a great job. And to find last graduation day that half the kids coming out of college couldn't find work, or work that was full-time work or work that was consistent with a college degree, that broke a lot of hearts.
I don't know how much debt you have and how much debt each of you have. The federal government is providing loans to people so they can go to college, as we should, and in some cases, where people are low-income, provide Pell Grants and that's also helpful. But there are a lot of young people coming out of college with a lot of debt and no job.
I was in Philadelphia some months ago, and a young woman there was pretty emotional about the fact that she was graduating, she had three part-time jobs but very modest income from those part-time jobs, and she said, my student loans come due in six months; I've got to start paying them; I don't begin to have enough money to pay; what am I going to do?
The best thing I can do is to immediately get a boost in this economy such that enterprises small and large conclude that this is a good time to grow and hire people, so that by the time you're coming for a job next May or June in graduation, you'll see employers around the country saying, yeah, we're hiring again; we want to hire people because we think good times are coming, and good times already look like they're coming.
And you might think, well, what are you going to do to make things turn around that fast? Well, number one, electing someone who cares about the economy and understands it is going to create enthusiasm and confidence in America — [applause] — and bring back some — bring back some growth. (Sustained applause.)
And — and number two, and — and — you know, we've spoken about energy for years, but there's something unusual about energy at this stage, and that is, as you know, through new technology and drilling, drilling not just vertically but horizontally, tapping into various pockets of oil and gas, fracking technology that pushes out the oil and gas, compressors that get it into the — the marketplace, we have an opportunity with energy to do something we've spoken about for years but frankly in the past was kind of hard to see how you'd get there. Now we can do it.
In eight years, North — North America could be energy independent. And to get there requires pipelines and pumps and — and — and drilling and lots of jobs in the energy sector, but also in manufacturing like right here and other manufacturing, be — whether it's a chemical industry that uses natural gas as a feedstock; they'll start building facilities here again.
So I — I can, on day one, say to the — the Department of Commerce, to the secretary of commerce, let's start providing permits and licenses to people who've already been approved to drill on federal lands and in federal waters and in Alaska. Let's start building that pipeline from Canada. Let's get these jobs coming into America.
You do that, and by next May or June you're going to see a better employment picture than you're seeing today.
Thank you. We'll get it done. [cheers and applause]
Here's a question over here. I — I've been — I've been going over here, so I'll be back in just a second. I've got a gentleman over here that's ready to ask a question. Thank you. You make engines, jet engines?
Q: Yes.
MR. ROMNEY: Yes.
Q: [inaudible]
MR. ROMNEY: Ah.
Q: Being part of industry, one of the issues we have is the increased competition from China, typically cheaper but inferior parts. What can you do to help us kind of protect ourselves from that constant barrage?
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah. Yeah. Governor, I didn't let you answer after that last question, so I'm going to let you answer — answer both these, all right? All right? I'm not used to having another person onstage with me. I like it, though. It's good. [laughter]
Let me — let me come back to that question about China. And — and I mean, China is a — a major — well, now the number one manufacturer in the world. And — and China's economy is not as large as ours, but it's the second-largest in the world and on track to become larger than ours. It's growing much faster than we are. Last quarter our economy grew at 1.3 percent. Theirs grew at 7 (percent) or 8 percent. So they're gaining fast. And — and they're — they're smart, capable people, and productive.
And what they've done is they've taken advantage of our — our laxity in enforcing fair trade, making sure that we — we — we can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level. But China's been aggressive, and they've done a few things that have made it hard for us, unfair.
One is they've held down the value of their currency artificially. And you might think, well, what difference does that make? Well, that means the prices of their products are artificially low. And when they do that, they're able to win bids or win business away from manufacturers that are paying in dollars.
And — and the result of that is American companies have lost a lot of jobs and gone out of business.
There is something else they do. They counterfeit your products. I — I was with a — a manufacturer that makes valves for industrial uses, (big ?) valves. He said that — that they were showing up as some of their customers and having to replace the valves that had failed, and they were surprised to have their product failing, and it had their serial number on it and their packaging. It turned out it was not their product. It was being counterfeited in China, brought over here as their product with their brand name, and their — you know — [chuckles] — and — and their serial number on it.
And — and this — this is — and then of course, the other way that — that a nation can cheat as they have is hacking into our computers and looking at the designs that Jim has put in place over the years and saying, oh, look, I can take that and take that and take that, put it in our products so they don't have to pay anything for engineering or testing because they just steal someone else's product.
This can't go on. And we've looked the other way for a long time because for a long time China was poor and — and just an emerging economy, and we hoped that they'd do better. Well, now they're serious. They're taking jobs. And — and we've been looking the other way too long.
And so on day one, I will do something which is authorized under our statutes, under our law, which is to label China a currency manipulator and will instruct us to apply tariffs is they are stealing our technology, counterfeiting our products or artificially holding down the — the price of their goods. I — I — we will compete with China, and we will win with most productive, innovative people in the world. [applause] But we will not allow to keep taking our jobs on unfair — [inaudible]. (Sustained applause.) Thank you, (folks ?).
GOV. CHRISTIE: [inaudible] — to your question, too — one of the other things that's going to help us in this regard is what Governor Romney's planning to do regarding energy. You know, as manufacturers, that one of the largest costs we have is the cost of energy here, but we also know that we have 75 to 100 years of natural gas under this country right now. And Governor Romney's talked about us getting energy independent here in North America.
It is so key to unleash the natural gas and the other natural resources we have in the country. It would lower our energy costs, because you know that if we lower your energy costs in manufacturing, that's going to eliminate a lot of these artificial advantages that Governor Romney's talked about China having, and that combined with the stricter enforcement that Governor Romney's talking about is going to be like dropping fuel on a fire for manufacturing in the United States. And you can't — you shouldn't do one without the other, and that's why his five-point plan makes so much sense in terms of job creation.
Because it's not relying on one small niche thing to get the job done, it's saying, we've got to look at the full range of all our energy resources, utilize all of them. We have to work hard on trade to make trade fairer. We have to focus on small business to give them that leg up so they become the bigger businesses as they grow and they innovate and they use their ingenuity. And so the energy issue is just absolutely indivisible for restoring manufacturing jobs in this country again, because when we can make our energy costs lower than anyone else around the world with the natural resources we have and harness here, combined with our ingenuity and the work ethic of our employees, there will be nobody who will be able to stop the United States of America from being the number one manufacturer in the world again. [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, governor. You guys, I want to — I want to just share an experience with you that you will, I think, find touching, as I did, and will mention to you something about my belief in the future of America. I believe in America. I believe not just in the rocks and rills and templed hills, I believe in the people of America.
I believe the people of America will keep this nation strong, will rebuild an economy that's second to none in the world. We're the most productive workforce in the world, the most innovative, and America's going to continue to lead the world and must continue to lead the world for the sake of our kids and for the sake of the world at large. America must remain the leader of the free world, and the free world must remain the leader of the entire world. And I'm confident that's going to happen.
I have seen throughout my life great qualities of the human spirit evidenced in the lives of my fellow Americans, and it's inspired me. I — I was at an event in Atlanta just a couple of weeks ago, and a big crowd of people there, and I noticed that there was kind of an empty section where the — the people had made a gap, and it turned out it was a person in a wheelchair. And so I sort of looked in and waved them forward, and they brought the wheelchair forward, and it turned out it was a classmate of mine from business school. And this is a guy named Billy Hultz . He'd been in a — in an automobile accident — or in an accident, I think it was automobile — but had become quadriplegic. And — and I — I saw him, and he came up and got a little closer.
After his accident, instead of becoming despondent and depressed, he became involved in his business. He got involved in raising money for spinal cord injury research, because he wanted to help other people avoid the tragedy that had occurred in his own life. He didn't give up. He stayed involved. The American spirit, even when the body is weak, is strong. By the way, I placed my hand on Billy's shoulder and leaned down and said to him, Billy, I love you, God bless you. How shocked I was when I learned he passed away the next day.
The American people have passion and heart.
I — this is about two years ago, I think. I was invited to a neighborhood Christmas party. I got one of these fliers in my mailbox, and it said, there's a Christmas party. Everybody should come. You know, come one, come all. And on the night of the announced Christmas party, I noticed the lights in the house kitty-corner from ours were on, and people were on the deck and the porch, and they — they can see our house. Our lights were all on, so they knew we were home. And I figured we had to go over there to make an appearance or they'd think we just, you know, weren't sociable.
So I said to Ann, we got to go over to the party, you know, because it — they won't — wonder why — they'll wonder why we're not there. So we both got sort of dressed up and went over to the party, knocked on the door. They invited us in. It was a great event. They had dinner and — and wonderful friends.
And after a little while, we finally figured out this wasn't the neighborhood party, all right? [laughter] This — this was a — this was some guy having some friends over — [laughter] — and — and we just happened to show up for dinner. [laughter]
And — but I met some wonderful people. [laughter] One was a former Navy SEAL, and I — Glen Doherty, and he — and he — we chatted for a while. He — he came from Massachusetts, where I'd been governor, and had family there. He also skied in some of the places, snow-skiing, that I had found during the Winter Olympics in Utah that I'd skied at, and we had a nice chat together.
He — he served as a Navy SEAL. And — and after his service as a SEAL, after a number of years, he — he had stayed involved helping in the Middle East providing security services to our government and to other enterprises to provide help to them.
And you could imagine how shocked I was to learn that he was one of the two Navy — former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi just a couple of weeks ago. And — and I read on CNN International that when the report came that our consulate had been attacked, that he and the other SEAL that was killed with him, that they were in a different place.
They were about a mile away, in an annex somewhere else in the city. And when they heard that the consulate was under attack, they went to the attack. They didn't hunker down and — and — and hide themselves. No, they went there.
That's what Americans do. When there's a challenge, when there's a threat, we go there. When things are tough, we don't give up; we keep fighting. There's a — there's a — a saying that I've found pretty compelling: Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose. That's Americans. We have clear eyes — we know what we believe; full hearts — we love this country; and we can't lose. This is a time for America to make a choice. With clear eyes and full hearts, we will not lose. We're going to take back this country and keep America the hope of the earth. [cheers and applause] Thank you so very much. Great to be with you. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at a Campaign Event in Delaware, Ohio

October 10, 2012

[cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Four more weeks! Four more weeks!
GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE: All right. Yeah, you got the memo. [cheers and applause]
Well, we are — we are thrilled to be here. We're thrilled to be here in Delaware. And thank you all for turning out. It's so great. And you know you're right. We just got four more weeks to put up with Barack Obama in the White House. [cheers and applause]
We've been traveling all across Ohio together for the last day and a half or so, seen so many wonderful folks who have such great dreams for their children and grandchildren. They want this country to be for those kids what it's been for us. And we're willing to fight for it and sacrifice together to get it. All we need to do is get a leader to lead us there. And we have that person. And I'm thrilled to call him my friend. And you're going to be proud to call him the next president of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney. [cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Chris. And I — I see your state auditor here. Come on, get — get the state auditor up here. Dave Yost, state auditor, a man from Delaware. Come on up here. This is the guy that helped chair my campaign when I — during my primary time. He's a Delaware man. [cheers and applause] Appreciate his help and support. Thank you, Auditor.
And Chris Christie, coming here all the way from New Jersey — can you believe that — to help me out. Isn't that amazing? [cheers and applause] We've been going across Ohio today and asking people questions and taking questions from them. But the question I have for the people of Ohio is this: Can you afford four more years of Barack Obama?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: I — I hope people understand just what he would cost. He would be very expensive for the people of Ohio if he were to get re-elected. I hope people calculate this. I want them on November 6th to — well, if you're early voting, you can start thinking about it right now, which is how much would it cost to have Barack Obama president for four more years? Because I know some things.
There's the Obama economy tax.
That's meant that the income of the average American has gone down by $4,300 a family. We can't afford that.
And then of course there's his plan for Medicare, cutting $716 billion of — out of Medicare. We can't afford that. I will put that money back in Medicare and honor our promises to our seniors. [cheers and applause]
We can't afford "Obamacare." "Obamacare" would cost the average family $2,500 a year more in insurance premiums. I will repeal "Obamacare" and finally get real health care reform in our country. [cheers and applause]
We can't afford a — another series of budget deficits of roughly a trillion dollars a year. I mean, recognize this is not just bad for the economy; it's bad for jobs because as debt gets larger and larger, the economy slows down, we don't put as many people to work. It's also bad for the coming generations. I think it's immoral for us to keep spending massively more than we take in, passing on those burdens to our kids.
But don't forget how much it would cost the people of Ohio in extra interest costs. The calculation is that the president's going to raise taxes on middle-income families by $4,000 a family to pay for that additional interest cost of his budget.
Look, my plan is not to raise those costs on middle-income families. I will not raise tax on middle-income families. We're going to keep taxes low and get them lower, if we can. [cheers and applause]
And I will get them lower. Let me tell you how we can.
I have a plan to cut taxes for middle-income taxpayers. My plan does this: There will be no tax on interest, dividends or capital gains for middle-income families in America. That means — [cheers] — that means you save money, don't have too worry about the government trying to make you to fill out forms to figure out how much interest you got from the bank or — or if you have a mutual fund, what a capital gain was from the mutual fund.
We'll simplify your taxes and make them lower for the middle class.
My commitment is this. My tax plan is this. We will not raise taxes on the American people. We'll lower them. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: Four more years of Barack Obama would also cost you a very different military. Four more years of Barack Obama would mean that our military would see roughly, well, at least 500 billion (dollars) in cuts and, if sequestration is sustained, another 500 billion (dollars) on top of that. Jobs would be lost here in Ohio. Tens of thousands of jobs would be lost here in Ohio. Across the country the job loss would be extraordinary. And of course our military would be devastated, in the words of the secretary of defense. We can't afford that additional cost of Barack Obama. It's one more reason why we're going vote for a change in Washington to keep America strong and to keep those jobs. [cheers and applause]
And let me mention one more thing. I don't think you can afford another doubling of gasoline prices under Barack Obama. [boos] I mean, since he's been president, the price of gasoline has doubled, and that's happened in part because the president has not taken advantage of our energy. When I become president, we're going to double the number of permits on federal lands and federal waters for drilling, make sure that we can get more oil and gas and use our coal and our nuclear, renewables. We're going to have an energy abundance in America and keep our prices more moderate. [applause]
So you guys — I — I don't know what — I — we're going to get some bakery goods in here in a minute, right? We're going to get some good food. [cheers] We — I want to get inside, have some of the goodies here.
But I want thank you for spending some time with us today and ask your friends over the coming — coming days, do you really think we can afford Barack Obama? Ask them that question. Ask, how much more do you think he's going to cost us? How much more in wages going down? How much more in health insurance costs? How much more in gasoline price? How much more in — in weakening our military? How much more in cuts to Medicare?
All these things, Barack Obama is costing the people of Ohio — when they see how much he's — he's costing, they're going to say, you know what, let's just give him four more weeks; it's time for new leadership over the coming four years. [cheers and applause]
We're going to make that happen. Thanks, you guys. Great to be with you. And thanks for welcoming us today. You're very kind. [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Sidney, Ohio

October 10, 2012

Thank you. Wow.
Thank you, Governor John Kasich, for that introduction. Thank you. And my son Josh — what a great guy, huh? [cheers and applause] And thank you to Collin Raye for entertaining everybody this evening. What a great entertainer. Thank you, Collin; appreciate it. [cheers and applause]
Wow, this is quite a crowd. That's an Ohio welcome. Thank you, guys. Great to be here. [cheers and applause]
You know, I've been — I've been seeing some of these rallies for the opposition on TV, and they typically have a chant, "Four more years, four more years." But I checked my calendar. I think it's — four more weeks is a better chant, don't you think? [cheers and applause] This is —
(Chants of "Four More Weeks! Four More Weeks!")
Thanks, you guys. Look, I'm overwhelmed by the number of people here. There are even people out there. That's another county over there, but I appreciate — appreciate the chance to see you way out there. Thanks so much for being here.
I know there's a lot of interest in the campaign these days. People are concerned about what's happening in our country. They want to see better times ahead. And they're coming. I know that a lot of folks are struggling; 23 million people out of work, looking for a better job, struggling to get a better job.
We see one out of six families in poverty; even those that have work, having some tough times, because incomes have come down. The last four years, the median income in America has dropped by $4,300 a family. And with median income around 50,000 bucks, that's a huge drop. And the president promised that he'd get health insurance premiums down $2,500 a family. They're up $2,500 a family. That's a $5,000 difference.
Middle-income families are struggling. Gasoline prices — you've seen those — doubled since he's been president, or more. And these have been tough times.
The president's answer to this is to say he's going to save Big Bird. [laughter] My view is it's time to have a president that'll save the American family and help people across this country have a bright and prosperous future. [cheers and applause]
I've been saying that I don't think we can afford four more years of, well, the last kind of four years we've had. I think people recognize there's a high cost to reelecting President Obama. If we were to reelect him, we'd see chronic unemployment continue. We'd see high gasoline prices continue. We'd see incomes continue to go down. We'd see the kind of fiscal crisis happening here that's happening elsewhere.
We can't afford four more years of Barack Obama. And the key thing I want people across Ohio to understand and to ask themselves, as you go into the voting booth, as you vote, is can we really afford the cost of Barack Obama? And the answer is no.
Now, we had a debate about a week ago, as you may know. [cheers and applause] It was a good experience. [cheers and applause] And it was a chance for people to see what we actually believe, as opposed to just seeing what's on TV in the ads, which don't always characterize accurately our views. And we heard what the president had to say and people heard what I had to say. And they're pretty starkly different.
We both care very deeply about helping the middle class in America and helping get people out of poverty and into the middle class. But our pathways for how to do that couldn't be more different.
He, for instance, wants to raise taxes from 35 percent to 40 percent on about a million of the small businesses in our country. I want to lower taxes on small business to create more jobs. [cheers and applause]
He wants to put in place a more expensive death tax, which, of course, would make it a heck of a lot harder for people to pass farms on to the coming generation. My view is we ought to get rid of the death tax altogether. It's simply not fair. [cheers and applause]
He wants to raise the tax on savings. He wants to make it more expensive to save your money. My view is if you're middle class, making $200,000 a year and less, there should be no tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. Let people save their money without having to pay tax on it. [cheers and applause]
On the export front, you realize, of course — and I know a number of you are in the agricultural community — 23 million American jobs count on agriculture. It's a huge part of our economy. About a million jobs depend on export of agricultural products. And over the last four years, the president has signed no new trade agreements, no new opportunities for America to sell goods outside our nation.
We can compete. Our farmers can compete. Our manufacturers can compete with anyone in the world. But he hasn't opened up these markets for us. I will go to work to get trade promotion authority to open up new trade for America so we can compete on a fair basis across the world and create more jobs here. [cheers and applause]
Now, the president has described his energy policy. He says one thing, but you can look at his record. It's pretty different, because he's been in office for four years and he has cut in about half the permits and licenses that go on federal lands for putting in place oil wells, drilling, whether it's on federal lands, by the way, or federal waters.
My own view is we ought to double the licenses on federal lands and in federal waters for drilling. [cheers and applause] And I want to make sure we drill up in Alaska as well. And I want to get that pipeline in from Canada to take advantage of those resources. [cheers and applause]
His policies will lead to what he said when he was campaigning four years ago. He said, look, if my policies get put in place, the cost of energy will skyrocket. Well, America's farmers can't afford those skyrocketing energy prices. And I'm going to go to work to get North American energy independence so we can have confidence in our future when it comes to energy. [cheers and applause]
There's another place we think very differently. That's with regards to the military. The president has cut the military budget by about half a trillion dollars, and then, through his sequestration idea, another half a trillion on top. The secretary of defense has said these kind of cuts would be devastating.
I will not cut our military commitment. Our military must be second to none. [cheers and applause]
And then there was one more area we talked about differences, and that had to do with jobs and the economy and how to get the economy going. You heard the president's answer. It's basically a continuation of what we've seen over the past four years. He calls it forward. I call it forewarned. (Laughter.
)
He's in favor of another stimulus. How'd the first stimulus work? He wants to hire more government workers. Nothing wrong with government workers, but that's not going to create jobs across America and get us back to work with higher incomes.
He says he also wants to raise taxes. That sure as heck doesn't create jobs. That kills jobs. His tax plan is estimated to cost about 700,000 jobs. My tax plan creates 7 million jobs. So we have very different views. [cheers and applause]
My plan — my plan to get us working again has five key parts, and I mentioned some of them already: Number one, take advantage of coal, oil, gas, nuclear, renewables. Get America strong when it comes to energy. [cheers and applause]
And let us also remember those miners who are trapped. You've heard about that, two miners trapped today in a collapse at a mine. Apparently they're safe. Is that right, Governor, we believe at this stage? Let us keep them in our prayers and thoughts. We want them to come out safely and well.
But we're going to become energy-secure. And, by the way, that creates not just jobs in the energy sector, but also in manufacturing. I was today at a place that makes compressors, great — these monstrous compressors, like four or five bales of hay in a row, great big compressors.
I said what do you use them for? They said, well, you know, when natural gas comes out of the ground, it doesn't naturally flow in a pipe. You've got to push it. You've got to compress it. So they make compressors that push that natural gas.
There's a lot of manufacturing associated with our energy sector. And there are a lot of manufacturers that use energy as a major component in their product. And so having low-cost energy will bring back manufacturing jobs. We've lost over half a million manufacturing jobs during President Obama's term. I want to bring manufacturing back to this country, and energy is one way we'll do it.
Number two, trade. I mentioned trade. I want to open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Latin America has an economy almost the size of China. We're all very excited about the opportunities in China, but don't forget the folks right next door and the advantage we have next door. And, by the way, when China cheats in trade and steals our jobs unfairly, we're going to finally say no and take them — make them accountable. [cheers and applause]
Number three, we've got to make sure our training programs work for the workers of today and the jobs they need. Do you know there are 47 different federal training programs, 47, reporting to eight different federal agencies? Think of all the overhead, all the bureaucracy.
I want to take all the dollars that are spent at these federal training programs and bundle up Ohio's fair share and make sure it comes back to Ohio so Ohio can use it to get jobs for the people in Ohio that need those jobs. [cheers and applause]
Number four, we're going to get a balanced budget. We can't keep on spending more than we take in. It's killing our future. The president's spending too much. I think it's morally wrong for us to spend our kids' future as we're doing. And I'm going to cap federal spending. I'm going to cut federal spending and get us on track to that balanced budget.
And number five, I'm going to champion small business. [cheers and applause] I want to make it easier for small businesses to grow — small businesses, where two thirds of our jobs are created. And when I go across the country and talk to small business folks, they say sometimes they feel that the government is their enemy, not their ally.
I want them to understand that the role of government is to protect our freedoms, to make it easier for enterprisers to get out and begin their businesses and to put people to work. I want regulators to see their job as creating regulations that make markets work, that don't crush the entrepreneurs. I want taxes to be low for entrepreneurs, for people who are building jobs. And, by the way, I want to make sure that "Obamacare" gets out of the way of creating jobs. [cheers and applause]
I want you to know how confident I am in the future. America is an extraordinary nation. We've faced great challenges. But over the last four years, we have not had the kind of strong leadership we needed in Washington to take on our challenges.
Time and again, the president's told us he'd take on some of these things, but hasn't. And then he turns around and tries to blame others. Congress won't get together. Congress won't get together unless there's a strong leader that puts them together. He won't. He hasn't. I will. [cheers and applause]
My confidence in the future comes from the fact that I go across the country and I'm inspired by the people I meet. It's quite a nation.
I was at the Republican convention a few weeks ago and met Jane Horton — Jane, a wonderful woman; her husband a sharpshooter in the Army, sent over to Afghanistan. She's packing up a package for him with some birthday goodies when she gets a knock at the door and learns that he's been killed in Afghanistan. And her reaction is not to become depressed and despondent, but actually to go to work and try and help other families that have lost loved ones in conflict.
And at the time of the funeral of her husband, when his remains were brought back, she was asked what she thought about the people who were there, because this was a time when some of those misguided people were showing up at the funerals of our military officers, military personnel, and protesting.
And she said this. She said — they asked her, what do you think about these people protesting at your husband's funeral? And she said Chris died so people like them can protest.
This is the character of America. We're a big-hearted people. We recognize the greatness of the Constitution and the principles upon which this nation was founded. The president seems to be changing America in ways that many of us don't recognize, making us more and more like Europe. I don't want to become like Europe. Europe doesn't work there. I want America to become more like America. I want to restore the principles that made us the nation we are. [cheers and applause]
(Chants of "USA! USA! USA!")
I'm inspired — I'm inspired by men like Christopher Horton, her husband, and his willingness to serve his country. Would those who are in our armed forces or our veterans please raise your hands so we can recognize you? Thank you. Wow. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
O beautiful, for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved, and mercy more than life. We appreciate our men and women in uniform from today and from the past, and for tomorrow — for tomorrow.
Let me tell you also just an experience I had that reminded me of something about the American character, our pioneering spirit, our willingness to sacrifice for the future, our willingness to reach out and make a difference in the life of others.
This happened to be a — some years ago I was in my home state of Massachusetts and I was attending a Boy Scout court of honor. And there's a Boy Scout back there. [laughter] And a court of honor, for those that are not familiar with it, it's a place where young men who are ready to receive an Eagle are awarded their Eagle, and others who are getting other merit recognitions are able to do so.
I was one of the kind of civilian leaders in our scout program, so I was kind of in the front of the room. They had some formica tables set out, and I was at the far end of the formica table next to the American flag there. And the person who got up to speak at the event was a scoutmaster from Monument, Colorado. And he got up and he talked about his scout troops and how they wanted to have a special American flag. And so they purchased one with gold tassels around the outside.
And they had it flown above their state capitol, as I recall. They sent it also to Washington to have it flown above the Capitol building in Washington. And when it came back, the boys said, hey, one more thing. We'd like it to go on the shuttle, the space shuttle. And so they contacted NASA and said, hey, would you take our flag on the space shuttle? And I'm sure NASA said to them, hey, space is at a premium in space, all right. You can't — we can't just sort of take everybody's souvenirs.
But they relented and they took these boys' flag on the mission and put it in a plastic container, along with, I guess, some coins and metals that other troops and other groups had given them to take on this journey. And the scoutmaster said the boys were so proud as they were in their various homerooms at schools watching the rocket take off and the shuttle go off into the space. And then they saw it explode before their eyes. This was that tragedy that occurred in the Challenger mission.
And he said that he called NASA a couple of weeks later and said have you found any remnant of our flag? We'd like to keep it in memory of those people who sacrificed for our great nation. And they said, no, I'm sorry, we haven't found anything from the flag. And he said he called every week from about — as I recall, it was from, like, February till May or June, just called and called and called every week or so, and every week they said no.
And then about September he said he was reading an article in a paper and it talked about the debris that had been found from the Challenger disaster, and it mentioned something about a flag. So he called NASA and, in fact, they had found a remnant of his flag, of the Boy Scouts' flag.
And so the Boy Scouts and NASA came together and he said we were presented with a plastic container. And we opened that container, and there was our flag in perfect condition. And then he said, and there it is on the flagpole here at the end of the formica table next to Mitt Romney.
And I looked over at that flag and I pulled it out, and it was like electricity was running through my arms as I thought about where that flag had been and I thought about the men and women who sacrificed, who put themselves in danger in exploring space, trying to provide more knowledge for the American people.
It's who we are. We're a people given to great causes. We live our lives for things bigger than ourself, whether in the military, whether in a home with a single mom who's trying to raise a kid or two or three, whether it's a dad who's taking on multiple jobs. In all sorts of ways, Americans give themself for something bigger than themself.
That flag represents that to me. It suggests to me greatness in the American spirit, in the American heart. I know that America's going to come back in every way we must to continue to lead the world. It's our turn. It's our turn as young people here. I call myself young. I'm only 65. [laughter]
You see, the greatest generation gave us this nation. They sacrificed to give us a land with prosperity and freedom, and they held aloft a torch for the world to see, a torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. But there are not as many in the greatest generation as there used to be, and those that are here can't hold the torch as high as they used to. And so it is our turn to take that torch and hold it aloft for the world to see.
We need a strong America with strong values in our homes, with a commitment to principles greater than ourself. We need an economy that's so strong it can provide for our families, and also so strong it can provide for a military that can protect our interests and protect our friends.
I commit, with all my energy, to keeping America strong, to rebuilding the principles in our homes and our communities that lead to a strong economy, to getting our economy working as it should again, and to building a military second to none in the world. These things I will do.
And I need your help. I need your help. [cheers and applause] I need you. I need you to go out and find neighbors who voted for Barack Obama and to get them to come join our team. [cheers and applause] I need you to go out and find people and get them to vote. Get them to vote absentee. Get people voting.
This is a critical election. Ohio could well be the place that elects the next president of the United States. I need you to do that job. [cheers and applause] We're going to win together. We're taking back America. We're going to make sure she remains the hope of the earth.
Thank you so very much. You guys are the very best. Thank you. Thanks so much. [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Asheville, North Carolina

October 11, 2012

This has been quite a day for me and hopefully for many of you. I had the chance of a lifetime. I got to meet Billy Graham today and Franklin Graham. [applause] And I got to listen in person to someone whose music I've heard for a long time, Ronnie Milsap. Thank you, Ronnie, for performing tonight. [applause] And I'll tell you, those words from Speaker Boehner and also from Mike Huckabee, that warmed my heart. What friends they are! Thanks, guys! [applause]
Now, I know you had the chance a moment ago to hear from Congressman Patrick McHenry. He's going to get reelected and you're also going to elect someone else here. We're going to get Mark Meadows elected as the next congressman in this district. [applause] And going along with Governor Pat McCrory will be your new lieutenant governor who's here also, Dan Forrest. Thanks, Dan. [applause]
Now, I enjoyed my debate about a week ago. That was a good experience. [applause] And I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy tonight's debate as well. [applause] Because Paul Ryan and I are talking about substance and issues that matter to the American people. And this opportunity for us to meet with people across the country has brought more and more people to our campaign because we recognize that America faces real challenges and we have a president and vice president that just aren't up for the job. And so, on November 6th, we're going to send them home. [applause]
I got to — I got to ask the president some questions I know people across America have been asking. For instance, why is it with 23 million Americans out of work or stopped looking for work he spent his first two years working on "Obamacare." I asked him why it was with trillion-dollar deficits he put $90 billion into green energy companies, why it was with gasoline prices twice as high as they'd been when he took office he cut in half the permits and the licenses on federal lands and in federal waters for drilling for oil and gas.
I was able to ask why it is that he promised that health insurance premiums for the average family would decline by $2,500 a year by now and instead they've gone up by $2,500. And you know, for a median income family, that difference, that $5,000 difference makes a huge difference. So I got to ask him those questions and we heard his answers, or his non-answers as the case may be. And we did hear during his campaign, he said this. He said, you know, you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only do it from the outside. Well, we're here to take him at his word for that. Send him home and let him do it from the outside. [applause]
And you know, Mike Huckabee made a good point just a moment ago. You know, he mentioned the number of people that are out of work and he mentioned also that we've got 47 million people today on food stamps. There were only 32 million on food stamps when the president took office, more people in poverty, 1 out of 6 Americans in poverty today. And against that kind of backdrop, we have a president talking about saving Big Bird. I think it's time to have a president who will talk about saving the American family and I will. [applause]
I think — I think today we got another indication of how President Obama and his campaign fail to grasp the seriousness of the challenges that we face here in America. His campaign said this today about the Benghazi terrorist attack. They said this, and I quote, "The entire reason this has become the political topic it is is because of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan."
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: No, President Obama. It's an issue because this is the first time in 33 years that a United States ambassador has been assassinated. Mr. President, this is an issue because we were attacked successfully by terrorists on the anniversary of 9/11. President Obama, this is an issue because Americans wonder why it was it took so long for you and your administration to admit that this was a terrorist attack. [applause]
This is a very — this is a very serious issue. These are very serious questions and the American people deserve serious answers and I hope they come soon. [applause] Now, in our — in our debate, we got to talk about some differences between us because that's one thing we agreed upon. And that is that we have a very different vision for the future of America and I hope you're able to pick that out.
If President Obama were able to get reelected, why, he would raise taxes. He's made it very clear. The vice president blurted out the truth the other day. They're planning on raising taxes a trillion dollars on small business and on individuals. The estimate —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: The estimate is their tax plan will cost 700,000 jobs. I make this commitment. I will not raise taxes on small business or on the middle class in America. We're going to keep our taxes down. [applause] If the — if the president were to be reelected, why, he made a promise that he's going to install "Obamacare." That's going to cost an extra $2,500 per year in your health insurance premiums. I instead will repeal and replace "Obamacare" to help hold down the cost of health care and health insurance. [applause]
If the president is reelected, why, he made it very clear he's going to cut Medicare by $716 billion. I will restore Medicare funding and honor the promise made to our seniors. [applause] If the president — if the president gets his way and is reelected, why, he'll cut military spending by hundreds of billions of dollars —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: He'll also see a sequester, which was the idea of the White House, which would cut it hundreds of billions more. My own view is this. I will not cut our defense funding. I'll make sure we have a military second to none in the world. [applause] And then — and then, we were — and then, we were asked about jobs and how we'd get more jobs in our economy, more people working, more take-home pay.
And the president actually described what he's been saying for the last four years which is he wants another stimulus. How'd the first one work out, all right? And he wants to hire some more government workers. Nothing wrong with that except that's not going to get this economy going. He said as well that he wants to raise taxes. He's going to make some investments. Remember the investments he made in Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Inner-One?
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: A friend of mine said he doesn't want to pick winners and losers. He just wants to pick losers. He calls — he calls his plan forward. I call it forewarned, all right? We don't want to go down that road anymore. This president — this president says he wants to fundamentally change America. I don't want to change America. I want to restore the principles that made America the hope of the Earth. [applause]
This nation's economy — this nation's economy is not driven by government.
This nation's economy is driven by free people pursuing their dreams. It is freedom — [applause]. When the Founders crafted the founding documents of our country, they were both brilliant and I believed inspired because they said our rights came not from government but from God. [applause]
And among our rights were life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the right in this nation for individuals to pursue their dreams as they choose and dreamers coming here from all over the world have helped build the most powerful economy in the world. I do not want to change America's foundation. I want to make it stronger. I will restore the principles that will get our economy going and create the jobs and take-home pay the American people deserve. [applause]
And there are five — you've heard me. There are five things I'll do that will get this economy going in a major way. Number one, we're going to take full advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. [applause] Number two — number two, we're going to make sure that trade works for us. We can compete successfully with anyone in the world. I want to open up new markets for our goods. But when people cheat like China has cheated, we will put an end to that. I will stop it as effectively as I possibly can. [applause]
Number three — number three, we're going to make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed. And for that to happen, we have to have good training programs. By the way, there are 47 federal training programs reporting to eight different federal agencies. You can think of the waste and the inefficiency. I want to take those 47 programs, take the money from them, make sure that North Carolina gets it fair share for that money and you craft your own programs for your own people in the way you think best. [applause]
And to make sure we have those skills to succeed, I want our kids to have skills they need to succeed and that means our schools have to be — have to be a lot better than we've been seeing over the past several years. It's an embarrassment that our schools are performing at the bottom third or bottom quartile of the world. And so what I'm going to do is this. I'm going to make sure we put our kids first and the parents first and the teachers first and the teachers union is going to go behind. [applause]
Number four — number four, to create these jobs, we're going to have to convince entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to grow in America, to invest in America, to hire in America. And for them to do that, they have to be convinced that we're not on the road to Greece. And this president's spending and borrowing has put us on that road. That's why I will cut federal spending. I will cap it and get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause]
And number five — number five, I will champion small business. I want to help small business grow and thrive. [applause] And to do that, unlike the president, I'll keep taxes down on small business and I'll get regulators to see their job as helping small business grow as opposed to crushing them with excessive regulation. And by the way, there's something — there's something which hangs out over small business right now, a big cloud. And that — this big cloud that's hurting small business is "Obamacare." It's one more reason that we've got to get rid of it. [applause]
If we do those five things, when I do those five things, when I'm president of the United States and do those five things — [applause] — we're going to create 12 million jobs. We're going to create 12 million jobs, get rising take-home pay again. We can do that. We can be there. I'm confident in the future of this country. I have seen the passion of the American people. Your willingness to be here this evening and brave the long lines to get in here, you care not about me or even Mike or the speaker. You care about America. That's what brings you here. [applause]
Throughout my life, I've had the chance throughout my life to see something about the character of the American people and you've seen it as well in your workplace and around you. I was at the Republican Convention not terribly long ago and when I was there I met a lovely woman named Jane Horton. Jane's husband, a sharpshooting serving in Afghanistan — on the day she's packing together a care gift to go to him on his birthday, a knock comes at her door and her husband's been killed in Afghanistan.
And she prepares to receive his body back in the United States and they have a funeral service. And this was at a time when some misguided souls were out protesting at the funerals of our servicemen and women. And she was asked —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: She was asked this. She said how do you feel about these people protesting at your husband's service. And she said this, and I quote. She said, "Chris died for them to be able to protest." This is the character of the American people. [applause] We're a people — we're a people of big hearts, big hearts and sound principles, people who live for something bigger than ourselves. I was a number of years ago back in Massachusetts. I had the chance to be part of a Boy Scout cord of honor. [applause]
And some of you know what that is. It's a chance for our Boy Scouts to get their Eagle Scout awards or to get other awards leading up to an eagle. And I was one of the leaders in the Boy Scout effort and so they had these Formica tables up front and I was seated at the far end of the table next to the American flag. And the speaker who was speaking was the scoutmaster from Monument, Colorado. And he described how their Boy Scout troop wanted to have a very special American flag.
So they bought one with gold tassels around it and they had it flown above the state capital as I recall and they sent it to Washington to have it flown above the national capital which it was. And then the boys had an idea. They said, hey, can we have that flag flown — go up on the space shuttle. And so they contacted NASA. And you know, space is kind of at a premium in space. So I'm sure NASA wasn't wild about taking souvenirs on the space shuttle. But they agreed. They took the boys' flag with them on the space shuttle.
And the scoutmaster said, you can't imagine how proud our boys were to watch from their homeroom as they saw that space shuttle take off and they knew their flag was on it until they saw that space shuttle explode before their eyes on TV. And he said he called NASA and he said, have you found any remnant of our flag. And they hadn't. He said he called every week. I think it was from February until, like, May or later. He called every week — have you found some part of our flag — no, no, no.
And then, in sometime — I think in September or so, he was reading an article in the newspaper that said something about a flag being in some of the debris that was recovered. And so he contacted NASA and said, have you found our flag. And they came back and said, well, as a matter of fact we have. And so, they got NASA together with this Boy Scout troop and then they presented the Boy Scout troop with a plastic container and in the container they opened it up and he said, there was our flag in perfect condition. [applause]
And then he said this. He said, that's the flag on the flagpole next to Mr. Romney right here. And I reached over and pulled out that flag and as I touched that flag it was as if electricity was running through my arm because I thought about the men and women in our space program who put themselves in harm's way out of a desire to discovery, to learn, to pioneer. It's part of the American spirit to live for something bigger than ourselves. We do that day in and day out. [applause]
We've got — we've got dads — we've got dads in America today that are doing two jobs, two jobs so they can afford to give their kids the kind of clothes their kids need to fit in at school. We've got single moms that are working real hard to make sure that their child is able to have food on the table at the end of the week. We've got — we've got parents that don't exchange gifts with each other for birthdays or for Christmas so they can make sure and provide a Christmas for their kids.
The American people give for their kids. They give for their country. We're a patriotic people. We love America. We live for something bigger than ourselves. That is the nature of America. [applause] And this is a critical time. This is a critical time for America. We face extraordinary challenges, challenges in foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East, challenge at home with people who need good jobs. This is a time when the American people are going to have to grab the torch.
You see, the greatest generation held aloft a torch for the world to see, a torch of liberty and opportunity and human rights and freedom. But there are not as many in the greatest generation as there used to be. And those that are here can't hold a torch as high as they used to because of their age. It's our turn. We've got to grab that torch and hold it aloft. And I'm counting on you to help me do that. [applause]
This is time — this is time for North Carolina, for the entire country to come together and say we're taking America back. We're going to strengthen our families. We're going to strengthen our values. We're going to strengthen our economy. We're going to strengthen our military. We're going to make sure that America has the capacity to lead the world and to care for our families. I love America! I believe in you! I believe in America! We're going to take back this country and keep it the hope of the Earth! Thank you so very much! You guys are the best! Thank you! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks with Paul Ryan at a Campaign Event in Lancaster, Ohio

October 12, 2012

SENATOR ROB PORTMAN (R-OH): Fairfield County, are you ready to win? We have to win, don't we, folks? It's too important to our families, to our community, to our country. We cannot afford another four years of Barack Obama. [applause] Now, we all want to win and we have to win. But let me ask you something today. Are you planning to do everything you possibly can in the next 25 days to ensure a victory here in the key state of Ohio?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
SEN. PORTMAN: Are you willing to make phone calls for Mitt?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
SEN. PORTMAN: Are you willing to go door to door for Mitt?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
SEN. PORTMAN: Are you willing to put up one of these signs in your yard for Mitt?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
SEN. PORTMAN: I need you to early vote, folks. We need to bank the votes. Go to your board of elections on Monday morning. Walk in. You can vote and vote now. That ensures that you're going to have plenty of time on Election Day to help us get other people to vote. Will you do that? [applause]
I think when you talk to people — your friends and your neighbors, folks you go to work with, folks you go to church with — you'll find that they're paying attention. And one reason is we've had two great debates in the last eight days. You agree with me on that? [applause]
Wow. The American people are seeing what this comeback team is all about. [applause] Last night, we had a terrific performance by Paul Ryan. [applause] Folks, on the stage last night, who was the leader there? It was Paul Ryan. [applause] Joe Biden said a lot of interesting things. One was at a time of increasing danger all around the world, he said we ought to be cutting our military.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
SEN. PORTMAN: Specifically, he said that we don't need any more M-1 tanks. Did you hear that? Guess where those tanks are made, folks? Right here in the state of Ohio. We need M-1 tanks because they're part of the greatest military on the face of the Earth. They will ensure that we have a military second to none so that we can keep the peace. We need M-1 tanks. [applause] Say it ain't so, Joe.
Now, we also saw on the stage last night a guy who understands how to get America back on track. Just as Mitt Romney did last week, he explained why it was so important for us to have a change in direction and he laid out a specific agenda to move America forward. The comeback team is here, folks, and we need them and we need them now. Please help me welcome the next vice president of the United States, Paul Ryan. [applause]
REPRESENTATIVE PAUL RYAN (R-WI): Wow, thank you, buddy! Man, way up there, how you doing? Look at that! Wow. O-H!
AUDIENCE: I-O!
REP. RYAN: God, I love that. That is so fun. It is great to be back here. You know, I just saw a nice Miami sweatshirt. I spent four great years at Miami of Ohio. [applause] It is so great to see that. And I have my Rob Portman-provided lucky Buckeye with me. [applause] He had this Buckeye in his pocket throughout his entire campaign in 2010. He said it brought him great luck and it brought him a victory in Ohio. And you're going to help us because this Buckeye is going to bring us a victory in Ohio, isn't it? [applause]
Lancaster, thank you for having us. you have a huge choice to make. We have a big choice to make. You know, I think we saw a sign of it last night just like we saw it a week ago. You see, they are offering no new ideas. The president is simply saying more of the same. Hope and change has become attack and blame. [applause] When he was running for president four years ago, Barack Obama gave a huge speech and in this big great speech he said if you don't have fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters.
If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as somebody people should run from. You make a big election about small things. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what Barack Obama said of his opponent four years ago when he ran for president. And that is exactly what Barack Obama has become now as president. [applause]
You know, we had a little chat about Libya and Benghazi. We mourn the loss of these four brave Americans. But talking about blaming — first, they blame a YouTube video and a nonexistent riot. Then when the country is getting upset about it, they blame Romney and Ryan for getting people upset about it. They keep changing their story. This is not what leadership looks like. We need clarity, not confusion. We need accountability and no more excuses. [applause]
This tragedy would be troubling in and of itself and tragic in and of itself. But unfortunately what we are witnessing when we turn on our T.V.s on a daily basis is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we are!
REP. RYAN: And when you say it's OK to impose these devastating cuts in our military or that we don't need any more Lima-built M-1 tanks, what we are doing is we are projecting weakness. And when we project weakness abroad, our enemies become more brazen. Our enemies are more tempted to test us. And our allies are less willing to trust us. So while hotspots are growing abroad, the economy is not growing here at home. And that's the problem we have to focus on here.
You see, the economy is growing slower than it grew last year and last year it grew slower than the year before. And all President Obama is offering is more of the same. So we have a very big choice to make and that choice is clear. Do we want more stagnation that fosters dependency or do we want a dynamic growing economy that creates opportunity and creates jobs? [applause] In a nutshell, we need leadership. [applause]
And look at the guy over my shoulder right here. [applause] If you look at this man's life story, one word comes to mind: leader. This is a man who turned around the Olympics, who turned around struggling businesses — and by the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing. There's nothing wrong with that. We want more people to be successful. We want more people to have prosperity, to have jobs, to have higher take-home pay. We want people to grow.
At a time when America has a jobs crisis, wouldn't it be nice to have a job creator in the White House? [applause] And this is a man who has proven to get things done. When he was governor of Massachusetts, he cut taxes 19 times. He balanced the budget without raising taxes.
Unemployment went down. Household income went up. This is a man who knows how to turn things around. And by the way, after getting the runaround for four years, don't you think it's time for America to have a turnaround? [applause]
We will not duck these tough issues facing our country because if we don't tackle America's problems, they will tackle us. We will not spend the next four years blaming other people. We will take responsibility and get the job done. [applause] And we will not try to transform this country into something it was never intended to be. We will reapply our founding principles and make America what it was meant to be — that land of opportunity, that land of freedom and liberty. [applause]
The moment is coming. It's less than a month away. We have a real leader, a perfect person where the man and the moment are meeting perfectly well. That means right here, right here in Ohio, you have the ability and the responsibility and the opportunity to save this country, to get it back on the right track. And you're going to do that by electing this man, Mitt Romney, the next president of the United States. [applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Lancaster! Thank you! Thank you! What a welcome. Thank you! Thank you to Congressman Steve Stivers for being here and welcoming you today. And thank you for your senators. It's great to have Rob Portman here and thank you for this great vice president. He's going to be terrific, isn't he? [applause]
Now, it's good to be back. And you may say, I don't remember seeing you here before. But I was here a long time ago. As a matter of fact, my very first assignment at my first job was to come to Lancaster. I'm serious. And to try and do a little work at a little company called Anchor Hawking. Anyone? [applause]
Yeah, and so for about — I think it was about six months we used to fly into Columbus and then drive an hour-and-a-half or so here and I learned something about standing in those big — next to those big glass furnaces. You know, it got real hot in there. And learned about triple gob machines and saw an extraordinary community that came together to build a great enterprise. And it's good to be back. And this is our — this is our comeback team here. And this is our comeback team in Ohio and we're going to bring back America. [applause]
I've had the fun of going back and forth across Ohio and this week I was also in Florida and Iowa. I was in North Carolina, in Virginia. And you know what, there's a growing crescendo of enthusiasm. People recognize this is not an ordinary campaign. This is a critical time for the country. There's more energy and passion. People are getting behind this campaign. We're taking back this country. We're going to get it strong again. [applause]
And part of that I think came — part of that came from last night. Gosh, we got to watch this guy debate. And there was one person on the stage with thoughtfulness who was respectful, who was steady and poised. There's one person on that stage you'd want to be with if there were a crisis and it's this man right here. [applause] And when the — and when the moderator asked how you'd get the economy going, one person on the stage just attacked. But this guy stood up and — well, it was sitting down, I guess. But metaphorically he stood up and he went through all the things he'd do to get this economy going. It's our plan to get this economy going with more jobs for the middle class and more take-home pay and we're going to bring back this economy by putting in place that plan. [applause]
Now, I also had a debate about a week ago and that — [applause] — I enjoyed that experience. We got a chance to talk about some differences between us. I got to ask the president some questions a lot of people have wanted to ask him like why with 23 million Americans out of work when he took office, struggling to find work, why instead of focusing on getting them jobs he focused on "Obamacare." I got to ask him questions like how come with gasoline so expensive, with it almost twice as much as when he took office, why it was that he cut in half the number of permits for drilling on federal lands and in federal waters.
I got to ask why it was when he called the massive deficit we have un-American and I understand it. Look, the deficit spending has been just outrageous under Republicans and Democrats. But why when that was the case he spent $90 billion sending money to green energy companies, many of whom were owned by friends of his, contributors of his. And you know, we heard what he had to say, or not say. I think we'd boil it down to this. He said — more recently, he said, look, you can't change Washington from the inside. You've got to change it from the outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance on November the 6th. [applause]
Now, there were a couple of places where we agreed. We agreed, for instance, that we would take this country in very different directions. And he points out that — well, actually it was the vice president that blurted out the truth that they're planning on raising taxes by a trillion. Actually, it's more like 2 trillion with the "Obamacare" taxes.
There's no question but that there's spending and the interest on the debt that they amass by virtue of their spending will do what one recent study showed and that is it's going to cause them to raise taxes on the middle class. And I make this commitment to you. Under no circumstances will I raise taxes on the middle class of America. [applause]
Under his path, we're going to have "Obamacare" installed. And let me tell you what that means. That means a bureaucrat's going to tell you ultimately what kind of treatment you can have. It also means that your health insurance premiums are going to be $2,500 more expensive. I mean, you listen to the president. He tells you all these free things you're getting with "Obamacare." But those free things come with a $2,500 extra charge. What I'm going to do is repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with something that actually works for the American people. [applause]
And I hope you listened carefully also in my debate and then in Paul Ryan's debate because the president, he's pointing out in fact they are cutting $716 billion from Medicare, from current Medicare beneficiaries. Under our team, we're putting that money back. We're going to honor the promises made to our seniors. [applause]
And one more thing that Senator Portman mentioned. He has in his budget cutting our military by hundreds of billions. That's the president has that, not Senator Portman. And then in addition there was that sequester idea the White House had to cut another several hundred billion. They'll cut about a trillion dollars from our military. The secretary of Defense has said that those cuts would be devastating to America, to our military, to our national security. I will not make those cuts. I will not cut our military. I'll keep it second to none in the world. [applause]
And when it came to jobs, both last night with Vice President Biden and in my debate with President Obama, they didn't have a plan for creating jobs for middle income Americans. They say they care about middle income Americans and I believe they care, they just don't know what to do. And so they say, well, they're going to another stimulus. How'd that last one work out, all right? And they say they're going to hire more government workers.
There's nothing wrong with government workers. But that's not going to get this economy going. And then, of course, they've got plans to make investments, they say. A friend of mine said they don't want to pick winners and losers. They just pick losers. And then — and then, of course, they want to raise taxes. I don't think anyone believes raising taxes creates more jobs.
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: They just don't understand what it takes to get this economy going and we have a plan, five key elements. And Paul spoke about them last night. Let me mention number one, we're taking full advantage of our oil, our coal, our natural gas, our nuclear, our renewables.
We're going to take advantage of our energy and that'll protect and grow energy jobs and also manufacturing. There are a lot of manufacturing jobs including in the glass industry that use a lot of energy. And when energy is less expensive jobs come back here. We keep — under President Obama, we've lost 600,000 manufacturing jobs. We want to bring jobs back home to America. That's number one.
Number two — number two, we're going to make trade work for us. And so, we're going to open up new markets for our goods. But if people cheat like China has cheated, we're going to stop it. [applause]
Number three, I want training programs that help our people have the skills they need to succeed and I want our schools to be giving our kids the kind of education they need for the jobs of tomorrow. And that means we've got to put our kids first and our parents first and teachers first and the teachers union is going to have to go behind. [applause]
Number four, you're not going to get entrepreneurs to risk their life savings to start a small business or big companies to come to America and build a big factory and hire Americans if they think we're on the road to Greece. And if we keep on spending every year a trillion dollars more than we take in, Greece is where we're headed. And that's why Paul Ryan and I will cut federal spending. We'll cap federal spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. [applause]
And number five — number five is this. We're going to champion small business. We're going to help small entrepreneurs build their businesses. And to do that, we're going to keep their taxes down and get their regulations to encourage growth and take that big cloud of "Obamacare" off of small business. We're going to help small business in America. [applause] We do those five things and 12 million jobs grow in America and take-home pay starts going up again. Do you realize that under President Obama every year — not just his first year — every year the median income in America keeps coming down, down, down.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Throw him out!
MR. ROMNEY: The middle class in America is getting crushed, squeezed because incomes are down. At the same time, gasoline prices are up. Food prices are up. Health insurance premiums are up. It's really tough being middle class even if you have a job in America. And so, we're going to go to work to create more jobs and more take-home pay. That is our passion. That's why we're in this race. We need a strong America so that we can provide for our families and for the future of this great country.
And I want you to know — I want you to know that I'm confident that we're going to overcome the challenges we have. I've seen the heart of the American people throughout my life. I know something about the character of those who have great qualities of the human spirit in their heart. And we've stood up regardless of the challenges America has faced. We've been there and overcome them.
I'm reminded of a couple of experiences, one at the Republican Convention just a few months ago. I met Jane Horton there. Jane's husband, sharpshooter, Afghanistan — on the day she's packing a birthday box for him to send to him in Afghanistan, a knock comes at the door to inform her that he has been killed in Afghanistan. Instead of becoming despondent and depressed, she decides that she's going to devote herself to helping families of others who've lost loved ones in conflict.
And on the day of her husband's funeral, some of those misguided souls came there to protest the funeral. And she was asked what do you think about these people. And she said this, and I quote: "Chris died for them to be able to protest." Isn't that amazing American spirit? Isn't that an amazing person, amazing woman? I love our — [applause]. I love our men and women in uniform and their families that sacrifice so deeply for this country.
I love one of the lines from a national hymn of ours: O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Would our veterans and members of the Armed Services please raise your hand so we can recognize you? Thank you. [applause]
Let me mention another experience I had. And that was, oh, some years ago I was working with the Boy Scouts of America at the time and was at a court of honor. For those who don't know what that is, that's where the Boy Scouts get their Eagle Awards or other awards. And there was a Formica table set up in the gymnasium and I was seated at the end of the Formica table and there was a flagpole there with a flag next to me.
And the person who was speaking was the Boy Scout scoutmaster from Monument, Colorado. And he said that his Boy Scout troop had wanted to have a very special American flag. So they bought one, gold tassels around the outside. They had it flown above the state capitol, as I recall. And they had it flown above the national capitol in Washington, D.C. When it came home, they said, hey, let's have it go up on the space shuttle.
So they contacted NASA and said, would you take our flag on the space shuttle. And I'm sure they told them that space comes at a premium in space, you know. It's not a lot of room for souvenirs in the space shuttle. But they took it. They took their flag. And he said, you can't imagine how proud our boys were from their school rooms to watch the shuttle take off and go up in the sky on T.V. And then they saw it explode before their eyes.
And the scoutmaster said he called NASA a couple of weeks later and said, did you find any remnant of our flag. And they said, no. He said he called every week for several months, called and called — nothing. And then, come September, he said he was reading in a newspaper some of the debris found from the Challenger disaster and they mentioned something about a flag. So he called and said, did you find our flag. They said, as a matter of fact, and so they got together. NASA came together with the Boy Scout troop and presented the boys with this plastic box.
And they opened it and there was their flag in perfect condition. And they said this. He said, that's it on the flagpole next to Mr. Romney at the end of the table. And I reached over and I grabbed that flag and held it out and it was like electricity ran through my arm because for me, that flag represented the men and women who put themselves in harm's way in our space program, in our military, those who reach for learning, who live for something bigger than themselves, who look for discovery, who put themselves out there.
It reminds me of the people who when they graduate from college or high school say, you know what, I'm going to put aside my career for a while and I'm going to go into the military, serve our country. It reminds me of the dads who are working two jobs so they can make enough money so their kids have the kind of clothes the other kids are wearing at school. It reminds me of those single moms who are wondering how they can put food on the table at the end of the week and scrimp and save to be able to do so, the couples who say we're not going to exchange Christmas gifts among ourselves because we want our kids to have Christmas.
This is America. This is who we are. We're a people who live for big things, who care about the future, for our kids, for our nation, for liberty. This is a critical time for America. It's a time when we have to decide what we're going to be. President Obama wants a bigger and bigger government, more and more encompassing, more and more intrusive in our lives. That's not what makes America America. It's freedom that drives America. It's free people. [applause]
We stand on the shoulders of the greatest generation. My mom and dad and your moms and dads, the fought, protected us, gave us a nation that's free and prosperous, the most prosperous nation in the world. They held a torch for the whole world to see, a torch of liberty and hope and opportunity. There are not as many of them as there are — as there were. And they can't hold the torch as high as they used to. It's our turn. We've got to grab that torch. We've got to take it in. It's our honor. It's our honor to be able to do so. [applause] And so I come to you with this commitment.
When Paul Ryan — when Paul Ryan and I become president and vice president, and I mean when we become president and vice president — [applause] — we will do everything in our power to keep America strong, to restore the values that make our homes the center of our society, to keep our economy strong and to have a military so strong no one would ever think of testing it.
That's the America we see. We make that commitment to you. We need your help. We need to win Ohio. You've got to get your friends to help us win Ohio. We win Ohio, we take back America, we keep this country the hope of the Earth. Thank you so very much, you guys! Lancaster, you're the best! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Richmond, Virginia

October 12, 2012

MITT ROMNEY: Wow. That's another great Virginia welcome. Thank you so much. Great to be with you. [cheers and applause] Wow.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you so much. You know, there's another — there's another cheer going around. I — now and then I see these Obama rallies, and they're chanting, four more years. Our cheer is four more weeks, all right — [laughter] — so — [cheers] — we're — we're getting ready for a change. [applause]
I want to — I want to thank Jett Williams for entertaining us, all right? That was wonderful, and I appreciate her doing so. [applause] Bringing her great talent here was just wonderful. I want to thank the governor. Bob McDonnell is here. Maureen, the first lady, is also here. Thank you. [cheers] Our first lady, there she is right there in her red jacket waving her hand — [applause] — thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a wonderful friend, a terrific man, a great leader, is also here.
Thank you. [cheers and applause] And you got a chance to hear from Ken a moment ago. Congressman Forbes — need to re-elect him, right? We're going to get that job done. [cheers and applause] Yeah.
Now, did you get a chance to watch the debate last night? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Yeah, I — I think you might agree with me that there was one person onstage last night who was thoughtful and respectful, steady and poised, the kind of person you want to turn to in — in a crisis. And that was the next vice president of the United States, Paul Ryan. [cheers and applause]
There was also one person on the stage who actually, when asked what he'd do to get the economy going again, had an answer. And he — he laid out our five-point plan to get this economy going. And — and the other candidate, of course, just attacked. But the American people are — are looking for answers, not attacks.
The — the — we had a chance to talk about what was happening in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And — and the unemployment rate there has gone up to 10 percent. And — and we were — recognize this is unacceptable. The fact that we have 23 million Americans out of work — this is not — this is not just something that — that is a statistic. These are real families. These are people with a real — with a real life and are concerned about their future. And that's why Paul Ryan and I care about each and every American that's out of work, and we're going to do everything in — in our power to get Americans back to work again. [cheers and applause]
Now, the — the vice president defends the status quo. We're going to fix the status quo and make things better.
Now, by the way, yesterday I raised some questions about Benghazi and the — and the tragedy that occurred there. And there were — there were more questions that came out of last night because the vice president directly contradicted the sworn testimony of State Department officials. He — he's doubling down on denial.
And — and we need to understand exactly what happened, as opposed to just have people brush this aside. When the vice president of the United States directly contradicts the testimony — sworn testimony of State Department officials, American citizens have a right to know just what's going on. And we're going to find out. And this is a time for us to make sure we do find out. [cheers and applause]
Now, I must admit I also enjoyed my own debate about a week ago. It was a good experience. [cheers and applause] Like — like last night, it was a debate of substance. And I got to ask the president some questions that people across the country have been wanting to ask the — the president. I — I got to ask him why was it — with 23 million Americans struggling to find a job, why was it he focused his first three years on "Obamacare," which makes it harder to create jobs? Why was it, with — with gasoline at — at about twice the price as when he came in, that he couldn't half the number of permits on — for drilling on public lands, why he said no to the Keystone pipeline? I asked more questions, just like why was it, with a trillion-dollar deficit, he found it in his — in his heart to put $90 billion into green energy companies that in many cases were contributors to his campaign, at least the owners of those — those businesses were. And why — and why was it, with — what he had promised during his campaign, that health insurance premiums he'd bring by $2,500 a year; instead they went up by $2,500 a year?
And — and so — you know, I know we've heard his answers over the campaign. He says, look, you can't fix Washington from the inside; you can only do it from the outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance, all right? [cheers and applause]
And you know, with some 47 million Americans on food stamps — a record number, by the way. When he took office there were 32 million on food stamps, now 47 (million). Their lives are not getting better. They're not better off than they were four years ago. And so with that set in, with one out of six people living in poverty, with half our kids coming out of college not able to get a job or a college level job, his campaign has been focusing on saving Big Bird. [laughter] My campaign is going to focus on saving the American family and getting us good jobs and rising incomes again. [cheers and applause]
Now, I think the president and I could agree on some things. We can agree that if he's re-elected, he's going to raise your taxes. And I don't just mean, by the way, taxes on a small number of people. There's been a study done recently that shows that with all the spending he's planning and of all the interest on the debt that's associated with all that spending that he's going to have to raise taxes on middle-income Americans again. He's already done that with "Obamacare," but he's going to have to keep raising taxes of middle-income people. Let me tell you this: I will not raise taxes on the middle class of the America, and I won't raise taxes on small business. [cheers and applause]
If he were to get re-elected, of course, he's going to install "Obamacare" and — [booing] — I just spoke with one of the customers here at this mobility super center and he said to me, look, you've — you've got to stop "Obamacare." There are a lot of reasons for wanting to do that. One is that "Obamacare" is going to cost you an extra $2,500 a year. That's according to the Congressional Budget Office. It's going to make — it's going to make insurance that much more expensive.
If I'm president, we're going to replace "Obamacare," we're going to repeal "Obamacare," and we're going to do something that helps hold down the cost of health care. [cheers and applause]
We saw something else. If the president were to get re-elected, he will cut Medicare by $716 billion. [boos] I'll put that money back into Medicare and make sure that we honor the promises that we made to our seniors. [cheers and applause]
And something else that was spoken about last night in some depth, and that is the president has a budget that cuts our military by hundreds of billions of dollars — [booing] — and then — and then this sequester idea that came from the White House, that cuts it hundreds of billions more. The — the secretary of defense has said that these cuts would be devastating.
Let — let me tell you, I know the president is — is — is pleased to see us reduce our military spending. I am not pleased to see that. I want to make sure that we continue to spend for a military that's second to none in the world. I will restore — [cheers and applause] — our military budget and not cut our military commitment.
Now — now, there's one more issue where there's a big difference, and that is — well, there are a lot of issues, but one more I'm going to talk about right now, and that is with regards to jobs. The president keeps being asked what he's going to do to try and get the economy going and to create a real recovery. And — [chuckles] — I hear "nothing" back there. [laughter] Actually, he wants to do the same thing he's been doing, which is he wants a stimulus and hire more government workers. There's nothing wrong with government workers, but that's not going to get the private sector working again.
He wants to invest, he says, you know, and — as — as some people say, he wants to pick winners and losers. I think he just wants to pick losers, from what I can tell. [laughter] And, of course, he wants to raise taxes. I don't think there's anyone out there who thinks that you create more jobs by raising taxes on people.
So that's his plan. It's a status quo plan. And I know where it leads. It leads to high unemployment, no wage growth and of course to fiscal calamity down the road for our nation.
My plan, as Paul Ryan described last, has five major parts. Number one, we're going to take full advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. [cheers and applause]
Number two, we're going to make trade work for us. We're going to open up new markets for our goods around the world, but we're going to crack down on China when they cheat, and they have. We're getting those jobs back here. [cheers and applause]
Number three, we're going to have training programs that work for us. Right now, there are 47 — 47 different federal job training reporting to eight different agencies. The overhead has to be extraordinary. I want to take those dollars and make sure they come back to each state. Virginia gets its fair share, and the people in Virginia create their own training programs that work for the people here in Virginia. [cheers and applause]
Number four, I want to make sure that people who are thinking of investing in America and building a new facility and hiring people or entrepreneurs thinking about taking their life savings and starting a business, that they're willing to do so because they know we're not on the road to Greece. And what we're doing right now with this massive spending, far more than we take in, frightens people from investing in the future of America. I will do this: I will cut federal spending, I will cap federal spending, and I'll get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
And number five — number five, I'm going to champion small business. We're going to help small businesses like this one — [cheers and applause] — and others around this country. That's where jobs come from. We're going to get people working again by holding down taxes on small business, by getting regulators to help small businesses and, by the way, to take that big cloud off of small business.
Seventy-five percent of small businesses surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce said that because of "Obamacare," they're less likely to hire people. That's one reason we're going to repeal it and replace it with real reform. [cheers and applause]
Now I'm confident that America, America is going to overcome the challenges we have. I know we face real challenges at home with so many people out of work and with schools that are not performing as they should with — with deficits and people spending massive more — our government, rather, spending massively more than we take in every year.
We've got real challenges. Got challenges around the world as Iran keeps getting closer and closier — closer to — to its — to a nuclear status.
And with all those challenges, some people get a little discouraged. I'm actually — I'm optimistic. I've seen the American people facing tough times. We're a people that lives for something bigger than ourselves.
I — I was at the Republican convention not terribly long ago when I met Jane Horton there. Jane's husband, a sharpshooter in Afghanistan, on the day she was packing a — a package to go over him for his birthday, she got a knock at the door and was told that he had been killed there. And instead of falling into despair and depression, she went to work to try and help other families who had lost loved ones in these conflicts.
And on the day of the funeral, her husband's service, some of these misguided souls that were protesting America's military came to the service where her husband was going to be interred. And she was asked what she thought about those people protesting at his funeral. And she said this, she said, Chris died for them to be able to protest. This says something about the character of the American heart and our great people. [cheers and applause]
I learned something about this throughout my life, about the great qualities of the human spirit that you see demonstrated in the American heart. I had the chance some years ago — I was working with the Boy Scouts, and we had a Court of Honor. Some of you know what that is. It's where the young men get their Eagle Scouts and — [cheers] — we've got some scouters here — and other awards. There was a long formica table and I was seated at the end of it next to the American flag.
And the flag — the flag — excuse me — the guy who was giving the speech was a guy who was a scout master from Monument, Colorado. And he took to the podium and he said that his Boy Scout troop wanted to have an American flag that was really special. So they bought one with gold tassels around it, they had it flown above the state capitol, as I recall, they sent it to Washington, where it was flown above the U.S. Capitol, and then they contacted NASA and said, we'd like our flag to go up on the space shuttle.
I imagine space is at a premium in space, you know — [laughter] — so they're not given to taking souvenirs for every Boy Scout troop, but the took this flag, put it on the space shuttle. He said the boys were so proud, as they were seated in their classrooms at school watching the shuttle launch — shuttle launch, knowing their flag was onboard, and then they saw the launch explode. They saw the shuttle explode in the air there.
And he said that he — he contacted NASA about a couple of weeks after the disaster and said, have you found any remnant of our flag? They said no. He said he called about once a week for months, asking, have you found anything? They hadn't found anything.
And then he said he was reading an article — I think it was a little over half a year later, in September, reading about the debris that was associated with the Challenger disaster and what had been found, and in that description it mentioned something about a flag.
So he called NASA again, said, did you find our flag? They said, well, yes, come — come, we'll make a presentation to you.
So NASA and this troop came together, and he said they were presented with a plastic container. And they opened the container, and there was their flag in perfect conditions.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Oooh! [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: And he said, that's it on the flagpole next to Mr. Romney at the end of the table. And — [chuckles] — I reached over, and I — I grabbed that flag and held it out, and it was as if electricity was running through my arm. As — as I thought about the men and women in our space program who've put themselves in harm's way for discovery, for innovation, for pioneering, for us, living for something bigger than themselves. I — I think of the single moms who — who work hard to raise their children and give them dignity and — and — and devote themselves to their children. I think of the — of the dad who's got two jobs to make sure that he can buy the kind of clothing his kid needs so he won't stand out in school.
I think of the — of the kid coming out of high school who says, you know what, instead of going on to college, I'm going to — I'm going to enlist in the military, and I want to serve our country. I love those who serve. I appreciate the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. I can't understand the president, who's commander in chief, cutting our commitment to our military. This is a time for us to have a strong military, not to weaken it. America's military must be so strong no one would ever think of testing it. [cheers and applause]
I love those — I love those words in one of our national hymns: O beautiful, for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Would our veterans and members of the armed services please raise your hands?
Wow! [cheers and applause] Look at that group.
We're a nation of people who give ourselves to something bigger than ourselves — our family, our community, our faith, our country. It's what makes America America, what gives us the vitality to overcome the challenges we have.
And now we face those challenges. We stand on the shoulders of the "Greatest Generation." They brought us a nation that's prosperous and free, and they held a torch aloft for the whole world to see, a torch of freedom and opportunity and hope. They held it high.
It's not America's duty to hold up that torch, it's America's honor to hold that torch. But now there are not as — [cheers] — there are not as many of them as there used to be, and they're not — not able to hold it as high as they used to be able to, and so it's our turn. We've got to hold on to that torch and lift it for the world. [cheers and applause]
And I commit to you this: If I — when I become president of the United States — [cheers and applause] — I will do — I will do everything in my power to strengthen America. I'll do everything in my power to strengthen our values and our homes, to strengthen our economy, to make sure our economy can fund a military second to none.
This is critical time for America. We must let the light of that torch burn bright in our homes, in our communities, in our businesses, throughout the world, as our men and women serve.
I love this country. I believe in America. This country's coming back. [cheers and applause] Thanks to you, we're going to win in November. Virginia's going to get me the White House, and we're taking back America.
Thank you so much. [cheers and applause] Great to be with you! Thank you!

Remarks in Portsmouth, Ohio

October 13, 2012

MITT ROMNEY: Wow! Thank you so much. [cheers and applause] What a Portsmouth welcome. Thank you!
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. What a — what a beautiful day. What a wonderful opportunity to be at Shawnee State. Thank you for that great welcome. Thank you, Senator Portman. I'm — I'm delighted as well that we're going to see a new congressman. Where is Dr. Brad — Dr. Brad Wenstrup? Is he hanging around here just —
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He's right over there.
MR. ROMNEY: He's right over here. Thank you, Doctor. Where'd he go? [cheers and applause] We're going to get you elected.
Appreciate the chance to be with you today and spend some time and talk about the course ahead for our great nation. We face some extraordinary challenges, as you know. And you've gathered today not just to listen to a couple of people speak, but to think about the future of the country that you love, and ask yourself how it is that America's going to be able to face up to the challenges we have. I can tell you, I'm a hundred percent confident that we're going to. [cheers and applause] I know the American heart. I've seen the people of this country. I believe in you and I believe in America. [cheers and applause]
Now, as the senator said, this has been an interesting 10 days or so. I had a debate about a week ago. I enjoyed that a great deal. I've got to be honest — [cheers and applause]. I got to ask the president some questions people across the country have been wanting to ask him, like — like why it was with 23 million Americans out of work, struggling to find a good job, that he spent his first two years fighting for "Obamacare," which made it harder to get jobs. I got to ask him why it was with gasoline prices twice as high as when he took office, he cut in half the number of permits and licenses on federal lands and in federal waters for drilling for oil and gas; why it was that with a deficit of a trillion dollars, record-breaking deficit, that he spent $90 billion sending money to green energy companies, some of whom had contributors that had given to his campaign.
I got to — I got to ask him why it was that he had promised that health insurance premiums would go down by $2,000 per family, and yet they've gone up by $2,000 per family.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: And the only answer he had a few weeks ago was this: He said, you know, you can't change Washington from the inside; you can only change it from the outside. We're going to give him that chance on November 6th. [cheers and applause]
And — and I've got more questions now, of course. We may get a chance to ask these as well: why it is with 47 million people on food stamps — you think about that. When he took office, there were 32 million people on food stamps. He's now added 15 million more, all right — more than the population of Ohio. The income of the median family in America has gone down by $4,300 per family. In times like this, what is he talking about? Saving Big Bird. [laughter] When I'm president, I'm going to help save the American family and get good jobs for every American. [cheers and applause] As I look around Portsmouth today, let me tell you, his campaign is about smaller and smaller things, and our campaign is about bigger and bigger crowds fighting for a bright future. [cheers and applause]
Now. there's one part of our debate where we agreed. The president and I agreed that there's a very dramatic difference between the courses we would take for this country to help the middle class of America with more jobs and more take-home pay. His plan is quite different. If he were re-elected, there's no question in my mind but you're going to see higher taxes. The vice president blurted out the truth the other day. He said taxes are going up by a trillion dollars. He's going to raise taxes on the middle class, he's going to raise taxes on small business. I make this commitment: I will not raise taxes on the middle class of America or on small business. [cheers and applause]
If he were re-elected, he would install "Obamacare." (Jeers.) And "Obamacare" will cost the average American family an extra $2,500 a year in premiums. If I get elected, we're going to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with real reforms which help pull down the cost of health care. [cheers and applause] You know, if he gets re-elected, he's made it clear he's cutting $716 billion from Medicare. I see a few seniors over here; they're — they're — they're shaking their heads here. If I'm — if I'm elected president of the United States, I will restore that $716 billion to Medicare and honor the promises that we've made to our seniors. [cheers and applause]
One of the things I think a number of us find most — find most disturbing about the president's plans is that he anticipates that his budget, cutting our military by hundreds of billions of dollars — (boos, jeers) — and then, through the sequestration plan, an additional hundreds of billions of dollars — about a trillion dollars in total. The Secretary of Defense has said these cuts would be devastating, not just to the families that work in the defense world but also to our national security. He will cut our military capability. I will restore it and make sure America's military remains forever second to none. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
MR. ROMNEY: And then, of course, it comes down to the economy and jobs. The president is asked time and again, how are you going to get this economy going? With these 23 million people that are struggling to find a good job, how are you going to help them? And he says the same things he's been saying for four years. What he says is, well, we're going to have a stimulus, and we're going hire more government workers — nothing wrong with government workers, but that's not going to get this economy going. And then — then of course he — he says he's going to invest. He likes to pick winners and losers, like Solyndra — as my friend said, he likes to pick losers. (Murmurs of assent.) And then, of course, he — he says he's going to raise taxes. Does anyone really think raising taxes on anyone helps get more people to work? (Chorus of noes.) The president's plan is status quo, more of the same. He calls it forward; I call it forewarned.
[laughter] We know where it leads. We've seen where it leads. We don't like where it lead — needs. We want to have a real recovery, and I'm going to help bring it. [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Love you! [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: There are five things — there are five things I know we can do to get this economy going. Some will have an immediate impact. Number one, we're going to take full advantage of our oil, our coal, our natural gas — [cheers and applause] — our nuclear, our renewables. [cheers and applause] We got 250 years of coal. It can be burned cleanly. This president, when he was running for office, said that if you want to build a new coal plant, you can, but that if you do, you'll go bankrupt. That tells something about his philosophy. Mine is this: We have a lot of coal; we're going to use it. We're going to keep those jobs, and we're going to keep America energy-secure. [cheers and applause]
Drilling for oil and gas — I want to make sure we take advantage of the oil and gas we have on our lands and offshore. I want to make sure we drill up in Alaska. And I want to make sure we bring that pipeline in from Canada. [cheers and applause] And I know — I know you're particularly aware of nuclear as well and recognize that America must have a reliable source of domestically produced uranium — enriched uranium. [cheers] And we need to make sure that Piketon has the most modern technology so that we can provide that source of security for our great country. [cheers and applause] Number one, energy.
Number two, we're going to make trade work for America. Look, it's good for us to open up markets that we can send our goods into. The Chinese and the Europeans have been doing this over the last four years during this president's term. They've negotiated some 44 different trade arrangements with countries around the world. What's this president negotiated? What's he signed in the last four years? Not a one. Not a one. I want to open up new markets, particularly in Latin America, to get our people to work.
But number two, I want to make sure that when people cheat, when they don't follow the rules in trade, we finally hold them accountable. It's time for us to stand up to China for their cheating; it's got to stop. [cheers and applause] You know, the — the president — the president has an opportunity — had an opportunity — was required as of last Friday to officially designate whether China is a currency manipulator. Let me tell you what that means, by the way. When — when a country artificially holds down the value of their currency, it means that the products that they sell to us are artificially cheap. And that means that American companies that are making these — [inaudible] — products — they go out of business if their Chinese products are so much cheaper than the real costs behind them.
And yet over the past several years, the president's failed to call China a currency manipulator. He had the occasion on Friday to come out with that official designation. Do you know what they said? We're not going to make any determination until after the election. (Laughter, boos.) Let me tell you, on day one of my administration, I will label China a currency manipulator. We got to get those jobs back and get trade to be fair. [cheers and applause]
Number three, we're going to make sure our people have good skills so they can compete for the jobs of today with training programs that work, particularly by taking the federal dollars, bringing them back to the states so the states can craft programs that work for their own workers and the jobs that are available in their own communities. [cheers and applause] And we got to fix our schools if people are going to have the right skills. This is a great, great university; I appreciate the work being done here. But boy, our K-12 schools are really struggling in many parts of this country. It's unacceptable that our kids are being educated in a way that's not competitive with other nations. When I become president, I'm going to make sure we put our kids and their parents and the teachers first, and the teachers' union is going to have to go behind. [cheers and applause]
Number four — number four — so number one was energy. Number two was trade that works for America. Number three is making sure we have the skills to succeed. But number four — if you're going to get a small business opened up with a person risking their life savings to start a business, or a big business to come to your community and open up stores and hire people, they're going to have to be convinced we're not on the road to Greece. And if we keep spending a trillion dollars more than we take in every year, we're on the road to Greece. I think it is immoral for us to keep spending more than we take in. I think it's bad economics. [cheers and applause] It kills jobs. When I become president, we're going to cut federal spending, we're going to cap federal spending, and we're finally going to get on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
And number five, number five, we're going to champion small business. We're going to make it easier for small businesses to grow and thrive. We're going to keep their taxes down, get regulators to help them and get rid of "Obamacare," because it's killing business — jobs for small business. [cheers and applause]
You — you do those five things, you make those five things happen — as I will do, with Paul Ryan's help — we'll get those five things to happen, you do those things, we create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. We need those jobs. We need that pay. America's coming back. [cheers and applause]
And I'm confident —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [chanting] Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney!
MR. ROMNEY: — I'm confident (in the ?) future. Let me tell you, I'm confident about what's going to happen. I've had the chance to — all my life to see the great qualities of the human spirit demonstrated in my fellow Americans, time and time again. I'm inspired by the people I see, and know that with a president that's able to lead and draw on the unity of the American spirit and call on American greatness, we'll overcome the challenges we have. There's some big ones: our national debt, the deficits, the fact that we have so many people out of work, take-home pay going down; around the world, tumult in the Middle East. We've faced some extraordinary challenges. But we're going to overcome them.
Let me tell you a couple of examples and tell me (sic) why I know that's the case. One was at the Republican convention, I met someone named Jane Horton. Jane, her husband, Christopher, a sharpshooter in Afghanistan, she's packing a package for him for his birthday. And on the day she's packing that package, a knock comes at the door and she's informed that her husband has been killed in Afghanistan. And instead of falling into despair and despondency, she devotes her life to helping the families of other who've lost their loved ones.
And on the day of the funeral of her husband, there was a demonstration. Do you remember this? There was some misguided people that came to the funerals of our service men and and women to demonstrate? Well, they came to the funeral of her husband. And she was asked, what do you think about this? What do you think about these people?
And this is what she said. Chris died for them to be able to protest. That's the character of great Americans, to recognize our values and to salute them. [cheers and applause] We stand for freedom.
Some years ago, I was at a Boy Scout court of honor. Any Boy Scouts here?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: Good, good. I'd ask the Eagles to raise their hand, but I'm not — I'll do that later. [laughter] At a Boy Scout court of honor, you get your Eagle award, but you also get other awards if you haven't reached your Eagle yet. And I was at the front of the room, at the end of these one long Formica tables. And there was a flagpole there. And I sat down, and the person who was at the podium speaking was the scoutmaster from Monument, Colorado. And he talked about the fact that his Boy Scout troop wanted to have a very special flag. And so they got this flag, they bought it; it had gold tassels around it. They had it flown above the State Capitol, as I recall, and sent it to Washington, D.C., to have it flown above the United States Capitol. And then when it came back, the boys said, you know, wouldn't it be cool if we could send it up on the space shuttle. So they contacted NASA. So would you take our flag on the space shuttle? I'm sure that space is at a premium in space — [laughter] — but NASA said, OK, we'll take your flag. So on the shuttle it went.
And he said, the boys were so proud sitting in school, in their homerooms watching the shuttle launch on TV until they saw the shuttle explode on the TV screen. This was the Challenger disaster. And he said he called NASA about two weeks later and asked, have you got any remnant of our flag? And they didn't. He said he kept calling, week after week after week, finally gave up calling. Sometime, I think late in the year, September or so, he was reading an article about all of the debris from the Challenger disaster, there's some mention of a — of a flag. And so he called NASA and said, did you find some part of our flag? And they said, yes, we'll make a presentation. Let's get together. So NASA and the Boy Scouts came together and NASA presented the scouts with this little plastic case. And they opened the case, and he said, there was our flag in perfect condition.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Wow!
MR. ROMNEY: And then he said, and that's it on the flagpole next to Mr. Romney at the end of the table. And I reached over and grabbed the flag and held it out. And as I did, it was as if electricity was running through my arm, because I thought of all the people who sacrificed in America for learning, for freedom, for our safety and security.
I thought about those — those heroes on that flight.
I think about all of those who give so greatly for America. We're a nation with individuals who live for something bigger than ourselves, whether it's — whether it's the dad that's got two jobs to make sure that he can buy clothes for his kids so the kids don't stand out at school; whether it's the single mom who wonders how she can put food on the table at the end of the week and so scrimps and — and saves to be able to provide for those kids; whether it's the person who comes out of a great university like this and puts aside their career and says, I'm going to go into the military because my country needs me right now; whether it's the parents who at Christmas time say, you know, let's not give gifts to each other; let's make sure we can save enough to have a great Christmas for our kids. We as Americans live for something bigger than ourself (sic).
I love — I love our servicemen and -women. [cheers and applause] I love the — the sacrifice they make for this country. I see some folks sitting over here who served our country. [cheers and applause] Thank you for your service. Would all those who are members of the armed forces or veterans please raise your hands and please be recognized? Thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you.
I love that — I love that verse from one of our national hymns: "Oh, beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved, and mercy more than life." I love the fact that in America we live for grand things, for big things. We understand challenges; we rise to the challenge. Now's our time. I happened to be in San Diego on Memorial Day. A group of veterans like these that were seated not far from me — one of them had been the lookout on the U.S.S. Tennessee on the day of Pearl Harbor. He said that his eyes locked on the eyes of the pilot bringing in the bombs that would attack their ships. He was injured in the blast and went on to serve for 33 years in the U.S. Navy, a hero.
I think about this greatest generation, what they earned for us: a safe America, a prosperous America. They held aloft a torch for the whole world to see, a torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. There are not as many of them as there used to be, and they're not as strong because they're getting a little older. It's our turn. We've got to grab that torch. We've got to hold it aloft. [cheers and applause] We've got to make sure that America's strong. [cheers and applause] And I commit to you, when I'm president of the United States — when I am president of the United States — [cheers and applause] — I will keep America strong in our homes, in our economy, in our military. We'll make sure our military's so strong, no one would ever think of testing America. This is a time for us to come back. We're going to take back this country. I need your help. Get out and vote. We need to make sure that we elect people like Josh Mandel. We need to make sure we take back America and keep this land the hope of the earth. I'm counting on you, Portsmouth. Let's make it happen.
Thank you so much. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you.

Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Leesburg, Virginia

October 17, 2012

[cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Wow! Thank you so much. There's a north Virginia welcome. Thank you, Virginia. (Sustained cheers and applause.) Thank you. Wow, what a thrill.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you so much. Boy, you guys. You know, we're going to win Virginia, you know that? We're going to win. [cheers and applause]
I — I want to thank you most for being here this evening and for welcoming me and sending such a clear message across the country and across Virginia. I want to say thanks also to Andy Griggs for coming here and entertaining you. Generous of him to do that. [applause] And thank you to Dennis Miller. What a great guy. [cheers and applause] And appreciate him coming out here and speaking the truth.
And Congressman Wolf, I think that's the first time he's ever been introduced as Frank Whatever-your-name-is. [laughter] That was really — thank you, Congressman, for doing that. And — and also, I was with your governor today, Bob McDonnell. He's a great friend. He's now — [cheers and applause] — out campaigning. I appreciate all he does. You're lucky to have a man like that.
I — I love these debates we've been having, you know that? Those have been a lot of fun. [cheers and applause] I — I think it's interesting. With — with two presidential debates gone, the president still hasn't found an agenda for a second term. We have an agenda for our term, and our agenda's going to get this country working again. [cheers and applause]
Now we have one weekend left before our final debate, and I hope he's able to come up with an agenda over the weekend so — [laughter] — in that last debate, he's able to describe what he'd do if he got four more years. But that's not likely to happen, so he doesn't need to worry about it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Actually, he — he seems to spend most of his time in these debates talking about why my plans aren't going to work. I — I wish he'd spend a little more time explaining why his plans have not worked, and — [cheers and applause] — I mean, you heard — you heard the questions last night. Jeremy was the first person with a question, and he — he said, you know, I — I'm coming out of college. How can I be sure I'm going to have a job? And the president wasn't able to answer how he'd make sure he'd have a job.
Fifty percent of college kids graduating last year couldn't find work or college-level work. I've got an answer for Jeremy. When I become president, I'm going to make sure our kids can find good jobs when they come out of college. [cheers and applause]
Lorraine asked a question about immigration. She wanted to know what th future was of legal immigration in this country. And — and again, the president — you know, we had a question for him. I said, Mr. President, will you explain to us why it was that having — during your campaign said your highest priority would be to file a bill in your first year — first year, when there was a Democrat House and Democrat Senate — you would file a bill to reform our immigration system, and you did not do that. You didn't promise you'd get it passed, you just said you'd file it, and you did not even do that. He had no answer for that either.
He wasn't able to explain another thing, and that was the question that came from Michael. Michael said, you know, why should I vote for you because things aren't going so well. And he wasn't able to explain why the middle class has been so buried over these last four years. And — and I — actually, I was able to describe how tough things have been and how much better they're going to be.
And then there was another question that came from Katherine about women working in the work — in the workplace. And he — he wasn't able to describe exactly the kinds of questions and answers that I think she had in her mind — answers to those things. For instance, why it is that today, 3.6 million more women are living in poverty than when President Obama took office.
And let me mention one more question he couldn't answer. [boos] And that was the question that came from Philip. Philip was the one that asked about gasoline prices. You recall they've gone from about $1.86 to $4 a gallon. [boos] And the president said that's because the economy got better. [laughter] And I thought to myself when we have a real recovery, is he saying they're going to go to $6 or $7?
Look — [laughter] — the president's policies are running on fumes. It's time to finally get a president that'll get this country working again. [cheers and applause]
Now, we — [applause] — I — I think — I think, for all the to and fro in the debates — and I know they're very interesting, and I enjoy the experience — but my guess is that when the debates are over and people stop and they think, OK, what's America going to be like if President Obama is re-elected and what's America going to be like if we get a new president? And there's some pretty stark differences.
If the president were to get re-elected, you will see, at the end of a — four years, a second term, you would see America almost $20 trillion of debt. We'd crush the American dream for the coming generation. [boos] When I become president — when I become president — [cheers and applause] — we're finally — we're finally going to cut spending, we're going to cap federal spending and we're going to get America on track to a balanced budget because that's the only moral course a great nation can take. [cheers and applause]
If we got four more years like the last four years, you're going to see taxes go up. The vice president blurted out the truth the other day; he said, yeah, we're going to raise taxes by a trillion dollars. But that's just the beginning, because with all their spending and borrowing the interest costs go up and up and they're going to have to raise more than just taxes on the very high income folks. The calculation is they'll raise taxes $4,000 per middle income family. When I become president, I will not raise taxes on middle income. I'll bring them down, and also bring them down for small business. [cheers and applause]
You — you heard — you heard in the first debate — you heard at our first debate, the president's plan is to cut Medicaid — excuse me, Medicare — that's the program for seniors, the health care program for seniors — he's going to cut spending in that by $716 billion. That's for current retirees. I will not cut the program for current retirees; I'll put that money back and honor the promises that we've made to our seniors in this country. [cheers and applause]
There's one place — there's one place, though, he seems to be willing to cut spending. And that's for our military. [boos] I — I don't think the world is a safe place.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No —
MR. ROMNEY: I look around the world, with North Korea with its nuclear capability and a very strange dictator. I look at what's happening throughout the Middle East and Pakistan, and I look around North Africa now, with North Mali having been taken by an al-Qaida affiliate. And I recognize the world continues to be dangerous. And the decisions we make now about our military will determine our ability to defend ourselves in the future.
We — it's hard to know what the future might hold. In the 2000 debate, when we were having an election to determine who our president would be — back in the year 2000, there was no mention of terrorism because we didn't know that was on our doorstep. And it came only a year later. We — we don't know what kind of threats we're going to face down the road, but this I can tell you: Unlike cutting the military, as this president would do by a trillion dollars, I will instead maintain our military strength because America's military must be second to none and so strong no one would ever test us. [cheers and applause]
And that of course —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: How come — how come all these guys back there got the thundersticks; that's the question, right? (Laughter, cheers, applause.) Look at that. Don't encourage them. Don't encourage them, now. [laughter]
The president was asked a number of times about how he's going to get the economy going over the past couple of debates, and he just doesn't have an answer for that other than to say more of the same. He says we're going to go forward. I think "forewarned" is a better word. [laughter] We've seen the results of the last four years. He had a stimulus, and he wants to hire more government workers — nothing wrong with government workers, but that's not going to get the private economy going. He wants to raise taxes; no one thinks raising taxes will add jobs. And then, of course, he wants to pick winners and losers. And of course, in his case, mostly losers. [laughter]
And we — we've long learned that government picking winners and losers is not the right way to go. My — my own view to get the economy going is pretty straightforward.
One is to take advantage of this extraordinary ace in the hole we have. By virtue of new technology — when I say new technology, we've always been able to drill in the earth vertically, but someone learned how to go vertically and then horizontally and to tap into various pockets of oil and gas. And because of that, massive new resources of both oil and gas in this country. That's why we actually can become North American energy independent within eight years, because of this new technology. [cheers and applause]
And I'm — I'm going to take advantage of it, get us on that track. And by the way, as we do that, and as we bring in that pipeline from Canada — it was interesting — [cheers and applause] — I — I just have to mention. I remember last night, the president also saying about energy. He said, you know, we — we built pipelines that would go around the earth, and I thought, you know, it — it's just the one that comes from Canada with the oil is the one we want, you think? [laughter] And so that's the one I'm going to get. [applause]
And — so energy. And that'll create a lot of jobs not just in the energy sector, but in manufacturing and other parts of America, places that use a lot of energy. They'll come back here to create jobs. That's one.
Number two, I like trade, I like opening up new markets for American goods so we can sell things abroad, and particularly in Latin America. In our — and — did you realize Latin America's economy is about the same size as China's, growing fast with great opportunity for us next door in the same time zones? We want to take advantage of those — of those opportunities nearby. So we're going to take advantage of — of trade.
And then number three, we're going to make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed with — with training programs that work for people to give them the skills they need and — and to make sure our schools are the best in the world.
Look, how can the nation that invented public education fall so far behind? I'm going to make sure we put our kids first, parents first, teachers first and the teachers union is going to go behind. [cheers and applause]
And, of course, balancing a budget is essential to create a strong economy.
And one more, number five. I'm going to champion small business. [cheers and applause] I've gone across the country and I — I — I've seen the — the power and the vitality of small business. And when I talk to people who've been able to grow a small business, they tell me time and again we're overtaxed, we're overregulated, we're getting burdened by the threat of "Obamacare" down — coming down the road. I want to make it easier for small busines to grow and thrive. I know how to do that.
I've been — I've spent 25 years in business. I want to make it easier for small business. I — I was with a guy who — who had an electronics business, four employees in St. Louis. And he said that he and his son calculated how much money they spend in taxes every year. You see, he's one of the lucky small businesspeople who actually succeeded.
I mean, it's hard to get a business going. Most of them don't make it; his made it. So he pays taxes. He said, we calculated our federal income tax, our federal payroll tax, our state income tax, our real estate tax, our gasoline tax, we added them together and it was over half of what we make. And so when you — when you're in a country where, if you're successful, the government takes over half of what you're making, you make it less likely for businesses to grow and thrive.
I want to get those tax rates down so small business can grow and hire more people. [cheers and applause] And by the way — and by the way, that — that small businessman I'm talking about, he did build that business, all right. He and the people there — [cheers and applause] — they built that business.
I just love — there's so much about this country I love. I — I — I've seen people — some of these small businesses, the entrepreneurship and innovation in their hearts just inspire me.
I was with a woman who has her own business, and I said how'd you get — how'd you get going? She said, well, my husband lost his job and he took a class in upholstering. And she, being the better business mind in the family, formed a corporation and hired him as her first employee. [laughter] And — and she went on, she said, to hire 39 more people as upholsterers. And she now has a leading upholstering company. And I thought, well, that's creative and innovative.
And then I met another guy, Jim Leotoad from Central Illinois. Jim graduated from high school second in his class — second from the bottom, that is. [laughter] And Jim — Jim concluded that college was not likely to be part of his future, so he — he had decided he was going to start a food business. And — and he talked to his dad, and his dad agreed to loan him some money, they'd split the business about 50-50.
And so Jim went out to get one of those griddles that you put — or, you cook hamburgers on; those rollers that you cook hot dogs on. And when he priced it all out, it was a lot more money than he had. He concluded all he could do in the food industry with the money he had was make sandwiches, because sandwiches don't take any particular equipment — just some stainless steel tables and so forth. So he bought those, and went into a garage and began making sandwiches and delivering them people — and delivering them to people at work.
Now, Jimmy John's has 1,500 restaurants — [cheers and applause] — and 60,000 employees. Sixty thousand! It's an amazing country. And — and what I want to do, I don't want to transform America into something we wouldn't recognize. I don't make America like Europe; I don't like — want to make America a government-centered society. [boos] I want to restore to America the freedoms that drive our economy. Our economy is driven by freedom, by personal freedom, by people pursing their dreams. [cheers and applause] I want to bring that back.
And the nation —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: The nation is also — it's also driven by patriotism, by some of the great qualities of the human spirit that we see evidenced in our fellow Americans from day to day. Throughout my life, I've been inspired by the people of this country, some in very remarkable ways.
I remember, I was a Boy Scout leader in Massachusetts, and — got a few Scouters here, I hear — [cheers and applause] — and I was at a Court of Honor. And there was a Formica table in front, in the gymnasium, and I was seated at the far end of the Formica table, next to the American flag. And the person who was speaking at the podium was the scoutmaster for Monument, Colorado.
And he told a story about their flag. Their Boy Scout troop had decided to have a very special American flag. And they bought one with gold tassels around it, and then they had it flown in unusual places, including above the Capitol dome. And then when it came home, the boys said, look, we'd — we'd like to have it also go up on the space shuttle. And so they contacted NASA and said, would you take our flag on the space shuttle?
Now, space is at a premium in space — [laughter] — and they're not, you know, likely to take souvenirs from everybody across America, but they agreed. They said, yeah, we'll take that flag for your Boy Scout troop. And so it went on the space shuttle. He said — you can imagine how proud the boys were, looking from their homerooms at school, watching the TV set as they watched the shuttle launch with great pride. And then they saw it exploded on the TV screen, before their eyes.
And the scoutmaster said that he called NASA a couple of weeks later and said, have you found any remnant of our flag? And they said no.
He said that he called month after month, almost every week, asking them had they found some remnant of the flag, and the answer was always no. And then he finally gave up calling until about September, when he was reading an article in the newspaper that described some of the debris that had been found from Challenger disaster. And they mentioned something about a flag there. So he called NASA, and they said, in fact, we do have a presentation to make to you and your troop.
And so NASA came together with the Boy Scout troop and their parents, and they were presented with a plastic container. And the boys open it up, and there inside was their flag in perfect condition. [applause] And he said, and that's it on the flagpole, next to Mr. Romney.
And I — [chuckles] — I reached over and I grabbed the flag and pulled it out. And it was as if electricity was running through my arm, as I thought about the sacrifice of our men and women in the space program — their love for learning, their willingness to pioneer for us, the discoveries they made that our life might be more enjoyable and full.
It's the nature of America, to live for something bigger than ourselves. It's the young man or the young woman who graduates from high school or college and says, I'm going to put my career on the side for now; I want to go serve my nation. It's the — [cheers and applause] — it's the single mom — it's the single mom who doesn't know whether they'll be able to put food on the table at the end of the week, and scrimps and saves so they can do so. (Helicopter sounds overhead.) And it's the sound of freedom, like a helicopter going by. [laughter] That's probably another military helicopter, but I appreciate it when I hear them. [cheers and applause] Smile, you guys, we're on TV. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) I'm just kidding; I have no idea whose helicopter that is. [laughter]
There are other sacrifices we make. I see dads who are working two jobs now, and they're working two jobs so they can buy clothes for their kids so the kid doesn't stand out in school. And there are parents this Christmas who aren't going to exchange gifts with one another. They're instead going to make sure their kids have a great Christmas.
This is the nature of our American spirit. We live for something bigger than ourselves. I love in particular the men and women of our military. I love the fact that they sacrifice day in and day out for our — for our safety and for our well-being. [cheers and applause]
I love that — I love that verse in O — "America the Beautiful." "O beautiful, for heroes proved, in liberating strife, who more than self their country love and mercy more than life." Would our veterans please raise your hands and members of the armed forces to be recognized? [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you.
I want to draw — I want to draw on that spirit. I want to draw on the spirit of unity in this country. I don't want to divide America, I want to bring America together. I want to — to kindle once again the great qualities of the human spirit that exist within America. I want to make sure that we come together as Republicans and Democrats. People of all the states come together, get this country right again.
I don't want to transform America, I want to restore the values that make America the nation that we are. I want to get our economy going, put people back to work. [cheers and applause]
Twenty days. We have 20 days, we have 20 days. We need to take back America. It's up to you guys in Virginia. [cheers and applause] You can make the difference. You're going to make the difference. We're taking back America. We're going to remain the powerhouse of the earth, putting our people back to work, giving our kids a bright future.
America's coming back. We're going to have a real recovery. Thank you, guys. [cheers and applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Chesapeake, Virginia

October 17, 2012

[cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you. What a great Virginia welcome. Thank you so much for your warm welcome. What a — I know you've been standing for a while, but there have been some extraordinary people speaking to you.
Wasn't that fun listening to Lee Greenwood? Isn't he — isn't he something else? [cheers and applause] Boy, that was a — that was touching, and I appreciate the attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, speaking to you, and also Congressman Forbes. These are — these are great people and deserve your support and work.
And I wish that George Allen were here today, but we are going to elect him the next senator for the state of Virginia. [cheers and applause]
And Governor McDonnell, he's been everywhere campaigning for me, all over the country. And I — and I appreciate it. I know he's got real support all over this nation. People recognize, as the head of the Republican Governors Association, that he has a real interest in seeing conservative principles like he's applying here apply to other states, and I appreciate him coming here and spending some time with me and welcoming me as he just did. And — [applause] — yeah, quite a guy.
And then — and Dennis Miller. Gosh, this guy — [cheers and applause] — he's — he's got talent, he's got humor and he's got the right candidate this time. So I appreciate that. [cheers and applause]
Now, I have to be honest with you. I love these debates. You know, these things are great — [cheers and applause] — and I think it's interesting that the president still doesn't have an agenda for a second term. Don't you think that it's time for him to — to finally put together a vision of what he'd do in the next four years if he were elected?
I mean, he's got to — he's got to come up with that over this weekend because there's only one debate left on Monday. (Cheers, laughter.) And I — I just think the American people had expected that the president of the United States would be able to describe what he's going to do in the next four years, but he can't.
He can't even explain what he's done in the last four years. [laughter]
I mean, he's spent most of his time trying to talk about how my plan won't work. Well, what about his plan? [cheers] We know his plan has not worked. And last night there were a lot of people asking questions, and I — I think they deserve some answers on a number of fronts.
I — I think — I think it was Jeremy who — who asked a question about how am I going to get a job when I get out of college? Half of the kids in this country not able to get work or college-level work that are coming out of college? I mean, that's a question that needs to be answered.
And then you heard Lorraine saying, when you promised, Mr. President, to put in place an immigration reform bill in your first term — oh, I guess it was me that asked this question, but it was her idea. [laughter] She brought up immigration. You promised to put out in your first term, your highest priority, you'd put out a bill in your first year, but you didn't even file bills. She deserves an answer.
And then we heard from Michael, and — and he asked a question: Why — why should we vote for you, because the middle class is just getting — is getting buried? And I described all the ways in which the president had failed to help lift the middle class. This is an election about the great middle class of America. It's helping people that are poor get into the middle class, helping people in the middle class have a brighter future, and he had no answer as to why he had failed to help the middle class and why they're having such tough times.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (He lost ?)!
MR. ROMNEY: Katherine — Katherine spoke about — about women and women's equality in the workforce, and I asked the question that — that she deserves an answer to, which is why is it that there are 3.6 million more women in poverty today than when the president took office? This president has failed America's women. They've suffered in terms of getting jobs, they've suffered in terms of falling into poverty. This is a presidency that has not helped America's women. And as I go across the country and ask women, what can I do to help, what they speak about, day in and day out, is help me find a good job or a good job for my spouse, and help my kid — make sure my children have a bright future, better schools and better job opportunities.
That's what the women of America are concerned about, and the answers are coming from us and not from Barack Obama. [cheers and applause]
And let me mention — I just want to mentioned Philip . Philip was the first questioner of the night, you may recall. He asked a question about the gasoline prices, and I pointed out they've gone, well, from roughly about a buck 86 a gallon when the president was elected to $4 a gallon, and Philip wanted to know why they've gone up so much. And the president's answer — you remember this? He said, well, the economy has gotten stronger. [laughter]
Now, on that basis, when we have a real recovery, he would suggest gasoline prices are going to up to six (dollars) or $8. Is that what he's saying? [laughter] I mean, this — this was the most classic of the nonanswers of the night. I think it's pretty clear that when it comes to his policies and his answers and his agenda, he's pretty much running on fumes, and the American people want some real answers and a real agenda, and that's why Paul Ryan and I are going to become the next president and vice president of the United States. [cheers and applause]
Now, we take America in two very different places, and I think that's very clear by virtue of what you've heard over the last two debates and probably will over the third as well. One is, the president will put America in a place that has about $20 trillion in debt, killing the American dream for your kids. If I become president, I'm going to take the action to make sure that we cap our federal spending, we limit federal spending as a percentage of our total economy, and we finally get America on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
If President Obama were re-elected, his spending plan and his borrowing and the debt on that borrowing will cause not only high-income people to see higher taxes, but ultimately, you're going to see middle-income people in this country facing $4,000 more in taxes. When I become president of the United States, I'm going to lower taxes on the middle class — [cheers and applause] — and on small business to help people — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
I think he made it clear as well the last couple of debates that if he's re-elected, why, we're going to have "Obamacare," including $716 billion of cuts to Medicare. And I hope you know what that means. [boos] Doctors are saying — half the doctors in America are saying they're not going to take additional Medicare patients because of that. Think about that as you're thinking about retiring, what that means. That's what his cut in Medicare means. And why did he take that money in Medicare? To pay for "Obamacare." I will repeal "Obamacare," replace it and put that $716 billion back. [cheers and applause]
And then — and then — and then there was his jobs plan, or lack of a jobs plan. He just keeps on saying what he said before: We needed a — a stimulus; we need to hire more government workers. There's nothing wrong with working in government, but hiring more government workers doesn't get the private sector growing and put people to work. Raising taxes — that's the other part of his plan, also picking winners and losers. I mean, from my calculation, he made about seven big loans to companies in his first year in office. Of those seven big loans, three of the companies have gone bankrupt, and one more is in — is in fragile condition.
Look, we don't need the government picking winners and losers, or in his case, losers. We need to get back to free people making their own choices in their lives. [cheers and applause] Let the free market choose the winners and the losers.
My plan — and you heard it time and again — I'm going to get this economy going, because I really believe in these things.
All right? I believe that it makes sense to take advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear, renewables. [cheers and applause] I believe in those things; I don't just talk about it. And the president is very — makes it very clear that he does not believe in oil and coal and gas like I believe in oil and coal and gas. And that's why, if I'm president, we're going to get — see North America energy-independent in eight years. [cheers and applause] And if he's president, you will not; you'll see higher and higher prices. That's one difference. [cheers and applause]
There's another place — there's another place I'm going to get the economy going: with trade. We're going to open up more trade, particularly in Latin America, and crack down on China. He said last night that he's filed all these actions against China. And — and he says we've won every one that — that has been adjudicated. Yeah, that's one. That's one. [laughter] All right? My — my own view is that we need to label China what it is, a currency manipulator, and apply tariffs wherever they're stealing our intellectual property or competing in an unfair manner. [cheers and applause]
I want training programs that work for our workers, that fix our schools. Number four, I will get us to a balanced budget. And number five, I'm going to champion small business. We've got to have small business. [cheers and applause] That's where our jobs comes from. And if you have a small business — I disagree with the president — if you have a small business — those of you who work at a small business — you built that business yourself. [cheers and applause] Government didn't build it for you.
And so this election is going to come down to being a choice between new — two different Americas: an America where government makes the rules, where government is a — larger and larger, where it takes more and more from the American people, where it runs more of our businesses and increasingly runs our lives — (chorus of noes); or instead an America where we restore the principles that made the nation that — the nation it is, that we — that we bring back the principles of the Declaration of Independence, recognize that God gave us our rights — [cheers and applause] — and they include life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the right to pursue happiness — [inaudible]. [cheers and applause]
I have — I mean, I — look, we all value and respect our government and the work that government has to do and recognize its role in our society. But its role is to help encourage free people and to allow dreamers to reach for their dreams; to — to provide education, so opportunity's there; to keep the burden of government from being too large; to keep it from smothering enterprise and freedom and opportunity.
The president doesn't understand the power of the American spirit, I don't think. In some respects, just — he — he says he loves free enterprise, but he thinks government somehow has to get in there and pull all the strings. Government needs to encourage free enterprise, but then let the people pursue their own dreams, pursue their own visions, pursue happiness as they know it.
And I — [cheers and applause] — and I know — I know something about the greatness of the American spirit. I — I'm convinced that despite all the challenges we face, the debt and the joblessness — the — the challenges we face around the world, schools that are not performing as they should, all of those challenges, I'm convinced, are going to be overcome not by government but by the American spirit, by free people doing what needs to be done to make America stronger.
I — I've seen the spirit of America throughout my life. One of my favorite experiences happened a number of years ago that just cemented again in my mind the great qualities of the human spirit that are seen day-in and day-out in American citizens across this country.
I — I happened to be at a — a Boy Scout Court of Honor. [cheers] And — a few Boy Scouts here — Boy Scouters here, all right. [cheers and applause] And I was seated up front at the Formica table, and — and there was a flagpole next to it with a flag on it. And — and the person speaking at the microphone was — was a fellow from Monument, Colorado. And he said that when he was back in Colorado that the Boy Scout troop that he was responsible for wanted to have a special flag.
And so they purchased a flag with gold tassels around it, and they had that flag flown above the Capitol.
And when it came back, the — the boys said, I wonder if we could have our flag go on the space shuttle. They contacted NASA and said, we've got this special flag for our Boy Scout troop. Would you take it up on the space shuttle? Space is at a premium in space, you know, so — [laughter] — I'm sure they were kind of reluctant to take souvenirs for Boy Scout troops. But they — they said, OK, we'll take your flag. So they put it on the shuttle. And he said, you can imagine how proud our boys were to be sitting in their homerooms at school and to watch that shuttle launch and to say to their friends, our flag's on the shuttle. And then they saw it explode in the air.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Ohh.
MR. ROMNEY: And he said he called NASA. And he said, have you found any remnant of our flag? And they hadn't. He said he called every week for months — have you found something of our flag? Nothing, nothing. And then he said in about September — this is about half a year or three-quarters of a year later. He's reading an article in the paper that described some of the debris found from the Challenger disaster. And on there it mentioned something about a flag. So he called NASA again, and they said, in fact we have found something we'd like to present to you.
And so NASA and the Boy Scout troop and their parents all came together for a presentation. And they handed the Boy Scouts a little plastic container. And they opened the container, and inside was their flag in perfect condition. [cheers and applause] And then the Scoutmaster said — [inaudible] — flagpole next to Mr. Romney. And I — I reached over, and I — I grabbed that flag and — and held it out. And it was as if electricity was running through my arms as I thought about the heroes, the patriots, Americans who live for something bigger than themself (sic), who live for pioneering and discovery, for new knowledge — not for themselves but for the world and for America.
That's — that's the nature of who we are.
And look across this country. Every day I see people who live for something bigger than themselves. Pioneers, heroes. I think of single moms wondering how they're going to put food on the table at the end of the week and scrimping and saving to be able to do so. I think of some dads and moms taking two jobs so they can afford to give their kids the same kind of clothes other kids are wearing at school. I — I think about young people coming out of college and putting aside their career because they feel it would be an honor and a duty to serve in our military. I think about parents, Christmas time coming up, saying let's not exchange gifts so we have enough to make sure our kids a great Christmas.
This is — this is who we are as a people. The divisiveness we've seen in Washington has spread across this nation. It's got to stop. Got to bring people together. We can talk about differences on issues without making personal attacks. We got to draw on the great American spirit, encourage people who lift themselves. [cheers and applause]
I'm — I'm in awe — I'm in awe of this community, in awe of those who serve in our military. What a — what an indication of — of willing to live above yourself and beyond yourself. I — I love that line in one of our national hymns: O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Would our veterans and members of the armed services please raise your hands so we recognize you? [cheers and applause] A great military town.
Twenty days, twenty days we decide what kind of an America we're going to have. [cheers and applause] Twenty days we decide how much debt we're going to leave to our kids. Twenty days we decide if we want a real recovery or not. Twenty days we decide whether we're going to fundamentally change America into something we wouldn't recognize or restore to America the principles that made us the hope of the Earth.
I'm counting on you. [cheers and applause] We have 20 days. I'm going to do everything in my power to get America back and I need your help. I thank you for being here. Get out and vote. Get your friends to vote. Let's take back this great country. Let's restore what makes America America. Thank you so very much. Great to be with you! Thank you! (Extended cheers, applause.)

Remarks at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City

October 18, 2012

Thank you. [applause] Thank you. [applause] Thank you. Thank you so much. Your Eminence Cardinal Dolan, Mr. president, Governor Cuomo, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Schumer, Al and Ann Smith, thank you for your invitation. Thank you for your extraordinary warm welcome. Ann and I appreciate your friendship very, very much. Thank you. [applause]
Now, AL, you are right. A campaign can require a lot of wardrobe changes. We — blue jeans in the morning perhaps, a suit for a lunch fundraise, sport coat for dinner. But it's nice to finally relax and to wear what Ann and I wear around the house. [laughter and applause] I'm glad to be able to join in this venerable tradition. Of course, I'm pleased that the president's here. We were chatting pleasantly this evening as if Tuesday night never happened. [laughter]
And I credit that of course to the cardinal. It's taken New York's highest spiritual authority to get us back on our best behavior. I was actually hoping the president would bring Joe Biden along this evening because he'll laugh at anything. [laughter and applause] Of course, this isn't a night for serious politics and it was especially nice to see President Obama and Cardinal Dolan sharing the dais despite their differences. I'm sure the cardinal has no hard feelings and we might get an indication of that during dinner to see if the president's wine turns into water. Or for that matter, whether my water turns into wine. [laughter]
I'm pleased to once again have the chance to see Governor Cuomo who's already being talked about for higher office — a very impressive fellow. But he may be getting a little ahead of himself. I mean, let me get this straight. The man has put in one term as a governor, he has a father who happened to be a governor and he thinks that's enough to run for president. [laughter and applause] Of course, we're down to the final months of the president's term. As presidents — [laughter].
As President Obama surveys the Waldorf banquet room, with everyone in white tie and finery, you have to wonder what he's thinking. So little time, so much to redistribute. [laughter and applause] And don't be surprised if the president mentions this evening the monthly jobs report where there was a slight improvement in the numbers.
He knows how to seize the moment, this president, and already has a compelling new campaign slogan: you're better off now than you were four weeks ago. [laughter] You know, with or without all the dignitaries that are here, the Al Smith Dinner surely lives up to its billing. Usually when I get invited to gatherings like this, it's just to be the designated driver. [laughter and applause]
Your kind hospitality here tonight gives me a chance to convey my deep and long held respect for the Catholic Church. I have special admiration for the Apostle St. Peter, to whom it is said: upon this rock I will build my church. The story's all the more inspiring when you consider that he had so many skeptics and scoffers at the time who were heard to say: if you've got a church, you didn't build that. [laughter]
Of course, only 19 days to go until the finish line, campaign full of surprises. The debates are very exciting. Just the other night we had a very fun debate. Candy Crowley was there and was happy to welcome us. But people seem to be very curious as to how we prepare for the debates. Let me tell you what I do. First, refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate. [laughter] Second, find the biggest available straw man and then just mercilessly attack it. Big Bird didn't even see it coming. [laughter]
And by the way, in the spirit of Sesame Street, the president's remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter O and the number 16 trillion. [laughter] Campaigns can be grueling, exhausting. President Obama and I are each very lucky to have one person who's always in our corner, someone who we can lean on and someone who's a comforting presence without whom we wouldn't be able to go another day. I have my beautiful Ann. He has Bill Clinton. [laughter]
We got a big dose of the Biden charm last week, I'll tell you that, in his debate with Paul Ryan. I'm not sure that all that carrying on had quite the effect that Joe intended because afterwards I heard from the Federal Election Commission. From now on, whenever he appears on TV, there's a recording immediately afterwards that says: I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message. [laughter] Of course, rules of fairness have to be enforced because what other safeguard do we have besides the press, and — (laughter, applause).
Now, I'd never suggest that the press is biased. I recognize they have their job to do and I have my job to do. My job is to lay out a positive vision for the future of the country. And their job is to make sure no one else finds out about it. [laughter and applause] Let's just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things. When suddenly I pulled ahead in some of the major polls, what was the headline? Polls show Obama leading from behind. [laughter] And I've already seen early reports from tonight's dinner. Headline: Obama embraced by Catholics. Romney dines with rich people. [laughter and applause]
Of course, the president has put his own stamp on relations with the church. There've been some awkward moments, like when the president pulled Pope Benedict aside to share some advice on how to deal with his critics. He said, look, Holy Father, whatever the problem is, just blame it on Pope John Paul II. [laughter] Of course, the president has found a way to take the sting out of the "Obamacare" mandates for the church. From now on, they're going to be in Latin. [laughter]
We have very fundamental and sound principles that guide both the president and me. He and I of course feel the pressures and tensions of a close contest. It'd be easy to let a healthy competition give way to the personal and the petty. But fortunately, we don't carry the burden of disliking one another. Our president has had some very fine and gracious moments. Don't tell him when I said so but our 44th president has many gifts and a beautiful family that would make any man proud. You can oppose — [applause].
In our country, you can oppose someone in politics and make a confident case against their policies without any ill will and that's how it is for me. There's more to life than politics. At the Al Smith Foundation and the Archdiocese of New York, you show this in the work you do, in causes that run deeper than allegiance to party or to any contest of the moment.
No matter which way the political winds are blowing, what work goes on day in and day out by this organization and you, you answer with calm and with wiling hearts, in service to the poor, in care for the sick, in defense of the rights of conscience and in solidarity with the innocent child waiting to be born. You strive to bring God's love into every life. [applause]
I don't presume to have all your support and on a night like this I'm certainly not going to ask for it. But you can be certain that in the great causes of compassion that you come together to embrace that I stand proudly with you as an ally and friend. God bless you all and God bless the United States of America. Thank you. [applause]

Remarks with Paul Ryan at a Campaign Event in Daytona Beach, Florida

October 19, 2012

RYAN: Thank you. Thank you, Daytona! Thank you, Florida! [applause] Hey, Florida! Hey, Florida! You ready to make this man the next president of the United States? [applause]
Thank you so much for coming out tonight. I want to thank John Rich. Man, what a great performer. Thank you so much, John Rich. That was fantastic. I want to thank Connie Mack and Pam Bondi. Thank you for being here today. Jeff Atwater and John Thrasher, you've been such a great help. We appreciate your service to Florida, your service to your country. Thank you very much. [applause]
Friends, we have a very clear choice to make. This is no ordinary election. We're not just picking a president for the next four years. We are picking the destiny of our nation, the meaning of our nation. We are deciding the kind of people we're going to be and the kind of country we are going to have for at least a generation. [applause]
We simply cannot afford four more years like the last four years. [applause] We need real reforms for a real recovery. We need to get the country back on the right track. And the way we do that is in 18 days we elect this man the next president of the United States. [applause] Now, we hear a lot from President Obama and I'm sure you'll to see him cross-crossing Florida.
Let me give you a quote that he said just four years ago. If you don't have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare people. If you don't have a record to run on, paint your opponent as someone people should run from. Make a big election about small things. That's what Barack Obama said when he was running for president in 2008. That's exactly what Barack Obama has become now that he is president in 2012 and we're going to change it because this man's going to be the next president and we're going to fix the mess in Washington.
We're going to get this country back on the right track. We're going to deal with what needs to be dealt with. We're going to fix these problems. [applause] We have got to fix the mess in Washington. [applause] Look, I just came in on town and I saw a lot of our Milwaukee Maine Harleys mollies running all around town here. [applause]
We know how to build things in America. We know how to create jobs in America. We know what freedom looks like in America. We know what liberty looks like in America. We believe that the government works for us and not the other way around in America because those are the principles that built America. People are hurting. Twenty-three million people are struggling for work. Fifteen percent of our fellow Americans are living in poverty. The president is out of ideas.
All of his borrowing, all of his spending, all of his regulating, all of his Washington-knows-best is not working. And you know what, if we attack these problems, if we stop blaming other people and start solving problems we can get people back to work in this country. We can grow this economy. We can bring opportunity. [applause]
What we need is leadership. We don't want "Obamacare." We want freedom. [applause] We don't want tax increases. We want government to live within its means. We don't want government borrowing and spending. We want it to actually cut spending so we don't give our children and our grandchildren a diminished future. [applause]
But to do this, we need leadership. Look at this man. Of all things that describe Mitt Romney, the one word that rushes to your mind is he is a leader. [applause] Look at this man's — [applause] This is a man who succeeded where others failed. This is a man who turned around the Olympics. This is a man who started successful business, who turned around struggling businesses, and by the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing. [applause]
There's nothing wrong with that. We want more people to become successful. In a time when America has a jobs crisis, wouldn't it be great to have a job creator in our White House? [applause] This is a man who when he was governor he didn't demonize and demagogue the other party. He reached across the aisle. He didn't compromise principle. He found common ground and he got things done. He cut taxes 19 times. He balanced the budget each and every year without raising taxes. That is leadership. That is what we need in the White House. [applause]
President Obama is trying to make a big election about small things. He's hoping that you won't look at reality. He's hoping that you won't see what's right in front of you. He's hoping that he can distort our record. He's hoping he can distract you to win an election by default. We're not going to fall for that, are we?
AUDIENCE: No!
REP. RYAN: America is so special. It's so unique. I can hear the hogs and the v-rods right outside right now. [applause] I see the veterans who are here in the audience. It's on your hats. Thank you for what you've done for our country. You have secured our freedoms and our rights. [applause]
America is more than a nation with a flag. It is an idea. It's the only country founded on an idea and the idea is really simple. And the idea has to be kept and maintained by every generation. Our rights come from nature and nature's God, not from government. That's the American idea. [applause]
This is one of those times in our history where we will look back as the time we got it right. This is a time where the man and the moment are meeting perfectly. It's not too late to turn things around. It's not too late to get this right. It is not too late to confront our country's problems and get people out of poverty, get people back in the middle class, get our children the bright future they deserve like our parents got for us.
And the way we're going to do this is we're going to elect a president who is going to lead us. That man is standing right next to me. His name is Mitt Romney and he's going to be the next president of the United States of America. [applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Nicely done, nicely done. Wow, thank you. What a welcome! [applause]
AUDIENCE: Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, John Rich, for entertaining us here. Thank you, John Thrasher, senator, for all your help. Thank you Pam Bondi, attorney general, for her leadership. Thank you for Connie Mack that's going to be the next U.S. senator from Florida. [applause] Well, have you been watching the Obama campaign lately? It's absolutely remarkable. They have no agenda for the future, no agenda for America, no agenda for a second term. It's a good thing they won't have a second term. [applause]
They have — they've been reduced to petty attacks and silly word games. Just watch it. The Obama campaign has become the incredible shrinking campaign.
This is — this is a big country with big opportunities and great challenges and they keep on talking about smaller and smaller things. We have big ideas, bold ideas, a strong agenda. We're going to get America working again and that's why you're going to help elect the two of us. We're going to go to Washington and get this country on track. [applause]
Now, I was at an event the other day and now then you see a few protestors that come to Paul and my events and they like to chant four more years, four more years. And I ask them —
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: I mean, do you want — do you want four more years with 23 million Americas struggling to find a good job?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you want four more years with take-home pay going down every year?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you want four more years of being upside-down on your mortgage?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you want four more years where kids coming out of college, half of them can't find a job?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: How about this. Are you ready for four very different years?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, four years where we create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. [applause] Look, we can — we can endure 18 more days of the agenda of President Obama but we cannot endure four more years and that's why we're going to replace him in 18 days. [applause]
Now, the four years that you're going to see under the two of us can be very --are going to be very, very different. Under President Obama's four more years, you're going to have at the end of it almost $20 trillion of debt, America on a road to becoming more like Greece, people wondering whether we're going to be able to meet our obligations. If I become president, you're going to see four years where we get America on track to cut spending, to cap federal spending and finally get on track to a balanced budget. [applause]
Look, if President Obama's reelected, these next four years you're going to see Medicare cut by $716 billion. This is something which I think seniors across Florida and across the country don't understand. The president's cutting Medicare $716 billion for current Medicare recipients to pay for "Obamacare." We're going to restore those dollars into Medicare and honor the promise made to our seniors. [applause] If the president were reelected, you're going to see higher taxes, higher taxes on small business and you're also going to see middle income people facing $4,000 a year in higher taxes. If I'm elected, we're going to reduce taxes on middle income Americans. [applause]
If the president's reelected, you're going to see "Obamacare" installed and that means that your health insurance premiums are going to go up another $2,500 a family.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: If I get elected — no, when I get elected, we're — [applause]. We're going to repeal "Obamacare" and get real health care reform that keeps down the growing cost of health care. [applause] If the president's reelected, you're going to see about a trillion dollars in cuts to our military with impact on our veterans.
AUDIENCE: Boo!
MR. ROMNEY: Let me tell you, when I'm president I will not cut our military budget. We must defend America's strength. [applause] And the president — the president has no jobs agenda. We keep on asking him what are you going to do to create jobs. He has nothing new. He says, well, we're going to go forward — forewarned is a better term, I think. We've seen where his stimuluses (sic) and trying to hire more government workers. Nothing wrong with government workers but that's not going to get the economy going.
Raising taxes won't create more jobs. Look, he doesn't know what it takes to create jobs. We do — five things. Number one, we're going to take advantage of our energy resources, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, renewables. We're going to get more trade, trade with Latin America and crack down on China when they steal our jobs unfairly. We're going to get our people the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow. It means also fixing our schools for our kids to make sure they have a great opportunity for the future. I love our teachers. We're going to put our teachers and the kids and the parents first and the teachers union behind. [applause]
We're going to get that balanced budget and number five, we're going to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. [applause] And you know what, if you've got a small business, you did build that, all right? [applause] Look, the president wants to fundamentally transform America. He's making us more and more like Europe. I don't want to become like Europe. I want to restore to America the principles that made us the hope of the Earth and we'll do it. [applause]
I'm optimistic. I'm optimistic about the future. I'm optimistic about the future because I've had the chance to meet people across this country and learn something about the great heart of the American people. We're a generous people. We're a patriotic people. We work hard as a people. We love America. I was at a rally and I saw great people that were talking about their lives and their passion for America. It taught me again how much I love the American people. How much I believe in the people of America, how much I believe in this country and our future. America's best days are ahead of us, not in the past. [applause]
Some years ago I was at a Boy Scout court of honor. Any Boy Scouts here? Yeah, good. So a Boy Scout court of honor, I was at the end of the table — a Formica table. They had an American flag there next to where I was and the scoutmaster who was at the podium was talking about a special flag his scout troop wanted to have. He was from Monument, Colorado. They got this flag. It was a big one with gold tassels around the outside.
And they had it flown above the capitol to make it special and then they contacted NASA and they said, we'd like you to fly this flag on the space shuttle. And I guess space is at a premium in space. So you know, the idea of taking souvenirs was not NASA's first idea but they said OK. And he said, you could imagine how great it was for our kids to be in their homerooms watching the TV screen as they saw the shuttle launch go off and then they saw it explode on the TV screen.
And this scoutmaster said he got in touch with NASA and he said, have you found any remnant of our flag. And they said no. And he said he called every week, month after month, have you found our flag or any remnant of it. And the answer was always no. And after several months he finally gave up. And then one day he was looking at the newspaper and it listed some of the debris found from the Challenger disaster and there was a mention of a flag. So he called NASA and he said, did you find our flag. They said, as a matter of fact, we have a presentation to make to you and your boys.
And so NASA came together with the Boy Scout troop and they presented them with this plastic kind of box, this container. And he said, we opened the box and there was our flag in perfect condition. And he said, that's it on the flagpole at the end of the table next to Mr. Romney. And I reached over and grabbed that flag and held it out. And it was as if electricity was running through my arm because I thought about the sacrifice of those astronauts, how many of them have gone in danger's path, seeking knowledge and innovation, pioneering for us, for our future.
I think about the men and women who serve in our military, willing to serve themselves for the benefit of this great country. How many veterans do we have, our veterans and members of the Armed Forces? Thank you. [applause] O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Thank you to our veterans and to those who serve. [applause]
We as a people live for something bigger than ourselves. That's who we are, those in the military, those who were pioneers in NASA and continue to be. The mom — the single mom who scrimps and saves so she can put a good meal on the table at the end of the day, the dad that's got two jobs — two jobs so he can make sure his kids have the kind of clothes the other kids have at school, the mom and dad who agree they're not going to exchange gifts at Christmastime so they can give their kids a real Christmas.
This is who we are. We're a people who are bigger than ourselves. We give to others. That's what makes America so unique. We are an exceptional nation of great people. This is a critical time for this nation as we choose what kind of course we're going to have. The president's put us on a course of decline. We're going to restore the greatness of America, drawing on the greatness of the American people.
This is not a nation that's great because of our government. It's great because of the heart and passion of the American people. We're going to tap into this, grow this economy, get America strong again. Our bright future is ahead of us. We're going to win in November — November 6th. You guys are going to help get us elected. We're taking back America. We'll be strong again. Your kids will know the future is bright for them. Thank you so very much! You guys are the best! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks with Paul Ryan at a Campaign Event in Henderson, Nevada

October 23, 2012

[In progress] — tonight's debate. Here's his running mate, Paul Ryan.
REPRESENTATIVE PAUL RYAN (R-WI): Hey, everybody. Wow. [cheers and applause] Hello, Henderson. [cheers and applause] Hello, Nevada. [cheers and applause] It is great to see you guys. Wow. Thank you so much. Hey, Nevada, you ready to help us win this thing? [cheers and applause] That's right. Hey, don't forget, early voting already started. [cheers] You can get out there; you can cast your vote. We need your help.
We saw, last night and two other nights, a man who is ready to become a great president, and his name is Mitt Romney. [cheers and applause] And Nevada, you're going to help him — make him the next president of the United States. [cheers and applause]
I want to thank your fantastic lieutenant governor. I want to thank Brian Krolicki for what he's done for us, for what he's done for your state, for his leadership. [cheers and applause] I want to thank my buddy Dean Heller. [cheers and applause] [chuckles] He is a true Nevadan. You need to send him back. [cheers] And you got this new guy, a true citizen legislator, a doctor, a veteran: Joe Heck is the kind of man who has earned your support. Send him back. He is exactly the kind of people we need to save this country. [cheers and applause] You've got great leaders right here.
You know what we saw last night? We saw Governor Ritt (sic) Romney offer this country bold ideas and leadership. [cheers] In so many ways — and we know this right here, Nevada; look at the unemployment rate — we cannot afford four more years like the last four years. [cheers] You know what? Please, go ahead. Have a seat.
President Obama has not only failed to lay out his second-term agenda; President Obama has decided that his path to re-election is to distort, is to try and distract, to see if he can win this election by default. We're not going to fall for that, are we?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
REP. RYAN: You know, it was four years ago when then-Candidate Barack Obama was running for president.
He said this: If you don't have fresh ideas, then use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a big election about small ideas.
[chuckles] Ladies and gentlemen, that's exactly what he said four years ago. And sadly, that is exactly what President Obama has become. And in two weeks from today, he's going to become former President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's going to be the next president of the United States — [cheers and applause] — because we can do better than this. We don't have to settle for this.
We don't have to settle for 23 million Americans struggling to find work. We don't have to settle for 11.8 percent unemployment in Nevada.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
REP. RYAN: We don't have to settle for all these underwater mortgages.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
REP. RYAN: We don't have to settle for 15 percent of our fellow countrymen and -women living in poverty.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
REP. RYAN: We can do better than this.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!
REP. RYAN: It's going to take leadership. It's going to take a man with a plan. It's going to take a proven job creator — a person who's proven to reach across the aisle to find common ground to get results. It's going to take the kind of leader that we have before us. That leader is Mitt Romney. [cheers and applause]
You know what we saw last night? Yet again, another display of a man ready to be president, another display of someone with the demeanor, with the temperament, with the skills to be a leader. What we saw last night was Mitt Romney being concerned about America's position in the world and President Obama more concerned about his position in this race.
[cheers and applause]
Look, the president has run out of ideas. That's why he's running a small campaign about small things and hoping that he can distract people from the reality in front of us. The reality is this, we can do better than this. We can get people back to work. We can get people back out of poverty, back into the middle class. We can create jobs. We have so much energy in this state, in this country. Let's use that energy in this state, in this country and get people back to work. [cheers and applause]
We have a leader with a plan to create jobs. We have a leader who's a proven job creator. At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America, wouldn't it be nice to have a job creator in the White House? [cheers and applause]
Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have to wait for four more years of the same. We only have to wait for two more weeks to get America back on track. [cheers and applause] And that means in Nevada, Henderson, you can help us. Don't forget early voting. We're going to elect a leader to get us out of a ditch we are in, to get this country back on the right track. That man is right here. His name is Mitt Romney, and he's going to be the next president of the United States! [cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Wow. Wow. That's a Nevada welcome. Thank you, Nevada. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Henderson. Thank you, Nevada. Great to be with you. I need you to do something. I love the fact that you're cheering. Your cheering warms my heart. But I want you to make sure to begin voting. Early voting has already started. Vote. Get out there. We want you to start voting right now.
Now, my — my guess is you had the chance to watch that debate last night, maybe a couple of debates. [cheers and applause] Yeah. And these debates have supercharged our campaign. There's no question about it. We're seeing more and more enthusiasm, more and more support. We're going to make sure that these campaigns and the message of these — the debates, rather — these messages keep going across the country.
But I — you know, I had to look at the president's campaign as well through the eyes of those debates. And well, you know, he's — he's been reduced to trying to defend the characters on Sesame Street and the — [laughter] — word games of various kinds and — and then misfired attacks after one and another. You know, the — the truth is that attacks on me are not an agenda. The president — [cheers] — we've gone through four debates now. We've gone through four debates with the vice — vice presidential debate and my debates. And — and we haven't heard an agenda from the president. And that's why his campaign is taking on water and our campaign is full speed ahead. [cheers and applause]
Now, Paul mentioned two weeks from today that we have the final votes taken, but you guys need to get your votes out there early.
We need you to — to get in there early. But I want you to know that we can handle two more weeks of the attacks that are coming from Barack Obama, but we cannot handle four more years of what he's given us. [cheers and applause]
I mean, can you afford four more years with 23 million Americans looking for a good job?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Can you afford four more years with housing prices going down and — [inaudible] — bottom?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Can you afford four more years of doubling of the gasoline prices you're paying?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: How — how about this instead? Would you like to have four years where we create 12 million new jobs? [cheers and applause] How — how about four years — how about four years where we're able to see rising take-home pay again? [cheers and applause] And how about four years where at the end of which we get Nevada unemployment down to 6 percent or lower? [cheers and applause]
Look, if we're — if we're going to see a real recovery and see that kind of direction, then we're going to have to have real change. And unfortunately, we have a president today who represents the status quo. His campaign slogan is "Forward." That doesn't suggest changing, does it?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: All right, forward — well, I think a better campaign slogan for him might be "forewarned" — (laughter, cheers, applause) — because we've seen what's happened over the last four years. Look, I'm — I'm willing to do the work with Paul Ryan that it takes to change Washington. The president said you can't change Washington from the inside. He says he can only do it from the outside. We're going to give him that chance in just a couple of weeks. [cheers and applause]
You see, if we — if we go forward with the same direction of the last four years, he's going to keep on amassing a trillion-dollar deficit or so every year. We'll end up with $20 trillion in debt. America's future will look a lot like those troubled nations in Europe.
If, on the other hand, we take a new and bold course that Paul Ryan and I represent, we'll finally cut federal spending; we'll cap federal spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
Going — going forward with his same old policies, that'll mean that he's going to cut $716 billion from Medicare for our current seniors. [boos] That's the wrong way. [boos] Paul Ryan and I will restore those dollars to our seniors and to Medicare and make sure those programs are there for our kids and their kids. [cheers] We'll make sure we honor the promises made to our seniors. [cheers and applause]
Four more years — four more years like the last four years mean that we're going to cut a trillion dollars out of our military. [boos] Look, I — I have the greatest respect for the men and women who serve in our — in our armed forces and appreciate their great sacrifice. [cheers and applause] And I will not continue to reduce the number of ships we have and the number of planes we have and the number of soldiers we have. I'll make sure that we protect our military and keep it second to none in the world. [cheers and applause]
Four more years — four more years like the last four years, with all this spending and all the borrowing that you've seen, would mean that you're going to have an America where you're going to have interest costs going up and up and up, and the president's going to have to raise taxes $4,000 per middle-income family.
(Scattered boos.) He's also planning on raising taxes on a million small businesses. We have a very different path. The path we represent will not raise taxes. We'll cut taxes on the middle class. We'll cut taxes for small business. We're going to make it easier for businesses to grow. [cheers and applause]
Four more years like the last four years means that we would see "Obamacare," and that means that your health insurance premiums would go up by $2,500 a person. [boos] It puts the government in the doctor's office with you. Look, when we get elected, we're going to repeal "Obamacare" and get health care on track to slow down its extraordinary cost. [cheers and applause]
Four more years like the last four years would continue to have a president playing hide-and-seek trying to find a — a — a plan to get the economy going and to create jobs. This is a president whose — whose — whose approach to creating jobs is another stimulus. How'd the first one work out. (Jeers.)
And then — and then he says he wants to hire some more teachers. That's — we love teachers. We're — we're happy to see more teachers. But that's not going to get the private sector growing and — and people having good jobs again. His idea of growing the economy is raising taxes. Does anyone think raising taxes creates more jobs?
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Look, his — his — his vision for — for the future is a repeat of the past. We don't want to go into the past. Our plan has five key steps that'll get this economy going, because we're serious about these things.
We're going to finally get North American energy independence using our coal, our oil, our gas, our nuclear and our renewables.
[cheers and applause]
We're going to make trade work for America by making sure we open up new markets, particularly in Latin America. [cheers and applause] Latin America — we have advantages there with language and time zone. And we're going to crack down on cheaters when they steal our jobs through unfair trade practices, like China. We'll crack down; he has not. [cheers and applause]
We're going to make training programs work for the people who need training and fix our schools. By the way, we can fix our schools because we don't get the largest share of our campaign contributions from the teachers' unions. He does. [cheers] As a matter of fact, we get none of our campaign contributions from the teachers' unions. We're going to do something to fix our schools that needs to be done across the country, and that is we're putting our kids first and the parents first and the teachers first and the teachers' unions going behind. [cheers and applause]
And number five — number five is this: We're going to champion small business. [cheers and applause] We want small business to grow and thrive and to add more jobs. We want to help small-business people with lower taxes and — and regulators that see themselves as being on the same team, as opposed to being in opposition to small business. We're going to help small business grow and thrive in this country. [cheers] I understand small business. I didn't read about small business; I didn't study small business; I lived small business, and I'm going to help small business grow. [cheers and applause]
Look, his is a — his is a status-quo candidacy. His is a — a message of going forward with the same policies of the last four years. And that's why his campaign is — is slipping, and that's why ours is gaining so much steam. And I'm — [cheers and applause] — I'm convinced, as Paul said, we can do better. I know we can.
This is not just a matter of Paul and me; this is a movement across the country, people recognizing that we can do a better job as a nation than we've done over these last four years. I've seen it throughout my life, that in the heart of the American people is a greatness, a quality of the human spirit that tells me that if we tap into it, if we allow freedom to bloom as it can, that you're going to see this country come back and an economy that roars to success.
I say that — [cheers and applause] — I say that because I've seen the American people and I've seen the entrepreneurship of our fellow men and women. I believe we're all sons and daughters of the same God and we have within us a great desire — [cheers and applause] — to lift ourselves and our children. We want to help one another. We Americans — we Americans are willing to give of ourselves to something bigger than ourselves. We're a — we're a people who love great things. We're patriotic. We care for our communities. We care for our families. This is a — this is a time to call on America's greatness.
I had an experience that — that reminded me of that and touched my — my heart. I was — I was a leader in the Boy Scouts some years ago and — [cheers and applause] — (few ?) Scouters here — and it was in a Boy Scout Court of Honor, and we had this formica table. And I was seated at the end of it on the podium.
And the person who was speaking was the scout master from Monument, Colorado. (Cheer.) I hear a Coloradan back there somewhere. There we go. And he said that their Boy Scout troop wanted to have a very special flag.
And — and so they bought one, and it was a — a flag which had the gold tassels around the outside. And — and next to me, at the end of this Formica table, was a flagpole with a — a flag on it, very much like the one he was describing.
And he said, look, we bought this flag. We wanted it to be special, and so we had it flown above the Capitol building. And — and then when it came home, back to Monument, Colorado, we — we contacted NASA and said, gosh, could we have our flag go up on the space shuttle? And of course, space is at a premium in space, you know, so — [laughter] — but NASA said, OK, we'll take the boys' flag with us. And they put it on the space shuttle. And he said, you can imagine how proud our boys were, looking from their homerooms at school on the TV set as they launched the — the — the shuttle takeoff and the rockets go up in the air. And — and they had that pride until they saw it explode on the TV screen in front of them.
And he said he called NASA about two weeks after the disaster, the Challenger disaster, and said, have you found any remnant of our flag? And they said no. And then he said he called almost every week for months: Have you found our flag? Every time he called, they said no. And then I think it was in September; he was reading an article in the newspaper that listed some of the debris from the Challenger disaster, and it mentioned a flag. So he called NASA again, and they said, as a matter of fact, we have a presentation to make to you. And so NASA came and Boy Scouts came, and they presented the Boy Scouts with this plastic container. And he said, we opened it up, and there was our flag in perfect condition. And —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Aww. [cheers and applause]
MR. ROMNEY: And then he said, that's the flag on the flagpole next to Mr. Romney. And I — I — I looked over and reached up and grabbed ahold of the flag and pulled it out. And for me it was as if electricity was running through my arm as I was thinking of the sacrifice of our sons and daughters, men and women in the space program that have sacrificed and put themselves in danger for learning, for discovery, for us.
And I think about how much that typifies the American character. I think of the — the single mom who scrimps and saves on herself so that she can have a good meal for her child at the end of the week. I think of — I think of the dad that's got a couple of jobs so he can afford making sure his kids have the same kind of clothes other kids at school have.
I think of the — of the couple that decides not to share Christmas with each other this year, not to exchange gifts, so they can instead have a great Christmas for their children. I think of the young person coming out of college or out of high school who puts aside their — their career so they can enlist in the military.
I love those who serve in America's armed forces. [cheers and applause] Would all those who have have served in our armed forces or are serving now please stand or raise your hand and be recognized by the audience. [cheers and applause]
I love those — I love those words in one of our national hymns: O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country (love/loved ?), and mercy more than life. I love these members of our armed services and the fact that they, like so many others, evidence this quality of living for something bigger than themselves.
This is a — [cheers and applause] — this is an important time for America.
This is a time to choose what kind of an America we're going to be. Are we going to draw on the greatness of our people and their willingness to sacrifice for great things, or are we instead going to turn to government and expect it to do everything for us? Are we going to have a nation that's free, that recognizes that our economy is driven by freedom and economic opportunity, or are we instead going to have an economy that stumbles along and bumps along with high unemployment, low-wage growth, home values down, high gasoline prices? (Murmurs of disapproval.) This is the choice we're going to have.
And what I need you to do is to get out there and vote, and vote early. In some states, it's vote early and vote often, but not here in Nevada, right, Governor? [laughter] Governor Krolicki is saying, no, no, no, not here. I need you to get out and vote because on Election Day, I need you to get your friends to vote.
Over the next two weeks Paul Ryan and I are going to work nonstop crisscrossing the country to get people to get energized and to get out and vote. And while we're doing that, I need you to do something. I need you to find a neighbor who voted for Barack Obama last time and remind them of the promises made and ask how many of those promises were kept. And after you take them through that, they're going to realize it's time to vote for real change that'll get this economy going.
We're going to get America back. [cheers and applause] We're going to take this country, get good jobs, rising take-home pay, keep us strong overseas, support our military. America is coming back. This is the comeback team. I love America. I believe in you. I believe our brightest days are ahead. Thank you so very much. Sure love you. Thank you for being here. (Sustained cheers, applause.)

Remarks with Paul Ryan at a Campaign Event in Morrison, Colorado

October 23, 2012

RYAN: Thank you, wow! Look at this! Wow! [applause] Hello, Colorado! [applause] Look at this! We love you guys. Hey, Colorado — Colorado — hey, Colorado, are you ready to help us win this thing? [applause] Man, that's right sir, we can do this. We will do this. I want to thank this great governor of New Mexico, Susana Martinez. Thank you so much. [applause] And let's hear it for Rodney Atkins and for Kid Rock. Guys, awesome, thank you so much. [applause]
We've got some great Colorado leaders here — Cory Gardner, Bob Beauprez, Mike Coffman, Joe Coors. Thank you guys for all your leadership. Thank you for putting your necks on the line for us. [applause] We love Colorado. We've been coming out here since I was a little guy. My wife every year in childhood went to this little place called Lost Valley Ranch out in Pike National Forest. We've been coming out fishing, skiing, mountain biking, climbing. This is a beautiful state and this beautiful state is going to deliver Mitt Romney as the next president of the United States, isn't it? [applause]
And you know what we saw last night? Last night we witnessed for the third time a man who is ready to be a great president. [applause] And what we witnessed was a man with a vision, a man with bold ideas, a man with solutions. What we also witnessed was a president who's out of ideas. We witnessed a president who really has no record to run on. What we witnessed is a president who is simply offering more of the same. And you know what, Colorado, we can't afford four more years like these last four years. We need to elect Mitt Romney to put us back on the right track. [applause]
You see, all that President Obama is offering is more of the same — more borrowing, more spending, more taxing, more money printing. If that would work, we would be entering a golden age along with Greece. It doesn't work. Four years ago, he came here to Denver. He offered so much hope, so much change.
Candidate Obama then said if you don't have any fresh ideas, you use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a record to run on, you paint your opponent as someone to run from. You make a big election about small things. That's what he said four years ago. Sadly, that is exactly what he has become and we're not going to fall for it, are we? [applause]
We saw the clear choice yet again last night. We saw that Governor Romney is offering a specific plan. You see, this election we're not just picking the next president for four more years. We are picking the direction and the course of our country for a generation. This is that kind of an election. [applause] It doesn't matter what generation you come from. This is the most important election in your generation. [applause]
And while Mitt Romney is offering specific solutions, plans to get the 23 million people struggling for work to find a job, President Obama is scrapping to try and keep his job by distorting Mitt Romney, by trying to distract voters to try and win by default and we're not going to fall for it, are we?
AUDIENCE: No!
REP. RYAN: Of all those times, this is one of those times where the man and the moment are meeting so well. We need leadership. We have serious problems. We need leadership. Of all the things we know about Mitt Romney, the one word that rushes to your mind is this man is a leader. This man is a job creator. [applause]
He turned around the Olympics. He helped create tens of thousands of jobs as a successful businessman, and by the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing. There's nothing wrong with that. We think that's good. We want more people to become successful. [applause] We take pride in that.
When he was governor of a Democratic state, did he demean and demoralize and demagogue the Democrats? No. He reached across the aisle. He didn't compromise principle but he found common ground and he got things done. He balanced a budget without raising taxes. That's the kind of leader we need in the White House right now, someone who's going to get things done. [applause]
At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America, wouldn't it be nice to have a job creator in the White House? [applause] The president's run out of ideas. He's going to try and distract you for the next two weeks. We're not going to fall for it because what we're offering is to give you, our fellow countrymen and women, a clear choice. It's a plan to get us back to work, to bring us back together, to leave our kids and our grandkids a debt-free nation, to grow the economy, to create jobs, to use our energy to get people back out of poverty, back in the middle class.
It takes leadership and here is what we are committing. We are not going to duck these tough issues. We're not going to kick the can down the road. We're going to lead. [applause] And we're not going to spend four years blaming other people. We're going to take responsibility and fix this mess in Washington. [applause] And we are not going to try to transform this country into something it was never intended to be. We are going to reclaim and reapply those founding principles that made us great, that our veterans right here fought for. This is that we're going to do.
The man who's going to do this is right here. The man who's going to put us back on the right path, the man that Colorado is going to deliver, the man who's going to be our next president of the United States is right here. His name is Mitt Romney and here he is, the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney. [applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Colorado! Wow, that's a Colorado welcome, I've got to tell you. [applause] Thank you! Boy, what a — what a place this is. This is — [applause]. This is a magnificent — this is a magnificent place for a guy born in Detroit to come here and look at these extraordinary mountains. You look at the handiwork of our creator and it's just — it's just overwhelming. [applause]
Of course, there's nothing more impressive — there's nothing more impressive, of course, than the handiwork of creating a child of God and we're all brothers and sisters in a human family that right now wants to see the kind of leadership that America can bring to the world. And Paul Ryan and I intend to bring it with your help. [applause]
And you — you hear the word — you hear the word grassroots from time to time, about how the grassroots are involved. You recognize that the most important thing in helping change the course of a nation and setting the course on a path that will lead to greatness and prosperity again and again, that is the grassroots of America. That's the people of America. That's who we are tonight. That is you and your willingness to be here tonight. [applause] It makes the difference. And you're voting.
By the way, there's early voting now. You can take your ballots and send them in if you've got them and you can early vote.
You guys, if you've got our absentee ballots, make sure and send it in. If you haven't got one, get into the center to make sure that you get voted early. We want to get that done. We want to bank all those votes so that on Election Day you can go out and get those people to the polls that otherwise wouldn't get there. Will you do that for me? [applause]
Now, my — my heart is — my heart is full. My heart is full because of so many friends here and that includes you but also it includes Governor Susana Martinez who's come here from New Mexico to welcome me and introduce us. [applause] And Rodney Atkins, we listen to Rodney's music almost every day because on the campaign trail we play it.
When we come by afterwards and shake some hands it's Rodney's music we listen to. He's a great patriot. I love him, love listening to him. [applause] And Kid Rock is a Detroit guy and I was born in Detroit as well. And so, we hear "Born Free" every day as well and recognize what a privilege it is to be born in the nation, the greatest nation in the history of the Earth that enjoys freedom and shares it with our friends around the world. Thanks, Kid Rock. [applause]
And just before I came in here, I met another Colorado great — to see Todd Helton and to see his support means the world. [applause] Now, I'm not sure how busy you've been the last few weeks but did you get a chance to watch the debates? [applause] They have — they have supercharged our campaign, I've got to tell you that. And you know we're on the home stretch now and I think the people of Colorado are going to get us all the way there. What do you think? [applause]
What you're seeing — what you're seeing across this country as we've had these debates and as Paul and I have gone across the nation, you're seeing this movement growing. You're seeing people coming together to say, you know, we love America, we recognize we could do better. I came in and some of the folks here were holding signs, Democrats for Romney, all right. I love that, I love that. [applause]
You see, Paul and I have a few things in common. One is we've both learned how to reach across the aisle in our elected office to find ways to work with Democrats, Republicans, Independents to get the job done. And we need you to reach across the neighborhood to Democrats and Independents as well. Make sure they understand that this is a year to vote for real change if you want to have real recovery. I need you to get those folks to vote for us. [applause]
And if — and if they ask you, well, why should we vote for Mitt and Paul instead of the team that's there now, you've got a lot of things you can tell them. But one is this. Say look at the Obama campaign. It's reduced to talking about smaller and smaller things. They're talking about saving characters on Sesame Street. They're talking about silly word games. Day in and day out, there's one attack after the other and attacks on us, that does not make an agenda for the future. Our campaign is about getting this economy going, getting good jobs for the American people, leading in the world, protecting freedom and creating a bright and prosperous future. [applause]
What you're — what you're seeing from the Obama campaign is an incredibly shrinking campaign. Look, the president's out of ideas. He's out of excuses and in November you're going to make sure he's out of office. [applause] Look, Paul and I can handle two more weeks of attacks but I don't think America can handle four more years like the last four years. [applause] I mean — I mean, you think about it. You think about it. Do you think we can handle four more years where there are 23 million Americans that are out of work looking for a good job?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you think we can handle four more years with declining incomes every year?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Do you think we can handle four more years with declining home values?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: How about four more years with gasoline prices going up and up and up?
AUDIENCE: No!
MR. ROMNEY: Are you ready for a real recovery?
AUDIENCE: Yeah! [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: How about a —
AUDIENCE: Romney! Romney! Romney! [applause]
MR. ROMNEY: Well, if you want a real recovery, and I can tell by your response the answer is yes to that. If you want a real recovery, we're going to have to have a real change and the president said he was a president of change but in fact he's become a president of status quo and the policies of the president are a continuation of what we've seen over the last four years. He calls his campaign slogan forward. I call it forewarned, all right? [applause]
The president — the president said that he can't change Washington from the inside. He can only change it from the outside. Well, we're going to give him that chance, you see. [applause] And Paul — and Paul and I — Paul and I, by finding good Democrats and good Independents and Republicans, are going to work to change Washington from the inside and the different course that we would take from what the president would take is pretty stark in comparison. There's no question but if the president's reelected you're going to see at the end of four years about $20 trillion in debt. If Paul and I are elected, and we will be elected by you — [applause].
Then we're — then we're — then we're actually going to pull back federal spending and we're going to cap it at 20 percent of the economy and we're going to finally get America on track to a balanced budget. [applause] If the — if the president had his way, why he's going to cut $716 billion out of Medicare. If we get our way, we're going to put that money back in Medicare and honor the promises made to our seniors. [applause] If the — if the president has his way, why, you're going to see your health insurance premiums go up by about $2,500 a year because, you see, he'll install "Obamacare." We'll repeal "Obamacare" and finally get the kind of health care that holds down costs. [applause]
And there's no question in my mind but if the president were to be reelected, why, you would see unemployment stay at extremely high levels for additional years. This recovery has been more tepid than it should have been. Right now, he said we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment. We're 9 million jobs short of that. You think of that. These are real people living lives, that are having a hard time making ends meet, having a hard time planning and thinking about the future.
If you've been unemployed for any period of time you know it's not just about the money. It also has a big impact on how you feel about yourself and about your relationship with others and sometimes even your faith is tested. Look, these are tough times for a lot of Americans and the president's answer to this is another stimulus and more government workers and higher taxes. That hasn't worked. The right course for America is our 5-step plan to get America working. We're going to put it in place to get the jobs America needs. [applause]
And you — and you know what they are. My guess is as I tell them to you, you could say them as well, but don't. But number one, we're going to get North American energy independence within eight years. [applause] We're going to — to do that — to do that, we're going to take advantage of our coal, our oil, our natural gas, our nuclear and our renewables. [applause]
We're also — number two, we're going to take advantage of trade. We're going to make trade work for us. It's good for us to trade with other nations. That creates jobs for us, particularly in Latin America. There's opportunity there. Latin America's economy is almost as large as the economy of China and it's fast growing, a growing middle class. We need more trade with Latin America and we'll get it. And by the way, if nations cheat in trade, and China has cheated, I will stop it. We cannot allow them to steal our jobs on an unfair basis. (Applause.
)
We're going to — we're going to make sure our training programs help the people get the skills they need. We're going to make sure our schools are world class again and we're going to do that by doing a simple thing --making sure that in everything we do in education, the kids and the parents and the teachers come first and the teachers union and their interest is going to have to come behind. [applause]
Number four — number four, we are going to balance the budget because we're not going to have people come invest and start enterprises here unless they see that we're not on the road to Greece. If we keep spending more than we take in, we're going to sell our future. We're going to crush our kids with a massive debt. It's immoral. It's wrong. We have to have a balanced budget.
And number five, we're going to champion small business. We're going to make it easier for small business to grow and thrive. [applause] Small business — small business, by the way, is where the president intends to raise taxes. And raising taxes on small business kills jobs. Paul Ryan and I will not raise taxes on small business. We'll lower them and we'll lower taxes on the middle class in America. [applause]
You see, the president's status quo campaign, you know, going forward with the same ideas as we've seen over the last four years is why he's slipping and it's why our campaign is gaining. It's why this movement is growing across the country. And it's why we need you to go out and get other people and recruit you to this cause because we need to take back America and get America strong again, providing for our citizens a bright and prosperous future. [applause]
We can do better. We don't have to settle for what we've seen over the last four years. Americans are tired of being tired. We can do better. We have within us, within the American people, the entrepreneurial spirit to build businesses and grow them and to hire one another. We have the skills to be able to educate people with the opportunities they might have for a future. And of course, in this great country we have a series of qualities that in my view define some of the greatness of the human spirit.
I've throughout my life had the chance to see something about the heart of the American people. It's an unusual people in many respects. I'll tell you a story that you may have heard. I was a Boy Scout leader some years ago, and — [applause]. And I was at a — I was at a Boy Scout court of honor and there was a Formica table at the front of the room and at the end of the Formica table was a flagpole with a flag on it. I was sitting next to the flag.
And the person speaking at the podium was the scoutmaster from Monument, Colorado. [applause] And he said that the troop there in Monument had wanted to have a very special American flag so they bought one. It's one with the gold tassels around the outside. And they had it flown above the capitol building. And then when it came home they said, well, we could make it even more special if it went up on the space shuttle.
So they contacted NASA and said, would you take our flag with you on the space shuttle. And NASA said, well, you know, space is at a premium in space, but they said, sure, we'll take this Boy Scout souvenir on this — on this flight. And so he said the boys were so proud. They were looking from their homerooms on TV as they watched the shuttle launch and saw the rocket taking that shuttle in the air and then they saw it explode on the TV screen.
And he said, he called NASA a couple of weeks later. And he said he called every week for months and still no word of any remnant of the flag. And then I think it was about September he mentioned that he was looking through an article about some of the debris that had been found from the Challenger disaster and they mentioned a flag. And so he contacted NASA and they said, in fact, we do have a presentation to make to you.
And so the boys and their troop got together with a representative of NASA and the boys were handed this plastic container. And they opened the container and there was their flag in perfect condition. And — [applause]. And he said — and that's the flag at the end of the table next to Mr. Romney. It was on that flagpole. And so I reached out and I grabbed it and held it out and it was as if electricity was running through my arm because I thought of those astronauts and what they'd sacrificed and why they'd sacrificed — for learning, for discovery.
We're pioneers. It's in our nature to live for something bigger than ourself (sic), to give of ourselves for great things. It's what Americans do. [applause] I think of the young men and young women who graduate from high school or college and say, I'm going to put my career on the side. I'm going to go into the military and serve my country. It's that kind of spirit. [applause] How many in the audience this evening are members of the Armed Forces or veterans? Please raise your hand and be recognized. Wow. [applause] Thank you.
I love that stanza in one of our national hymns, that stanza that says: O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife who more than self their country loved and mercy more than life. Thank you to our veterans and members of our Armed Services. [applause] A nation, a people who would give to others — I think of a single mom who scrimps and saves so that she can provide a good meal to her child at the end of the day or to a dad that's got two jobs right now, two jobs so he can make sure that his kids have the clothes that don't make them look different from the other kids at school.
I think of the mom and dad who are saying to each other we're not going to exchange gifts this Christmas because we want to make sure our kids have a good Christmas. It is in our heart. It is in the American way to give to others. We're a compassionate and caring and patriotic and God-loving people. And this great nation is called upon right now to decide what kind of nation we want to be in the future.
And I'm convinced that the principles that made us the nation that we are principles that must be restored and extolled. And Paul Ryan and I will do that. We'll bring back the America that has been the hope of the Earth. And we need your help. We need — [applause].
Because it matters — it matters for your kids and their kids. It matters for 23 million Americans struggling to get a good job. It matters for the future of our planet to have a nation like ours, the leader of the world, strong and robust with a strong military and a strong economy and strong values and strong allies. It matters.
We're going to make it happen. Colorado, you need to make it happen. We can do it together. I love this country. I believe in America. I believe in you. We together can make America the great hope of the Earth it's always been. Thank you so very much! We sure love you guys! Thank you! What a welcome! What a sendoff! Thank you! [applause]

Remarks at a Campaign Event in Reno, Nevada

October 24, 2012

[cheers and applause]
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you. What a — what a great Reno welcome. Thank you so much. [cheers and applause] Wow. Thank you. And thank you to Governor Krolicki for introducing me here, a great lieutenant governor and a terrific friend over many years. [cheers and applause] And thank you also to — Lorrie Morgan for entertaining us today. She is a great talent and a wonderful friend. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Now, I'm not sure whether you've been watching TV, but we've had a number of debates lately. Have you noticed that? [cheers and applause] Yeah, and you know, they have really propelled our campaign. We're seeing that across the country. [cheers] People are coming together. At the same time, I think in some respects they've — they've diminished the — the president's campaign because he's now been reduced to talking about, you know, Sesame Street characters and — [laughter] — word games and — and misplaced attacks on — on me. And he knows they're false, of course.
So, you know, with — with four — four debates behind us, including the vice presidential debate, the president's been unable to find an — an agenda and to communicate an agenda and to defend an agenda. And that's one reason why I think we all know that he's out of ideas and out of excuses. And in November, you're going to put him out of office. [cheers and applause]
Now, this is a defining election. A lot of elections are important, but this, I believe, is a defining election. I say that because I think the choice that you make here in Nevada, and perhaps right here in Reno, will — will make a difference for the nation, will — will make a difference for the families of the nation and will make a difference for your family individually and specifically.
And — and let me just give you some thoughts in that regard. Here's the kind of difference it'll make. If you're a senior, or if — or if — if you're a — a caregiver for a senior — you're — you're a — a daughter or a son of a senior and you're caring for them — and if they develop a — an illness of some kind and they need to see a medical specialist, and you or they call on the phone to the specialists in Reno or one of the — the — the several that are here, and — and you ask for an appointment, and then you might hear this. You might hear the receptionist say, I'm sorry; we're not taking any more Medicare patients.
And so then you call the other medical specialist in town, and they say the same thing: I'm sorry; we're not taking any more — any more Medicare patients. And — and the reason, they'll explain, is because with the "Obamacare" cuts of $716 billion — [booing] — reducing the reimbursement for the doctors and for providers of all kinds, why, some 50 percent of doctors in America that have been polled have said they're not going to take more Medicare patients.
The idea that the president would cut Medicare for current — for current seniors in order to pay for his — you know, his legacy, "Obamacare," is something which I don't think the American people understand the impact on them and their families. And that's one reason why I'm convinced the people of America will elect me to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with real health care reform. [cheers and applause]
Now, let's say — let's say you're not a senior, or you don't have a senior that you're helping care for. And you're perhaps in your 40s or your — your 50s. And you've always recognized that these would be the most productive years in your — in your life. These would be the times that — that you'd have a best job and be able to put some money away for retirement and perhaps also be able to help pay for some of your kids' college education.
Or — or perhaps you just got a home and you're expecting that the value of the home will grow, and it'll be worth more than you retire than — yeah, that used to be the case, right? [laughter] And — and — and so you're — you're thinking about these as being the — the most productive years.
And yet you're finding that's not the case. The value of your home is not going up. You're not able to put anything away. You're barely able to make ends meet.
I — I was just a few days ago speaking with a — a man. As I recall, he was in his 50s. And he said that the job he used to have was at $25 an hour plus benefits. But the job he has now is $9 an hour without benefits. And he said, you know, I'm showing up on the employment rolls, but my life has changed dramatically.
And we've seen this across the entire country, and that's in part because the president doesn't understand what it takes to get this economy going. He doesn't have a plan to get jobs for Americans. I do, and that's why I'm going to win. [cheers and applause]
You see, for — for that man — for that man I spoke with — for that man I spoke with, he has to be somewhat puzzled by the president's campaign slogan of "forward" — [laughter] — because it doesn't feel like forward to him. It doesn't feel like forward to 23 million Americans struggling to get a good job. It doesn't feel like forward to the millions of people who don't have as good a job as they had a few years ago. It doesn't feel like forward; it feels like backward. We're going to take back the White House and get this country on the right track, (providing ?) for the American people. [cheers and applause]
Let me tell you how else this might affect — might affect your family, how this choice that you're making will make a difference in your family.
You might have a daughter graduating from — from college this — this spring. And she's going to come out, and she's going to probably have 10(,000 dollars) or $20,000 in — in student loans to pay back. And she's going to be paying the interest on that for a long, long time.
But in addition to those loans, there's something else she has: about $50,000 per person in America in debt. And so when she gets her first paycheck and she sees the deductions for taxes, some of those taxes are going to pay for that debt and for things she didn't get, for things that our generation took upon ourselves. And she's going to be paying for that all of her life. And so the American dream she had been told about by — by you, her parents, that American dream is going to be out of reach. How can she get a mortgage when she's paying back student debt and paying back $50,000 in debt to the government?
And the president's plan — more spending, more borrowing. If he's re-elected, we're going to have $20 trillion in debt by the end of his term. [boos] I will get America to finally be on track to a balanced budget — [cheers and applause] — and make sure that young lady has a bright future.
You might — yours might be a family with young ones going to — going to elementary school or perhaps middle school or high school, and — and you might look at your school and say, you know what, I'm concerned that my kids aren't getting the kind of education they need to be able to perform in — in — in the workplace of tomorrow and to have a bright and prosperous future, and — and I'm looking around for a better education opportunity for them, maybe a cyberschool or a — or a charter school, or maybe just a different school I could go to; I'd like to have that choice, but — but the dollars aren't following my child. They stay with the school, and so I don't have that choice. You see, the — the teachers union doesn't like the kind of choice that — that a lot of parents would like.
And — and — and the teachers union, of course, is there, but — but the PTA doesn't have a union, and — and the parents don't have a union, and the kids don't have a union.
The president gets the largest contributions from the teachers unions. I — I'm going to make sure that instead of being their voice, I'm going to be the voice of the parents and the kids and the teachers. [cheers and applause]
This — this election — this election is a defining — is a defining election. It's a defining election not just about big things that are being spoken about in political circles but in the most important things that happen in the American home. This election is about your family and families across this country. And the choice we make will have an enormous impact on your family.
I mean, I went through those circumstances, describing seniors and — and people in their 40s and 50s looking for a better job and — and kids coming out of college that can't find work and — and young kids where you're worried about their future. How many here identify with stories like that in your own home? [cheers and applause]
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah!
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah. Yeah. This is — this is an election about your family and about the families of America. And I understand what it's going to take to get this country strong again and to provide the answers that your families need, because this is an election about two very different pathways for America. The one represented by the president is in fact one with $20 trillion in debt. He started with 10 trillion (dollars). He's up to 16 (trillion dollars), on his way to — to 20 (trillion dollars). I'll balance the budget instead.
If he's re-elected — [cheers and applause] — if he's — if he's re-elected, you're going to see "Obamacare" installed and, with it, $716 billion in cuts to Medicare. [boos] If I'm elected — no, when I'm elected — [cheers and applause] — we're going to — we're going to — we're going to replace "Obamacare," and we're going to take that $716 billion and put it back in Medicare where it belongs.
[cheers and applause] If he's re-elected, I'm convinced you're going to see the values of your homes continue to bump along in the basement. And you're going to find it hard to get a mortgage as well; because of his Dodd-Frank, it makes it very hard for people to qualify for mortgages. If I'm — if I'm elected, when I'm elected, we're going to do this: We're going to finally get this housing market going and get jobs again — [cheers and applause] — get this economy growing, get the value of your home up. [cheers and applause]
Under President — under President Obama, you — you really don't have a jobs plan. I mean, think of this: We've had four debates, and he hasn't been able to describe what his plan is to get this economy going.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right.
MR. ROMNEY: He hasn't been able to defend it to the American people. I — I know that — I know he's got a lot of discussion — he's trying to talk to people about it. But you know, you can boil what he's saying down to four simple words, and — and — and that is, more of the same. And we don't want more of the same. (Chorus of noes.) We — we can't afford four more years like the last four years. (Chorus of noes.)
That's why we — Paul Ryan and I have a plan with five simple steps. These steps are going to get America's economy just cooking again. [cheers and applause] Number one, we're going to take full advantage of our oil, our coal, our natural gas, our renewables, our nuclear. [cheers and applause] Number two — oh, these guys like it back there. You hear that? Yeah. [cheers and applause]
Number two, we're going to take advantage of trade. It's good to trade with other nations because we're a productive society. We can trade effectively and compete with anyone in the world, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities to compete there — Latin America's economy is almost as large as that of China. We have a huge opportunity there. But you know what?
If nations don't play by the rules, we're going to have to hold them accountable, and I will hold China accountable for not playing by the rules. [cheers and applause]
Number three, we're going — we're going to have training programs that work for our workers to give them the skills they need. And we're going to finally fix our schools.
And number four, I said — I said this about our — about our budget, and that is, you know, you're not going to get entrepreneurs to start a business or big companies to come to Nevada or any other American state to build a big enterprise and hire people if they think we're on the road to Greece. And the kind of spending we're doing right now is exactly what Greece did years ago. We're on that road. I'll get us off that road. I'll put us on the road to a balanced budget. [cheers and applause]
And number five — and number five, I will be a champion of small business. I want to help small business — [cheers and applause] — grow and thrive. Small businesses, where some two-thirds of the jobs come from in this country, I want to get small business going again. And that means I want to keep taxes down on small business. I want to get regulators to see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. I'll make small business the centerpiece of our economic recovery. [cheers and applause]
And by the way — (cheers and applause continuing) — and by the way — and by the way, if you're one of those people that works for one of those small businesses or works in one or you're one of those that's starting a small business, I recognize that when it's successful and growing, you did build that. [cheers and applause]
So the Obama campaign is slipping and shrinking. [cheers and applause] The president can't seem to find an agenda to help America's families.
Our campaign is a growing movement across this country where people recognize we're going to bring — build a brighter future for the American family, for every family in this great country. We're coming together with more power, more energy.
I'm counting on you. [cheers and applause] You guys here, I need you to vote. Early voting has begun. I need you to vote. I need you to get your neighbors to vote. I need you to find one person who voted for Barack Obama last time and get them to come out and vote for us this time — [cheers and applause] — because we're — because we're coming back. This country is going to come back. You're going to see this economy come back in a major way.
And I — and I know that because I've had the chance to see the American people. All my people, I've — I've grown with a — an optimism in our future because of the character of the American heart. I've seen great qualities of the human spirit in Americans ever since I've been a young guy.
I remember some years ago I was at a Boy Scout Court of Honor. [cheers and applause] And — some scouters here? And — and I was — I was one of the leaders in the Boy Scouts, so I was in the front of the room. And we had a big Formica table, and I was at the end next to this flag on a flagpole there.
And — and so I — I was listening to a — the speaker. He was a Boy Scout — (audio break) — wanted to have a very special flag. So they bought an American flag, gold tassels around it and so forth. And they had it flown above the Capitol Dome.
And then when it came home, they — they decided they wanted it to go up on the Space Shuttle to make it even more special. And they contacted NASA and said, would you take our flag on the Space Shuttle. Now, my guess is the — that space in space comes at a premium, you know? [laughter] But — but NASA said, OK, we'll — we'll take it. We'll take this souvenir of the boys and take it on our Space Shuttle. And he said, you can imagine how proud these — these kids were in their home rooms at school watching TV as they saw the — the Space Shuttle launch. And then they saw it explode on the TV screen.
(Murmurs.) And he — he said he contacted NASA a couple of weeks later and said, have you found any remnant of our flag? And they hadn't. And he said he called every week for several months, calling and calling. And always, the response was the same: We found — we found nothing.
And then he was reading — I think it was in September, he said, many months later, an article in the paper about the debris from the Challenger disaster. And there was a mention of a flag in that article. And so he contacted NASA again and said, have you found our flag? And they said, actually, we have a presentation to make to you. And so NASA came and met with the Boy Scouts and presented them with this plastic container. And he said, we open it up, and inside was our flag, in perfect condition. [cheers and applause] And — and he said, that's it on the flagpole next to Mr. Romney. And I — and I — I reached over and grabbed the flag and held it out. And it was as if electricity was running through my arm —
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Oh!
MR. ROMNEY: — as I thought about the — the sacrifice of those patriots, those NASA astronauts, their willingness to put themselves in harm's way — (scattered applause) — for learning, for — for us.
That's the — it's the nature of the — of the American heart for people to live for something bigger than themself, to give themself to something bigger than themself. [cheers and applause] I think — I think of our — of our young people coming out of school, whether it's high school or college, that decide to put aside a career and — and enlist in the military so they can serve their country. [cheers and applause] I — would — would all those that are veterans or — or members of armed forces please raise your hand and be recognized.
[cheers and applause] Thank you.
I love our — I love our men and women who serve in our military. And I — and I believe very deeply in the truth of the words that are sung in that national hymn of ours, "America the Beautiful," the verse that says, "Oh beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country and mercy more than life." [applause] Thank you, men and women of our armed forces and our veterans — [cheers and applause] — living for something bigger than themselves.
I think — I think of a single mom right now, raising a child or two or three, that is scrimping herself — for herself so she can put a good meal on the table for her children. I think of the dad who's got a couple of jobs — working two jobs right now so he can afford to buy clothes for his kids that don't make his kids stand out at school. I think of the mom and dad who this Christmas have decided not to exchange gifts because they want to make sure to have enough for their kids to have a good Christmas.
This is — this is who we are. We're a nation that gives of ourselves to things that we love that are greater than us — our families, our faith, the future of our country. We are a patriotic people. We live for large things and we give to large things. [cheers and applause]
And so — and so Nevada — Nevada and Reno and the whole country have a choice to make. It's a choice to make about what we're going to give ourselves to. Whether we're going to be able to provide a great future to our children and to their children. It's a choice about how our families will be affected by the future. I will do everything in my power to keep America strong with strong families, a strong economy that can provide for families, a strong military, second to none in the world. [cheers and applause]
I make that commitment to you, and I need your commitment to me to get out and vote, to get your friends to get out and vote, to make sure that on November 6th, we take America in a new direction that's right for America's families. [cheers and applause]
Thank you so very much. Thank you! Thank you, guys. Thank you. [cheers and applause]

Remarks on the Economy in Ames, Iowa

October 26, 2012

Thank you all. It's great to be back in Iowa. And don't think that this is the last time you are going to see Paul Ryan and me, because you Iowans may well be the ones who decide what kind of America we will have, what kind of life our families will have.
The choice you make this November will shape great things, historic things, and those things will determine the most intimate and important aspects of every American life and every American family. This is an election about America, and it is an election about the American family.
All elections matter. This one matters a great deal. Over the years of our nation's history, choices our fellow citizens have made have changed the country's course--they were turning points of defining consequence.
We are at a turning point today. Our national debt and liabilities threaten to crush our future, our economy struggles under the weight of government and fails to create essential growth and employment.
At the same time, emerging powers seek to shape the world in their image--China with its model of authoritarianism and, in a very different way, Jihadists with Sharia, repression, and terror for the world.
This is an election of consequence. Our campaign is about big things, because we happen to believe that America faces big challenges. We recognize this is a year with a big choice, and the American people want to see big changes. And together we can bring real change to this country.
Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times. Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest--from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false.
The President's campaign falls far short of the magnitude of the times. And the presidency of the last four years has fallen far short of the promises of his last campaign. Four years ago, America voted for a post-partisan president, but they have seen the most political of presidents, and a Washington in gridlock because of it.
President Obama promised to bring us together, but at every turn, he has sought to divide and demonize. He promised to cut the deficit in half, but he doubled it. And his budget? It failed to win a single vote, Republican or Democrat, in either the House or the Senate. He said he would reform Medicare and Social Security and save them from pending insolvency, but he shrunk from proposing any solution at all.
And then, where are the jobs? Where are the 9 million more jobs that President Obama promised his stimulus would have created by now? They are in China, Mexico, and Canada and in countries that have made themselves more attractive for entrepreneurs and business and investment, even as President Obama's policies have made it less attractive for them here.
And so today, his campaign tries to deflect and detract, to minimize the failures, and to make this election about small shiny objects.
But this election matters more than that. It matters to your family.
It matters to the senior who needs to get an appointment with a medical specialist but is told by one receptionist after another that the doctor isn't taking any new Medicare patients, because Medicare has been slashed to pay for Obamacare.
It matters to the man from Waukesha, Wisconsin I spoke with several days ago. In what were supposed to be his best work years, he used to have a job at $25 an hour with benefits and now has one at $8 an hour, without benefits.
It matters to the college student, graduating this spring, with 10 to 20 thousand dollars in student debt, who now learns that she also will be paying for 50 thousand dollars in government debt, a burden that will put the American Dream beyond her reach.
It matters for the child in a failing school, unable to go to the school of his parent's choosing, because the teacher's union that funds the President's campaign opposes school choice.
The President's campaign has a slogan: it is "forward." But to the 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job, these last four years feel a lot more like "backward." We cannot afford four more years like the last four years.
This election is about big things--like the education of our children, the value of our homes, the take home pay from our jobs, the price of the gasoline we buy, and the choices we have in our healthcare. It is also about the big things that determine these things--like the growth of the economy, the strength of our military, our dependence on foreign oil, and America's leadership in the world.
President Obama frequently reminds us that he inherited a troubled economy. But a troubled economy is not all that President Obama inherited. He inherited the greatest nation in the history of the earth. He inherited the most productive and innovative nation in history. He inherited the largest economy in the world. And he inherited a people who have always risen to the occasion, regardless of the challenges they faced, so long as we have been led by men and women who have brought us together, called on our patriotism, and guided the nation with vision and conviction.
Despite all that he inherited, President Obama did not repair our economy, he did not save Medicare and Social Security, he did not tame the spending and borrowing, he did not reach across the aisle to bring us together. Nor did he stand up to China's trade practices, or deliver on his promise to re-make our relations with the Muslim world, where anti-American extremism is on the rise.
What he inherited wasn't the only problem; what he did with what he inherited made the problem worse.
In just four short years, he borrowed nearly $6 trillion, adding almost as much debt held by the public as all prior American presidents in history.
He forced through Obamacare, frightening small business from hiring new employees and adding thousands of dollars to every family's healthcare bill.
He launched an onslaught of new regulations, often to the delight of the biggest banks and corporations, but to the detriment of the small, growing businesses that create two-thirds of our jobs.
New business starts are at a 30-year low because entrepreneurs and investors are sitting on the sidelines, weary from the President's staggering new regulations and proposed massive tax increases.
Many families can't get mortgages and many entrepreneurs can't get loans because of Dodd-Frank regulations that make it harder for banks to lend.
The president invested taxpayer money--your money--in green companies, now failed, that met his fancy, and sometimes were owned by his largest campaign contributors. He spent billions of taxpayer dollars on investments like Solyndra, Tesla, Fisker, and Ener1, which only added to our mounting federal debt.
Energy prices are up in part because energy production on federal lands is down. He rejected the Keystone Pipeline from Canada, and cut in half drilling permits and leases, even as gasoline prices soared to new highs.
No, the problem with the Obama economy is not what he inherited; it is with the misguided policies that slowed the recovery, and caused millions of Americans to endure lengthy unemployment and poverty. That is why 15 million more of our fellow citizens are on food stamps than when President Obama was sworn into office. That is why 3 million more women are now living in poverty. That is why nearly 1 in 6 Americans today is poor. That is why the economy is stagnant.
Today, we received the latest round of discouraging economic news: Last quarter, our economy grew at just 2%. After the stimulus was passed, the White House promised the economy would now be growing at 4.3%, over twice as fast. Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take home pay. This is what four years of President Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change--for growth, for jobs, for more take home pay.
We have had four presidential and vice-presidential debates. And there is nothing in what the President proposed or defended that has any prospect of meeting the challenges of the times. Raising taxes will not grow jobs or ignite the economy--in fact, his tax plan has been calculated to destroy 700,000 jobs. A new stimulus, three years after the recession officially ended, may spare government, but it will not stimulate the private sector any better than did the stimulus of four years ago. And cutting one trillion dollars from the military will kill jobs and devastate our national defense.
This is not the time to double down on the trickle-down government policies that have failed us; it is time for new bold changes that measure up to the moment, that can bring America's families the certainty that the future will be better than the past.
If Paul Ryan and I are elected as your president and vice president, we will endeavor with all our hearts and energy to restore America. Instead of more spending, more borrowing from China and higher taxes from Washington, we'll renew our faith in the power of free people pursuing their dreams. We'll start with our plan for a stronger middle class, which has five elements:
One, we will act to put America on track to a balanced budget by eliminating unnecessary programs, by sending programs back to states where they can be managed with less abuse and less cost, and by shrinking the bureaucracy of Washington.
Two, we'll produce more of the energy we need to heat our homes, fill our cars, and make our economy grow. We will stop the Obama war on coal, the disdain for oil, and the effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it. We will support nuclear and renewables, but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet. And rather than investing in new electric auto and solar companies, we will invest in energy science and research to make discoveries that can actually change our energy world. And by 2020, we will achieve North American energy independence.
Three, we will make trade work for America. We'll open more markets to American agriculture, products, and services. And we will finally hold accountable any nation that doesn't play by the rules. I will stand up for the rights and interests of American workers and employers.
Four, we will grow jobs by making America the best possible place for job creators, for entrepreneurs, for small business, for innovators, for manufacturers. This we will do by updating and reshaping regulations to encourage growth, by lowering tax rates while lowering deductions and closing loopholes, and by making it clear from day one that unlike the current administration, we actually like business and the jobs business creates.
Finally, as we create more opportunity, we also will make sure that our citizens have the skills to succeed. Training programs will be shaped by the states where people live, and schools will put the interests of our kids, their parents, and their teachers above the interests of the teachers' unions.
If we do those five things, our economy will come roaring back. We will create 12 million new jobs in just four years, raise take-home pay, and get the American economy growing at four percent a year—more than double this year's rate. After all the false promises of recovery and all the waiting, we will finally see help for America's middle class.
Paul and I won't stop there. When we take office, we will take responsibility to solve the big problems that everyone agrees can't wait any longer.
We will save and secure Medicare and Social Security, both for current and near retirees, and for the generation to come. We will restore the $716 billion President Obama has taken from Medicare to pay for his vaunted Obamacare.
We will reform healthcare to tame the growth in its cost, to provide for those with pre-existing conditions, and to assure that every American has access to healthcare. We will replace government choice with consumer choice, bringing the dynamics of the marketplace to a sector of our lives that has long been dominated by government.
These things among others we can only do if we work tirelessly to bridge the divide between the political parties. We will meet with Democrat and Republican leadership regularly, we will look for common ground and shared principles, and we will put the interests of the American people above the interests of the politicians.
I know something about leading because I've led before. In business, at the Olympics, and in Massachusetts, I've brought people together to achieve real change.
I was elected as a Republican governor in a state with a legislature that was 85% Democrat. We were looking at a multi-billion dollar budget gap. But instead of fighting with one another, we came together to solve our problems. We actually cut spending--reduced it. We lowered taxes 19 times. We defended school choice. And we worked to make our state business friendly.
Our state moved up 20 places in job growth. Our schools were ranked number one in the nation. And we turned a $3 billion budget deficit into a $2 billion rainy day fund.
I know it because I have seen it: Good Democrats can come together with good Republicans to solve big problems. What we need is leadership.
America is ready for that kind of leadership. Paul Ryan and I will provide it. Our plan for a stronger middle class will create jobs, stop the decline in take home pay, and put America back on the path of prosperity and opportunity. And this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility as the leader of the free world, to promote the principles of peace. We will help the Muslim world combat the spread of extremism; we will dissuade Iran from building a nuclear bomb; we will build enduring relationships throughout Latin America; and we will partner with China and other great nations to build a more stable and peaceful world.
We face big challenges. But we also have big opportunities. New doors are open for us to sell our ideas and our products to the entire world. New technologies offer the promise of unbounded information and limitless innovation. New ideas are changing lives and hearts in diverse nations and among diverse peoples. If we seize the moment and rise to the occasion, the century ahead will be an American Century.
Our children will graduate into jobs that are waiting for them. Our seniors will be confident that their retirement is secure. Our men and women will have good jobs and good pay and good benefits. And we will have every confidence that our lives are safe, and that our livelihoods are secure.
What this requires is change, change from the course of the last four years. It requires that we put aside the small and the petty, and demand the scale of change we deserve: we need real change, big change.
Our campaign is about that kind of change--confronting the problems that politicians have avoided for over a decade, revitalizing our competitive economy, modernizing our education, restoring our founding principles.
This is the kind of change that promises a better future, one shaped by men and women pursuing their dreams in their own unique ways.
This election is a choice between the status quo -- going forward with the same policies of the last four years -- or instead, choosing real change, change that offers promise, promise that the future will be better than the past.
If you are ready for that kind of change, if you want this to be a turning point in America's course, join Paul Ryan and me, get your family and friends to join us, and vote now for the kind of leadership that these times demand.
God bless you. And God bless America.

Remarks in West Allis, Wisconsin: "Real Change From Day One"

November 2, 2012

Thank you. It's good to be in the home state of the next Vice President of the United States.
Next to Ann Romney, Paul Ryan is the best choice I ever made.
Tonight, we enter the final weekend of the campaign. At Obama rallies, they are saying "Four More Years." We are shouting "Four More Days."
We are so very grateful to you and to people across the country, for all that you have given of yourselves to this campaign. This is not just about Paul and me--it is about America, and the future we will leave to our children. We thank you, and we ask you to stay at it all the way — all the way to victory on Tuesday night.
The closing hours of a campaign have a dynamic of their own. Many voters have known for some time who they will vote for. Others are just now putting aside the demands of daily life and considering how their vote will affect their life, the lives of their children, and the course of the country we love.
We ask you to look beyond the speeches and the attacks and the ads. Look to the record, the accomplishments and failures, and the judgment. Words are cheap. A record is real and earned with effort. Change cannot be measured in speeches; it is measured in achievements.
Four years ago, candidate Obama promised to do so very much, but he has fallen so very short.
He promised to be a "post-partisan president" but he became the most partisan-- blaming, attacking, dividing.
He was going to focus on creating jobs. Instead, he focused on Obamacare, which killed jobs.
He said he was going to cut the federal deficit by half; then he doubled it.
He said that the unemployment rate would now be 5.2%; today we learned that it is 7.9%--it is 9 million jobs short of what he promised. Unemployment is higher today than when Barack Obama took office.
He promised that he would propose a plan to save Social Security and Medicare from insolvency. He did not; rather, he raided $716 billion from Medicare for his vaunted Obamacare.
He would lower health premiums by $2,500. Now they are higher by $3,000. And gasoline? The American family pays $2,000 a year more for gasoline today than when he was elected.
He said he would work across the aisle on the most important issues. He has not met on the economy, or on the budget, or on jobs, with either the Republican leader of the House or the Senate since July. Instead of bridging the divide, he has made it wider.
How is it that he has fallen so short of what he promised? In part, it is because he has never led, never worked across the aisle, never truly understood how jobs are created in the economy.
And today, he makes new promises, promises he will be unable to keep, because he admits that he will stay on the same path. The same course we have been on will not lead to a better destination.
The same path means $20 trillion in debt, crippling unemployment, stagnant take-home pay, depressed home values, and a devastated military. And unless we change course, we may be looking at another recession.
The question of this election comes down to this: do you want more of the same or do you want real change?
President Obama promised change, but he could not deliver it. I promise change, and I have a record of achieving it.
I built a business, and turned around another. I helped put an Olympics back on track. And with a Democratic legislature, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus, from job losses to job growth, and from higher taxes to higher take-home pay.
This is why I am running for president. I know how to change the course the nation is on, how to get us to a balanced budget and how to build jobs and rising take-home pay. Accomplishing real change is not something I just talk about--it is something I have done. And it is what will do when I am President of the United States.
If you believe we can do better, if you believe America should be on a better course, if you are tired of being tired, then I ask you to vote for real change. Paul Ryan and I will bring real change to America, from Day One.
When I am elected, the economy and American jobs will still be stagnant. I won't waste any time complaining about my predecessor. I won't spend my effort trying to pass partisan legislation unrelated to economic growth. From Day One, I will go to work to help Americans get back to work.
People across the country are responding to our five-part plan to create jobs.
Part one is about taking full advantage of our energy resources. On Day One, I will act to increase the number of leases and permits to drill on federal lands. I will act to speed the approval of the Keystone pipeline from Canada. I will re-visit coal regulations that were designed by the administration to strangle the industry. On Day One, we will be closer to energy independence.
Second, I will move to boost trade, especially with Latin America. I will ask Congress for Trade Promotion Authority, a power every president has used or requested since it was first created in 1974, with the exception of President Obama. And I will finally designate China as a currency manipulator. It is time for trade that works for America.
Third, I will send to Congress the Retraining Reform Act, to make sure that every worker who feels left behind in this economy can get the skills and the chance for a good-paying job.
Fourth, I will move to tackle out-of-control spending. I will send Congress the first of several fundamental reforms called the Down Payment on Fiscal Sanity Act, to immediately cut--not just slow the rate of growth-- but cut non-security discretionary spending by 5%. I'm not just going to take office on January 20th — I'm going to take responsibility for the office as well.
And fifth, I will act to boost small business, and all business. I will issue executive orders aimed straight at the problems that are holding this economy back.
The first will grant state waivers from Obamacare, to begin its repeal.
The second will launch a sweeping review of all Obama-era regulations with an eye to eliminating or repairing those that are killing jobs and small businesses.
And every entrepreneur, every small-business person, every job creator will know that for the first time in four years, the government of the United States likes business and loves the jobs and higher wages business brings to our fellow Americans.
We have almost forgotten what a real recovery looks like — what Americans can achieve when we limit government instead of limiting the dreams of our fellow Americans.
You can choose your future. You know what you need to know. You can stay on the path of the last four years, or you can choose real change.
You know that if the President is re-elected, he will still be unable to work with the people in Congress. He has ignored them, attacked them, blamed them. The debt ceiling will come up again, and shutdown and default will be threatened, chilling the economy. The President was right when he said he can't change Washington from the inside. In this case, you can take him at his word.
When I am elected, I will work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress. I will meet regularly with their leaders. I will endeavor to find those good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care more about the country than about the politics. Together, we will put the nation on track to a balanced budget, to reform our tax code, and to finally reaffirm our commitment to financial responsibility.
You know that if the President is re-elected, he will continue his war on coal and oil and natural gas. He will send billions more dollars to his favorite solar and wind companies. And all of this will guarantee higher energy prices at the pump and fewer jobs. Today, gas costs twice what it did when President Obama was elected.
When I am elected, we will change course on energy. I know just how much energy means to middle-class families. We can help hold down prices at the pump and grow new energy jobs and manufacturing jobs.
You know that if the President is re-elected, he will continue to promote government and demote business. He chose his own jobs council, made up of business leaders. And he hasn't met with them in 9 months. 9 months.
I like business, I don't see it as a necessary evil. I see it as a means for people to fulfill their dreams. Yesterday, I met Rhoda Elliott. She has been running her family restaurants for years, a business that has been in her family for 82 years. At its high point, she employed 200 people. She just closed it down telling me that regulations, taxes and the effects of the Obama economy put her out of business. She teared up--this wasn't about money, this was about a future for her family and for her family of employees. I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers like Rhoda. And I will.
You know that if the President is re-elected, he will say every good thing he can about education, but in the final analysis, he will do what his largest campaign supporters--the public-sector unions--insist upon. And your kids will have the same schools with the same results.
When I am president, I will be a voice of the children and their parents. There is no union for the PTA. I will give parents the information they need to know if their school is failing, and the choice they need to pick the school where their child can succeed.
I have watched over these last few months as our campaign has gathered the strength of a movement. It's not just the size of the crowds, it's the depth of our shared conviction ... the readiness for new possibilities ... the sense that the challenges are clear and our work will soon begin. It has made me strive even more to be worthy of the office ... to campaign as I would govern ... to speak for the aspirations of all Americans.
I learned as Governor of Massachusetts that the best achievements are shared achievements. I learned that respect and good will go a long way, and are usually returned in kind. That is how I will conduct myself as president. I will reach out to both sides of the aisle. I will bring people together, doing big things for the common good. I won't just represent one party, I'll represent one nation. I'll try to show the best of America, at a time when only our best will do.
Throughout this campaign, using every argument he can think of, President Obama has tried to convince you that, yes, these last four years have been a success. He's so sure of this that he's got one big plan for the next four years: Let's take all those ideas from the first term — the stimulus, the borrowing, Obamacare, and the rest — and go back and do them all over again.
But it could be boiled down to four words: More of the same.
I do not believe this is a moment when our big dreams will be satisfied with a small agenda. I will lead America to a better place, where confidence in the future is assured, not questioned. This is not a time to settle!
We are four days away from a fresh start. Four days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction that better days are ahead is not based on promises and hollow rhetoric but solid plans and proven results.
And an unshakeable faith in the American spirit.
If there is anyone worried the last four years are the best we can do, if there is anyone who fears that the American dream is fading away, if there is anyone who wonders whether better jobs and better paychecks are things of the past, I have a clear and unequivocal message: with the right leadership, America will come roaring back.
We are Americans. We can do anything.
The only thing that stands between us and some of the best years we have known is lack of leadership. And that's why we have elections.
This Tuesday is a moment to look into the future and imagine what we can do ... to put the past four years behind us and start building a new future.
You saw the differences when President Obama and I were side-by-side in our debates. He says it has to be this way. I say it can't stay this way. He's offering excuses, I've got a plan. He's hoping we'll settle. I can't wait for us to get started.
Americans don't settle. We build, we aspire, we listen to that voice inside that says, "We can do better." A better job; a better life for our kids; a bigger, better country.
That better life is out there, waiting for us. Our destiny is in your hands.
Four more days. Four more days and we can get to work rebuilding our country, restoring our confidence and renewing our conviction. Confidence that we are on a solid path to steady improvement. Confidence that college grads four years from now will find better jobs. Confidence that the single moms working two jobs will have a shot at a better job.
On November 6th, we come together for a better future. And on November 7th, we'll get to work. We'll reach across the street to that neighbor with the other yard sign and we'll reach across the aisle in Washington to people of good faith in the other party.
This is much more than our moment. It is America's moment of renewal and purpose and optimism. We have journeyed far and wide in this great campaign for America's future. And now we are almost home.
One final push will get us there. We have known many long days and short nights and now we are close.
The door to a brighter future is there, open, waiting for us. I need your vote, I need your help. Walk with me, walk together. Let us start anew.
God bless each of you and God bless the United States of America.

Presidential Election Concession Speech in Boston, Massachusetts

November 7, 2012

ROMNEY: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, my friends. Thank you so very much.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I have just called President Obama to congratulate him on his victory. His supporters and his campaign also deserve congratulations.
ROMNEY: His supporters and his campaign also deserve congratulations. I wish all of them well, but particularly the president, the first lady and their daughters.
(APPLAUSE)
This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation.
(APPLAUSE)
ROMNEY: I want to thank Paul Ryan for all that he has done for our campaign.
(APPLAUSE)
And for our country. Besides my wife, Ann, Paul is the best choice I've ever made.
(APPLAUSE)
And I trust that his intellect and his hard work and his commitment to principle will continue to contribute to the good of our nation.
(APPLAUSE)
I also want to thank Ann, the love of my life.
(APPLAUSE)
ROMNEY: She would have been a wonderful first lady. She's -- she has been that and more to me and to our family and to the many people that she has touched with her compassion and her care.
I thank my sons for their tireless work on behalf of the campaign, and thank their wives and children for taking up the slack as their husbands and dads have spent so many weeks away from home.
(APPLAUSE)
I want to thank Matt Rhoades and the dedicated campaign team he led.
(APPLAUSE)
They have made an extraordinary effort not just for me, but also for the country that we love.
And to you here tonight, and to the team across the country -- the volunteers, the fundraisers, the donors, the surrogates -- I don't believe that there's ever been an effort in our party that can compare with what you have done over these past years. Thank you so very much.
Thanks for all the hours of work, for the calls, for the speeches and appearances, for the resources and for the prayers. You gave deeply from yourselves and performed magnificently. And you inspired us and you humbled us. You've been the very best we could have imagined.
ROMNEY: The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing. Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work.
And we citizens also have to rise to the occasion. We look to our teachers and professors, we count on you not just to teach, but to inspire our children with a passion for learning and discovery.
We look to our pastors and priests and rabbis and counselors of all kinds to testify of the enduring principles upon which our society is built: honesty, charity, integrity and family.
We look to our parents, for in the final analysis everything depends on the success of our homes.
ROMNEY: We look to job creators of all kinds. We're counting on you to invest, to hire, to step forward.
And we look to Democrats and Republicans in government at all levels to put the people before the politics.
I believe in America. I believe in the people of America.
(APPLAUSE)
And I ran for office because I'm concerned about America. This election is over, but our principles endure. I believe that the principles upon which this nation was founded are the only sure guide to a resurgent economy and to renewed greatness.
Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign.
(APPLAUSE)
I so wish -- I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader. And so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and for this great nation.
Thank you, and God bless America. You guys are the best. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks, guys.
(APPLAUSE)
