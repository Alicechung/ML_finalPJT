0,988,"Bernie Sanders,2016,NV",Dem,0,0.0,142.5967767,Remarks at the Nevada State AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention in Las Vegas,"Brothers and sisters, thank you for inviting me to be with you today, and I want to thank all of the 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO for working hard each and every day to improve the lives of all of the American people. During my 24 years in Congress, I have been proud to stand side by side with the AFL-CIO fighting to increase the minimum wage; fighting to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right of citizenship; fighting to make it easier for workers to join unions; fighting to create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; fighting for pay equity for women workers; fighting for paid family and medical leave; fighting to expand, not cut Social Security; and fighting against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China that have destroyed millions of decent-paying jobs in America. Since the formation of our nation over 230 years ago, the trade union movement has always led the fight to improve the quality of life for all Americans, and that is what the AFL-CIO is all about. When only the wealthy were allowed to vote, the trade union movement was successful in demanding universal suffrage and a more democratic society. When tiny children were forced to work in the factories and fields, it was the trade union movement who put an end to abusive child labor and who fought for quality public education. When bosses refused to negotiate with their workers and fired them for standing up for their rights, the trade union movement pushed Congress into passing legislation which guaranteed all people the right to organize unions and collectively bargain for better wages and benefits. The list goes on. Social Security, the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, affordable housing â are just a few of the benefits that workers have won over the years thanks in large part to the trade union movement. None of those historic accomplishments would have been achieved without the work of the trade union movement. But today, all of those accomplishments are under attack by some of the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country. Brothers and sisters, the fact of the matter is that there is a war going on in this country today. And, I'm not talking about the misguided and unnecessary war we waged in Iraq. I'm not talking about the war so many of my Republican colleagues seem hell bent to wage with Iran. I'm talking about the 40-year war against the American middle class, the American standard of living, and the American dream of owning a home, sending kids to college, and having a secure retirement. What business leaders are telling us today is that if workers don't accept massive cuts in salary with no benefits, they'll move to China. They'll move to Mexico. And, the American worker can join the increasing ranks of the poor. In other words, what they are saying is to hell with the American middle class; to hell with the American dream. CEOs are rewarding themselves with outrageous compensation packages while they are squeezing everything they can out of the American worker. That is the war that is being waged against the middle class and that is what we have got to fight against! Brothers and sisters, you understand why the American people are angry because you have witnessed the decline of the middle class with your own eyes. You have seen companies receiving tax breaks for shutting down factories in this country and moving overseas. You have seen CEOs earn 300 times what their average workers make. You have seen workers fired for standing up for their rights to collectively bargain. You have seen the transformation of our country away from a General Motors economy of good wages and good benefits to a Walmart economy of starvation wages and no benefits. And, you are saying very loudly and very clearly that enough is enough! There is something profoundly wrong when the United States of America has more wealth and income inequality since 1928. There is something profoundly wrong when almost all of the new income gains generated since the Wall Street crash is flowing to the top one percent. There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. You understand better than anyone else that the real unemployment is not 5.3%. If you include people who have given up looking for work and people who are working part-time when they want to work full-time the real unemployment rate is 10.4 percent. And, here is something that is almost never discussed in the mainstream media. Youth unemployment is off the charts. Today, the average real unemployment rate of young high school graduates is 33.8 percent for white Americans, 36.1 percent for Hispanic Americans, and 51.3 percent for African-Americans. It is a national disgrace that real median family income has gone down by nearly $5,000 since 1999 and is lower today than it was 26 years ago. It is unacceptable that the typical male worker made $783 less last year than he did 42 years ago. It is unacceptable that the typical female worker made $1,337 less last year than she did in 2007. It is an international embarrassment that nearly 20 percent of kids in America are living in poverty and we have the highest childhood poverty rate of any major developed country on earth. Today, over half of American workers have less than $10,000 in savings and have no idea how they will be able to retire with any shred of dignity. Meanwhile, while the middle class is disappearing and 45 million Americans are living in poverty, the wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well and have never had it so good. Over the last two years, the wealthiest 15 people in this country â including Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, the owners of Walmart, the Koch brothers, and Sheldon Adelson â have seen an increase in their wealth of $170 billion. Today, one family, the Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans! That is the economic reality of today, and that is what we are fighting against. Brothers and sisters, fighting for the rights of working people is not just another issue for me. It's what I am all about. In my view, the trade union movement is the last line of defense against the billionaire class and the moneyed interests who are out to destroy virtually every major piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years to protect the working people of this country. Let's be clear about what we are up against. Today, as a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, is prepared to spend some $900 million this election cycle â more than either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party is likely to spend. Why? What do the Koch brothers want? Let me tell you. The Koch brothers and their billionaire allies don't just want to cut Social Security, they want to eliminate Social Security; they don't want to just cut Medicare, they want to eliminate Medicare; they don't just want to cut healthcare at the VA, they want to eliminate the Veterans Administration; they don't want to just cut the Postal Service, they want to eliminate it; they're not only opposed to increasing the minimum wage, they don't believe in the concept of the minimum wage; they don't want to just cut the estate tax, they want to abolish it. In other words, the Koch brothers and the billionaire class want it all. They want to give Americans the ""freedom"" to live in poverty working for $3 or $4 an hour without healthcare, without childcare, without a pension, without the ability to send their kids to college, and without any hope that their children will have a higher standard of living than they do. And they understand that the major obstacle standing in the way of their extreme, right wing agenda is the trade union movement. That's why they have fought so hard to eliminate unions in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and all over this country by ending collective bargaining rights. And, that's why I believe that we need to create a political revolution in this country of millions of workers, veterans, the elderly, the disabled, people of color standing together and telling the billionaire class that enough is enough! Your greed is destroying this country. You cannot have it all! You cannot continue to get tax breaks while children in this country are going hungry. This country belongs to all of us, not just to a handful of millionaires and billionaires. In my view, the American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians and the establishment media telling them that they need to be realistic; that they have got to lower their expectations; that we cannot afford to expand Social Security; that we cannot raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; that we cannot pass a major jobs program to put millions of Americans to work; that we cannot guarantee healthcare to all Americans; that it is just too impossible to end institutional racism in this country; and that the only option in the general election must be between two candidates who will support a continuation of disastrous trade policies that are destroying the middle class in this country. In my view, we have got to send a very loud and a very clear message to the establishment: You are wrong, you are dead wrong! On every one of these issues, the American people are on our side. Maybe, just maybe, it's time that the American people truly had a candidate who will stand up for their interests, not just for CEOs and billionaires on Wall Street. And, that's why I am running for president of the United States of America. Brothers and Sisters, in my view, every candidate running for president has got to answer the following questions: Why is it that, despite all of the incredible gains we have made in productivity and all of the advancements that we have been made in technology, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages while a handful of billionaires do unbelievably well? Why does it happen that most of the new jobs being created today in America are part-time, low wage jobs? How did it happen that since 2001, over 60,000 factories have shut down in America and millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs have disappeared? How does it happen that new manufacturing jobs created in this country pay in some cases half of what manufacturing jobs used to pay? Why are we in a race to the bottom with low wage countries like China, Mexico, and India? In my view, there are two fundamental reasons for this. The first has to do with our disastrous unfettered free trade policy â which literally tells corporate America â throw American workers out on the street, move to China, move to Mexico, move to Vietnam where you can pay workers pennies an hour; where you don't have to worry about the environment; where you don't need to worry about the health and safety of workers; where you don't need to have one iota of respect for human rights. During my tenure in Congress I am proud to tell you that I have voted against and helped lead the opposition to every major free trade agreement that has been passed in recent years. And, let me be clear in telling you that I will continue to lead the opposition against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade agreement in the history of our country. Brothers and sisters, the reality is that NAFTA has failed, CAFTA has failed, our membership in the World Trade Organization has failed, and perhaps, above all, Permanent Normal Trade relations with China has failed. In my view, the time is now, and it is long overdue, for the United States Congress to stand up to corporate America, to stand up to the President of the United States, to stand up to the editorial writers all over this country who year after year after year have told us how wonderful unfettered free trade is, how many new jobs would be created. The results are in. They are wrong. Unfettered free trade has been a disaster for working Americans. It has been a disaster for the middle class. And, it is high time we understood that. It is high time we ended our disastrous trade policies and began to negotiate trade policies that work not just for corporate America, not just for CEOs who make huge compensation packages, but trade policies that are fair for the working people of this country. And, that's exactly what I intend to do as president. The second fundamental reason for the decline in the middle class is that the rights of workers to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined. Today, if an employee is engaged in a union organizing campaign, that employee has a one in five chance of getting fired. Today, half of all employers threaten to close or re-locate their business if workers elect to form a union. Today, when workers become interested in forming a union, 92 percent of private-sector employers force employees to attend closed-door meetings to hear anti-union propaganda; 80 percent require supervisors to attend training sessions on how to attack unions; 78 percent require that supervisors deliver anti-union messages to workers they oversee; and 75% hire outside consultants to run anti-union campaigns. According to Human Rights Watch: ""Freedom of association is a right under severe, often buckling pressure when workers in the United States try to exercise it."" That is unacceptable! And, even when workers are faced with all of these enormous obstacles â even when these workers win union elections, more than one-third of the victories do not result in a first contract for workers. Today, corporate executives are routinely negotiating obscenely high compensation packages for themselves, but they continue to deny their own employees the ability to bargain for a better life. That is wrong. It is time to turn this around. It is time to make the Employee Free Choice Act the law of the land! If a majority of workers in a bargaining unit sign valid authorization cards stating that they want a union as their bargaining representative, they must have the right to a union. Period! One of the very first bills that I introduced when I was elected to Congress in 1991 was a card check bill. And, I will tell you that if I am elected President, making it easier for workers to form a union will be one of the very first things that I do in the White House. Today, tens of millions of workers would join a union right now if they had the chance. Yet, only 11 percent of the workforce has a union. That is unacceptable and that has got to change! Brothers and Sisters, if we are serious about strengthening America's middle class, we have got to restore workers' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits, and safer working conditions. Why do we need to do that? Because we know that union workers earn 30 percent more money, on average, than non-union workers. If you want to make more money to support your family, you need a union! We know that 79 percent of union workers have a defined benefit pension plan that guarantees income in retirement, while only 16 percent of non-union workers do. If you want to have a secure retirement, you need a union! We know that 83 percent of union workers have paid sick leave, while only 62 percent of non-union workers do. If you want to make sure that you can take time off from work when you or your child is sick, you need a union! And, if I am elected as the next president, that's exactly what I will fight to do. And, that's not all. We have got to acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage â which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years. The benchmark of full time work in America should be simple and concrete â that no full-time worker should live in poverty. And a living wage should not only be fair, it should be equitable. That is why we must establish pay equity for women workers by law. It's unconscionable that women earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men. Further, the United States must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth, the only one, which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave, paid sick time and paid vacation time. Last place is no place for America. That is why I will fight for 12 weeks of paid family leave, at least 10 days of paid vacation time and seven days of paid sick time. My Republican colleagues talk a lot about ""family values."" Well, let me be very clear. It is not a family value to force the mother of a newborn baby to go back to work a few days after she gives birth, because she doesn't have the money to stay home and bond with her baby. That is not a family value. That is an insult to everything that I know about what family is about. Today, as a result of the collapse of our middle class and declining wages, the American people are working longer hours than the people of any other country â 54 hours a year more than Japanese workers, 119 more hours per year than British workers, 299 hours more than French workers, and 425 hours more than German workers. Over 100 ago, workers in this country marched in protest for a 40 hour work week. Well, one hundred years later we still have not achieved that. Incredibly, today, 85% of working men and 66% of working women work more than 40 hours a week. And do you know what? Many workers in this country get no or very little paid vacation time. That has got to end. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs If we are serious about reversing the decline of the middle class we need a major federal jobs program that puts millions of Americans back to work at decent paying jobs. At a time when our roads, bridges, water systems, rail and airports are decaying, the most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. That's why I've introduced legislation that would invest $1 trillion over 5 years to modernize our country's physical infrastructure. This legislation would create and maintain at least 13 million good-paying jobs, while making our country more productive, efficient and safe. And I commit to you that as President, I will lead that legislation into law. Reforming Wall Street It is time to break up the largest financial institutions in the country. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments while expecting the public to bail it out. We need a banking system that is part of creating a productive economy, not a handful of huge banks on Wall Street that engage in reckless and illegal activities. If a bank is too big to fail it is too big to exist. Citizens United and Campaign Finance Reform Let me be as blunt as I can while telling you what you already know. As a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case, the American political system has been totally corrupted, and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. What the Supreme Court essentially said was that it was not good enough for the billionaire class to own much of our economy. They could now own the U.S. government as well. And that is precisely what they are trying to do. If we are serious about creating jobs, about climate change and the needs of our children, our veterans and the elderly, we must be deadly serious about campaign finance reform. That is why I will not nominate any justice to the Supreme Court who has not made it clear that he or she will move to overturn that disastrous decision which is undermining our democracy. Long term, we need to go further and establish public funding of elections, so that the dark money of American politics is stopped before democracy is bought and paid for by a handful of billionaires and corporations. American democracy is not about corporations and billionaires being able to buy candidates and elections. It is not about Wall Street and big oil or the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson spending billions of dollars to elect candidates who will make the rich richer and everyone else poorer. This is not democracy. This is oligarchy. The defining principle of American democracy is one person, one vote â with every citizen having an equal say â and no voter suppression. And that's the kind of American political system we have to fight for. College For All And when we talk about education, let me be very clear. In a highly competitive global economy, we need the best-educated workforce we can create. It is insane and counter-productive to the best interests of our country and its future, that hundreds of thousands of bright young people can not afford to go to college, and that millions of others leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades. That shortsighted path to the future must end. As President, I will fight to make tuition in public colleges and universities free, as well as substantially lower interest rates on student loans. Every person, young and old in America should be given the tools to realize their full god given potential. Health Care for All The United States remains the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care for all as a right. Despite the gains of the Affordable Care Act, 35 million Americans continue to lack health insurance and many more are under-insured. Yet, we continue paying far more per capita for health care than any other nation. The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right by moving toward a Medicare-for-All single-payer system. Protecting Our Most Vulnerable At a time when millions of Americans are struggling to keep their heads above water economically, at a time when senior poverty is increasing, at a time when millions of kids are living in dire poverty my Republican colleagues are trying to make a terrible situation even worse. If you can believe it, the Republican budget throws 27 million Americans off health insurance, makes drastic cuts in Medicare, throws millions of low income Americans, including pregnant women off nutrition programs, and makes it harder for working-class families to afford college or put their kids into Head Start. And then, to add insult to injury, they provide huge tax breaks for the very, very wealthiest families in this country while they raise taxes on working families. Well, let me tell my Republican colleagues that I respectfully disagree with their approach. Instead of cutting Social Security, we need to expand Social Security benefits. Instead of cutting head start and childcare, we need to move to a universal pre-k system for all the children of this country. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us: ""The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little."" And that is a test that we as a nation must once again meet and master. Racial Justice and Economic Opportunity The struggle for equality continues today in America, and the front line of that struggle is the inner cities throughout our nation. From Ferguson to Baltimore and across the nation, too many African Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals. If current trends continue, 1 in 4 black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. This is an unspeakable tragedy. But this crisis of over incarceration is not just a destruction of human life. It is also costly to the taxpayers who pay almost $70 Billion a year for prisons. It makes a lot more sense to me to be investing in jobs and education rather than in jails and incarceration. This issue is a crisis in American society. It is an international disgrace. That is why I have introduced legislation to spend $5.5 billion dollars to fund job-training programs for inner city youth. As a former Mayor I understand the importance of police community relations, and the need today across America to improve the climate and dialogue in those relations. Instead of building more and more prisons, we need to be building more and more meaningful lives where young people can have a future, not be stuck in a dead end with no hope or opportunity. Immigration Reform Today millions of decent, hardworking people live in America with no hope of gaining the status to live and work here legally. Many were brought here in their youth, and other came to find a life free of fear, oppression, war or deprivation. We need a rational immigration process, not the Republican alternatives of self- deportation or some other draconian non-solution. I believe in a path to citizenship, and I agree with President Obama's plans to do through executive action what the Congress reuses to do through legislation. We need to solve problems like immigration in American, not use these issues to promote division and hostility. Closing: Brothers and sisters, I believe we can restore the promise of America to every person who wants to work hard to build a future for themselves and their family. We can live in a country: Where every citizen has health care as a right, not a privilege; Where every parent can have quality and affordable childcare and where all of our qualified young people, regardless of income, can go to college; Where every senior can live in dignity and security, and not be forced to choose between their medicine and their food; Where every veteran who defends this nation gets the quality health care and benefits they have earned and receives the respect they deserve; Where the inner cities of our nation become safer, and where people who want to succeed are treated fairly and given a helping hand; Where every person who dreams of becoming a citizen has a rationale path forward, not just a dark corner to hide in; Where everyone, no matter their race, their religion, their disability or their sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality that is our birthright as Americans. That is the nation we can build together, and I look forward to working with all of you to build a future that works for all of us, and not just the few on top.

1,79,"Barack Obama,2008,DC",Dem,0,0.0,67.8120881,"Remarks at the Building Trades National Legislative Conference in Washington, DC","We meet here at a challenging time for our families and a challenging time for America. All across the country, Americans are anxious about their future. In a global economy with new rules and new risks, they've watched their government do its best to try and shift those risks onto the backs of the American worker. And they wonder how they will ever keep up. In coffee shops and town meetings, in VFW halls and right here in this room, the questions are all the same: Will I be able to leave my children a better world than I was given? Will I be able to save enough to send them to college or plan for a secure retirement? Will my job even be there tomorrow? Who will stand up for me in this new world? In this time of change and uncertainty, these questions are expected, but this isn't the first time we've heard them. These are the same kinds of questions I heard over two decades ago after I turned down a job on Wall Street and went to work as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago. The job was to help lift up neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of local steel plants. So I worked with unions and the city government to organize job-training for the jobless and hope for the hopeless, and block by block, we turned those neighborhoods around. It showed me the fundamental truth that's been at the heart of America's success - and at the heart of the labor movement in this country - the idea that we all have mutual obligations to one another, that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper, and that in this country, we rise and fall together. But we know that for the past seven and a half years, we've had a whole different philosophy in the White House. They call it the ownership society - but what it means is you're on your own. You're a worker who's been laid off from a job? Tough luck, you're on your own. You're a single mom trying to find health care for your kids? Tough luck, you're on your own. You're a senior whose pension got dumped after a lifetime of hard work? Tough luck, you're on your own. It's not just that this administration hasn't been fighting for you; they've actually tried to stop you from fighting for yourselves. This is the most anti-labor administration in our memory. They don't believe in unions. They don't believe in organizing. They've packed the labor relations board with their corporate buddies. Well, we've got news for them - it's not the Department of Management, it's the Department of Labor, and we're here to take it back. That's why I'm running for President of the United States of America. Now, John McCain seems to think the Bush years have been pretty good because he's offering more of the same. And today's a good reminder of that because it's Tax Day. This is supposed to be a day when we pay what we owe to the government. But it's become a day when George Bush's Washington rewards its friends on Wall Street. John McCain used to oppose the Bush tax cuts. He used to say that he couldn't support a tax cut where ""so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate."" He used to say that tax cuts in a time of war were a bad idea, and that they violated his ""conscience."" But somewhere along the way to the Republican nomination, I guess he figured that he had to stop speaking his mind and start towing the line - because now he wants to make those tax cuts permanent. So I respect Senator McCain. And I honor his service to this nation. But I don't think America can afford four more years of the failed Bush policies, and that's what he's offering. We need to roll back the Bush-McCain tax cuts and invest in things like health care that are really important. Instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthy who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, we should be putting a middle class tax cut into the pockets of working families. That's why I'm the only candidate in this race who's proposed a tax cut that would save our families $1,000 a year, and eliminate income taxes entirely for seniors making less than $50,000. But let me be clear - this isn't just about ending the failed policies of the Bush years; it's about ending the failed system in Washington that produces those policies. For far too long, through both Democratic and Republican administrations, Washington has allowed Wall Street to use lobbyists and campaign contributions to rig the system and get its way, no matter what it costs ordinary Americans. Think about it. The top mortgage lenders spend $185 million lobbying Congress, and we wonder why Washington looked the other way when they were tricking families into buying homes they couldn't afford. Drug and insurance companies spend $1 billion on lobbying, and we wonder why the cost of health care continues to shoot up. When George Bush put Dick Cheney in charge of energy policy, Cheney met with the environmentalist groups once, he met with the renewable energy groups once, and he met with the oil and gas companies forty times. So it's no wonder Exxon Mobile is making $11 billion a quarter when you're paying close to $4 a gallon for gas. We need a President who's thinking about not just Wall Street, but Main Street; who's not just looking to bump up a corporate bottom line, but to do what's right for the American people. Because that's the only way we're going to bring about real change - change that will make a lasting difference in the lives of ordinary Americans. I believe I can bring about that change - because I'm the only candidate in this race who's actually worked to rein in the power of lobbyists by passing historic ethics reforms in Illinois and in the U.S. Senate. And I'm the only candidate who isn't taking a dime from Washington lobbyists and PACs. They have not funded my campaign, they will not run my administration, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people, of working people, of unions when I'm President of the United States. Your voices will be heard. If you have any doubts, you can ask the union leaders in Illinois. When I was home talking to some of the local leaders there a couple of years ago, they told me they were being underbid on projects because unscrupulous builders were gaming the system. And I listened. They said that on some construction jobs, those builders were calling their employees ""independent contractors"" to get out of having to pay employment taxes and workers comp or overtime. That didn't sound right to me. So I set about leading an effort with Senator Durbin, Senator Kennedy and others in the Senate to end this practice. Because if you're doing the same work as other employees, you should have worker protections, the same ability to organize, and the same wages and benefits. And I'll fight to make that the law of the land when I'm President of the United States. We'll make sure Washington serves nobody's interests but the people's. Because I don't know about you, but I'm tired of playing defense. I'm ready to play some offense. I know the Building and Construction Trades are ready to play offense. We're ready to play offense for the minimum wage. We're ready to play offense for retirement security. We're ready to play offense for universal health care. It's time we stood up to the drug and insurance companies who've been blocking reform for too long and tell them enough is enough. I refuse to accept that in the richest nation on Earth, we have to stand by while 47 million Americans go without health insurance, and millions more are being driven to financial ruin trying to pay their medical bills. I'm tired of seeing union members having to spend all their time negotiating about the health care they already have when they should be negotiating for better wages that can support their families. We're going to change that. We're going to work with employers who are providing health care for their employees and lower premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year. And for those who don't have health care, we're going to set up a plan that's as good as the one I have as a Member of Congress. And we're not going to do it twenty years from now, or ten years from now. We're going to do it by the end of my first term as President of the United States of America. We're ready to play offense for working Americans. We need to make sure workers building America's infrastructure are making the prevailing wage and getting the benefits they deserve. After Katrina, George Bush suspended Davis-Bacon. Families had nothing left. Whole communities had been destroyed. But George Bush thought people didn't deserve to make 9 or 10 bucks an hour to rebuild that city. And John McCain isn't much different. He seems to think Davis-Bacon is something that comes from a pig farm. He's opposed it time and time again. That's wrong. We need to strengthen Davis-Bacon, and make sure any new infrastructure projects we're proposing adhere to Davis-Bacon standards. And that's what I'll do when I'm President of the United States of America. But it's not enough to make sure we're paying workers fair wages and benefits. We need to make sure the government uses project labor agreements to encourage completion of projects on time and on budget. One of the first things George Bush did when he got into office was to ban PLAs. That's bad for workers and bad for America, and that's why one of the first things I'll do as President will be to repeal that ban and put PLAs back into place. It's time we had a President who didn't choke saying the word ""union."" It's time we had a Democratic nominee who didn't choke saying the word ""union."" We need to strengthen our unions by letting them do what they do best - organize our workers. If a majority of workers want a union, they should get a union. And that is why I'll fight for and why I intend to sign the Employee Free Choice Act when it lands on my desk in the White House. Here's what else we'll do - we'll put Americans back to work. I applaud your partnership with Helmets-to-Hardhats. I believe we have a responsibility to serve our soldiers as well as they're serving us, and by helping make sure they have the skills to work in the trades when they come home, you're living up to that responsibility. As President, I'll support funding for this critical program. And we won't just promote job-training, we'll promote job-creation. That's why we'll pass what I'm calling the Patriot Employer Act that I've been working on since I got to the Senate - because in my administration, we're not going to give tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas; we'll give them to companies that create good jobs with decent wages here in America. We're going to invest in this country. Back in the 1950's, Americans were put to work building the Interstate Highway system and that helped expand our middle class. We need to show the same kind of leadership today. That's why I've called for a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank that will invest $60 billion over ten years and generate millions of new jobs. We can't keep standing by while our roads and bridges and airports crumble and decay. For our economy, our safety, and our workers, we have to rebuild America. Investing in America means investing in the jobs of the future. We shouldn't be sending billions of dollars to foreign nations because of our addiction to oil. We should be investing in American-made solar panels, windmills, and clean coal technology. That's why I've proposed investing $150 billion over the next ten years in the green energy sector. This will create up to five million new American jobs - and those are jobs that pay well, and can't be outsourced. That's why this will be a priority in my administration. Now, I know some will say we can't afford all this. But it seems to me - if we can spend $10 billion a month rebuilding Iraq, we can spend $15 billion a year in our own country to create jobs and strengthen the long-term competitiveness of our economy. But if we're serious about fighting for our workers here at home, we've got to fight for them around the world. Now, the truth is trade is here to stay, and that if we have strong labor and environmental protections in our agreements, and if our trading partners are playing by the rules, trade can be a good thing for our workers and our economy. But what we can't do is ignore violence against union organizers in Colombia. What we can't do is sign trade deals that put the interests of multinational corporations ahead of the interests of our workers or our environment. That's why I opposed NAFTA, and CAFTA, and that's why I'll make sure our trade agreements work for all Americans when I'm President of the United States. So make no mistake - the American people have a choice in this election. We can talk about our economic problems all we want, but unless we change the broken system in Washington, nothing else is going to change. We can talk all we want about standing up for our workers, but unless we have a President you can trust to listen and put working Americans first, nothing is really going to change. And you can trust me. Because politics didn't lead me to working folks; working folks led me to politics. I was standing with American workers on the streets of Chicago twenty years ago, and the reason I'm here today is because I don't want to wake up one day many years from now and see that our workers are still being denied the wages and benefits and rights that they deserve, or that we still haven't made the investments in infrastructure and in training our workers that we desperately need. The reason I'm here today is because I know what it's like to go to college on student loans, and see a mother get sick and worry that maybe she can't pay the bills. I know what it's like to have to scratch and work and claw to build a better life for your family. And I don't want to wake up many years from now and find that the American dream is still out of reach for too many Americans. The reason I'm here today is because I believe that if we can just put an end to the politics of division and distraction, and reclaim that sense that we all have a stake in each other, that we rise and fall as one nation; if we can just unite this country around a common purpose - black, white, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American; labor and management; Democrats, Republicans, and Independents - there's no obstacle we cannot overcome, no destiny we cannot fulfill. That's the fundamental truth I learned on the streets of Chicago. That's the idea at the heart of the Building and Construction Trades. And that's the opportunity we have in this election. There is a moment in the life of every generation where that spirit of unity and hopefulness has to come through if we're going to make our mark on history. This is our moment. This is our time. I'm proud and honored that the first union endorsement I received in this campaign was from a Building and Construction Trades union - the Plumbers and Pipefitters. And I'd be proud and honored to have all of your support. And if you will march with me, and organize with me, and if you vote for me, then I promise you this: We will not just win this Democratic Nomination, we will win the general election and then together - you and I - we're going to change this country, and we're going to change this world.

2,505,"Bill Richardson,2008,NH",Dem,0,1.0,56.8640484,Speech to the New Hampshire AFL-CIO Convention,"I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge all the hard working union members that are here with us today. Today -- American workers are more productive than ever. But their real wages are shrinking---their pensions are threatenedâand their health-care coverage is cut. Meanwhile this administration cuts student loans, hands out tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and wants to privatize social security. America's workers are the backbone of our country and I am proud to stand with you here today â¦ and I want to thank you for standing with me throughout my career. The men and women of the Labor movement are a primary reason why I have been able to accomplish so much in New Mexico. Creating more than 84,000 jobs in the last four years. Cutting one billion in taxesânot for the wealthyâbut for working families And expanding access to health insurance to working families, and today every child five years or younger has access to health care coverage. Their support helped me and the Democrats recapture state government after eight years of Republican rule. And it is only with the help of the hardworking men and women of Labor that Democrats will recapture the White House. It's through that same hard work that the people of New Hampshire have a new minimum wage---a wage with dignity. After three years working side-by-side with labor, we've been able to do the same in New Mexico. But I think we all know--raising the minimum wage is the best way to stand up for the working poor. But, we need to stand up for the middle class too. And the best way we can do that is by supporting unions. Raising state minimum wages is good, but not good enough. Raising the federal minimum wage is good, but not good enough. To renew America's middle class, we shouldn't stop until every worker's wage is a union wage. And that starts with majority authorization. That doesn't just mean giving employees a chance to form unions by signing cards authorizing union representation. That also means swiftly punishing those employers who violate any worker's right to organize. I believe the members organizations of AFL-CIO don't have to ask where I stand-- As one of my first acts as Governor, I stood with the AFSCME, CWA, AFT and restored collective bargaining rights for public employees---with card-check recognition and fair share. There are no free riders in my stateâ¦period. I stood with the American Federation of Teachersâand together we created new standards, linked them to higher teacher salaries, and our teacher salaries have moved from 46th to 29th in the nation â and our teacher quality has jumped from 30th to 17th. I stood with CWA and together we a statewide project called Wire New Mexico to create a high-speech, high capacity data, voice and video communications backbone. That network will be installed, maintained and upgraded by union workers. I stood with the theatrical and stage employees union to invest state funds to train new technicians to work on more than $1 billion dollars in film and television production over the last four years. That union has grown from 60 registered members to over 1400 and those productions are proudly stamped Made in the USA with a Union label. I stood with the New Mexico Building and Trades. When we financed the $400 million construction for a new state hospital, we negotiated the first Public Works Project Labor Agreement in New Mexico history. That 100% union project is on-time and on-budget. And in my state, I made the prevailing wage a union wage. I also worked with the Building and Trades Department to create the toughest independent contractor law in the country. In New Mexico, we require independent contractors to be licensed as a business, have a written contract and control the work. Break the lawâand you'll face a fine or spend some time in jail--a 100% union-built jail. And I stood with workers when I was President Clinton's Secretary of Energy. When I started, there was a disturbing number of staff, craftsmen, and many of your members who were sick or dyingâI call them the ""silent cold warriors."" These brave men and women had served for decades supporting the critical research and tests to guarantee America's nuclear defense. But, everyone was focused on what went into the air and water, not what was going into the bodies of our workers. First, I did what should have been done long agoâI apologized for the federal government's failure to protect these workers. Second, I worked with Congress and President Clinton to put together a nuclear worker compensation package--$150,000 dollars per worker and payment of all medical expenses. I'm proud to say, to-date, it has dispensed more than $2 billion to workers or their survivorsâtrying to right a terrible wrong. . No I sit at the head of the table but we have union representatives on every commission affecting your membership, in my cabinet, all the way up to deputy chief of staff and former head of the New Mexico Building Trades, Brian Condit. Over the years, unions and I have seen eye-to-eye a lot. As Governor I've been proud to receive the endorsement of every state labor union, the support of labor as Secretary of Energy, and in my 15 years in Congress I received an 88% rating from the AFL-CIO. I want to underscore an important point. In 1992 Unions households turned out 19% of the voteâthe entire national voteâand Governor Clinton became the first Democratic president in a dozen years. In 2000 Unions turned out 25% of the voteâand Al Gore won. In 2006 Unions turned out in force and today, we have a Democratic Congress. You've always done your part in helping Democrats. . It's now time Democrat's did ours. Labor has a seat at my Cabinet table and a voice in my administration in New Mexico. When I'm President, my Secretary of Labor will be from the ranks of organized labor. You will sit at my Cabinet table and you will be the voice of labor--in my Administration. Second, Democrats need to work to create new jobs---clean energy jobs. Let me tell you about those 84-thousand new jobs in New Mexico. We're building biodiesel and ethanol plants, electric automotive and solar manufacturing sites, and providing new incentives to construct clean coal plants. We're reducing our dependence on foreign oil, beating global warming and creating thousands of high-wage jobs. We've become the clean energy state. I want to make us the clean energy nation, and be America's first ""Energy President."" Now, another President---Bill Clinton used to send me in to negotiate the freedom of American hostages and political prisoners. He'd say ""Send Richardson, bad guys seem to like him."" And that's how I ended up negotiating face-to-face with people like Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, and the North Koreans. And every time, I brought Americans home. I think we need the same sort of strong and focused diplomacy, with friends and foes alike, in order to adapt our foreign policy to the global nature of energyâ¦the global catastrophe of global warmingâ¦and the disaster in Iraq. We have to undo the damageâ¦and the world is waiting. But, if this president's foreign policy inexperience got us into this war, then it's going to take someone with real hands-on international experience to lead us out. In the next nine months, I hope you will ask each candidate lot of questions. Listen to what promises we make, but ask us what promises we've kept. Listen to how we will unify our party, but ask us how we can unify the country. Listen to how we will withdrawal from Iraq, but ask us how we will negotiate the peace. Choose a candidate who's got the vision and experienceâto win the presidency, to unify our country, and to renew our leadership in the world. I believe I offer that vision and experience. I ask you to join me. Let's end the division and bring our country together. Let's start fighting for things that matterâaccess to health care, quality education, better jobs, and creating a clean energy economy. Let's rebuild America's middle class by supporting every workers right to organize. And because stubbornness isn't a foreign policy---Let's never be afraid to talk with our foes. And let's have the courage to end this war in Iraq and renew America's diplomacy and reputation in the world. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.","['No I sit at the head of the table but we have union representatives on every commission affecting your membership, in my cabinet, all the

3,1140,"Rick Santorum,2016,DC",Rep,0,0.0,55.848809,"Remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, DC","I am the son of an Italian immigrant. My father's journey to America rescued him from a childhood as a ""brown shirt"" and likely some cog in Mussolini's war machine. But it wasn't as easy as simply boarding a ship and coming to America for my dad. My Italian-speaking grandfather was able to come to America in order to flee this new fascist regime in 1923 in spite of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 that limited Italian immigrants to just a few thousand Italians per year. Turns out that his hometown in Italy was part of Austria before World War I, so my grandfather was considered an Austrian. He was able to come but wasn't unable to bring his Italian children with him. In 1930, he became a citizen after working most of that time in the coalmines of southwestern Pennsylvania. He was then able to unite with his family in America. When my father told me about our family's journey to America, I asked him the natural question: ""Did you resent America for keeping you away from your father and in a fascist country for the first seven years of your life?"" He said ""no, America was worth the wait."" He was right. America was worth the wait, because we have been a country that puts the law above the people making and executing that law. The greatest protection each of us has is that no one, NO ONE, in America is above the law, including presidents, judges and, yes, immigrants. The laws that kept my father and grandfather apart were passed because our nation needed to balance labor markets, national security interests, or any number of legitimate reasons for limiting an inflow of new immigrants. But the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 targeted Italians and Jews in part because of concerns about assimilation and in part because of rank prejudice. Oddly enough, the laws in place today were last significantly altered in 1990 in a bill authored by Ted Kennedy. It is nothing like the laws of the 1920s which limited immigration not just in nationality but also in number to 178,000 people per year for what turned out to be 40 years. The Kennedy bill was designed to remove the need for illegal immigration by increasing the number of legal immigrants to over a million per year. It hasn't worked. Thanks to the incentives offered by President Obama and bills like the Gang of Eight immigration proposal, last year the number of illegal immigrants rose to almost 700,000. That brings the total number of immigrants in this country to a record 42 million immigrants comprising 13.3% of the US population, the highest level in 105 years. Is this flood of immigrants in the national interest? That is question we should ask about all of our laws isn't it? Immigration laws should serve the interest of the American people. Since immigration involves labor markets one key requirement of any plan is that it improves opportunities for better jobs and better wages by stimulating growth. Let's look at the numbers. Without a doubt increased immigration has held down the cost of labor leading to higher profits for businesses, but has it caused growth that has led to higher wages, particularly for workers who these immigrants compete against for jobs? Real hourly wages have increased by about one dollar in the past 25 years and have slightly declined during this presidency. From 2000 to 2014 there were 5.7 million net new jobs created for workers aged 16-65 and all of them went to immigrants in spite of a 17 million increase in native born workers. Democrats like Hillary Clinton say they are for the American worker yet they demand amnesty and huge increases in the number of immigrants for one overriding reason, votes, which leads to political power. They have no interest in fixing our broken immigration system. The President had filibuster proof majorities in Congress his first two years in office, majorities so strong that he was able to ram through ObamaCare â yet he never even introduced an immigration reform bill. To the president and Mrs. Clinton immigration is only about dividing America by injecting ethnic and racial politics into this debate, not doing right by struggling American workers. Immigration is just another example of how Mrs. Clinton has abandoned the millions of Americans who want the opportunity to work and provide for themselves and their families by using divisive identity politics to gain more power. What I will be proposing today is in direct contrast to Hillary's vision. My proposal says to American workers of all races, genders, and ethnicities that you are welcome to an America that will provide you the opportunity to rise if you work hard and obey the law. My proposal is based on hope and opportunity, not fear and bigotry. The establishment, big business community is not much better. They see immigrant workers as a way of diluting the labor market and lowering labor costs. To them, workers are commodities and increasing the labor supply means more bottom line profitability. Workers are not commodities these are real people, with real families, who have mortgages to pay and mouths to feed, and they deserve leaders who will put them first. That is why I am here today! I am not running for President for the sake of power or profit, I am running for President to fight for real people, who have real families, and who are struggling to make ends meet. Over the past twenty years, nearly 35 million legal and illegal immigrants have come to our shores. This is the largest mass immigration America has seen in our history â even surpassing the Great Wave from the turn of the 20th Century. These immigrants are largely unskilled and low-skilled labor and they are competing for the same jobs as the 74% of Americans who do not have a college degree. Because labor supply and demand works, corporate profits are up and executives and share holders are doing well. But the American worker has seen their wages stagnant for over a decade. The American worker is struggling and as a result the American family is struggling. I know some of the establishment of my Party roll their eyes whenever I make this point. I see it when I'm in Manhattan's corporate boardrooms, Party fundraisers, and business dinners. Contrary to what the elites along the coasts think, the economy does not start on Wall Street and end at Route 128. The economy starts with the family and includes many routes and streets, including Main Street. The American family is the first economy. Just like a business, each family needs revenue, pays expenses, and at the end of the month the books must balance. As families struggle in this ever competitive labor market, we must make sure our policies do not throw up further roadblocks and dead ends to their ability to succeed. We must rebuild this first economy, and one step is to ensure we have a responsible immigration policy that puts the American worker and their families first. Up until a few days ago I was the only candidate in this race who put forward a legal and illegal immigration proposal that puts the American worker first. I wanted to use this opportunity to flesh out those proposals and cast a vision for a stronger, healthier and more prosperous America. This plan will fix our broken system that has served as a catalyst to economic stagnation, soaring government spending and lawlessness that threatens our personal and national security. I am not new to this debate. Nearly a decade ago, I authored border security legislation that stood in contrast to the legislation President Bush and Senator Kennedy advocated. Unlike some who are running for President today, I was never a member of a Senate ""gang,"" because I understood amnesty was not a solution but a perpetuation of a problem. Whether it was the path to citizenship in the Gang of Eight bill or the right to a permanent work permit supported by Ted Cruz and others, it is amnesty. Those workers who serve as grounds keepers or waiters, bartenders and maids, they are the hard-working Americans who are being hurt most by record levels of legal and illegal immigration. They are the blue collar Americans who are in direct competition with cheap, and at times illegal, immigrant labor. Amnesty will make competition more fierce, encourage more illegal immigration and further depress wages. As important as the debate over illegal immigration is, we can't just speak about securing our borders and turn a blind eye to an entire system that hurts American workers. Until this spring I was the only candidate who had a message focused on helping American workers by putting common sense limits on this surge of immigrants. Governor Walker was first to change his position and with few specifics call for limits on immigration. Now Donald Trump has joined a majority of Americans and me with some ideas on helping to put American workers first. I welcome them both and encourage all the candidates and all Americans to listen to my vision for how we make America stronger. Let's face it, the problem with illegal immigration can mostly be solved immediately because it doesn't involve changing the law, it simply requires the current laws to be enforced! The president today has the authority and the access to resources to secure our border. Let me be clear. I will do what five presidents have promised the American people. I will control our border. I will build hundreds of miles of new walls, use state of the art technology and deploy whatever manpower necessary to secure our border with Mexico. I will end the catch and release policy of this administration and have personnel deployed so as to maximize apprehensions at the border. It is time to stop the bait and switch game with the American worker. While I won't demand the government of Mexico to build the wall, I want US workers to do that, I will make it clear to the Mexican government they must stop facilitating this lawlessness on the border and cooperate with our efforts. I will do all I can to change Mexico's behavior to the benefit of both countries. However, if they fail to cooperate I am prepared to stop authorizing border crossing cards as a first step in getting their cooperation. Visa overstays is one of the largest â if not the largest â factor contributing to our illegal immigrant population. The defacto policy of this administration is to track visa entries, but not exits. I will do what no previous Administration has. I will enforce the law by implementing a biometric tracking system for every immigrant who enters America so we can track who is here and who has overstayed their visa. Anyone apprehended who has overstayed their visa should be subject to fines and then subsequently removed. I will end the practice of sanctuary cities by withholding federal funds from any city that refuses to cooperate with federal authorities. I support Kate's Law and with it ending the policy that resulted in 30,000 criminal illegal immigrants being released from prison because their native country won't accept them. I will exercise my authority to deny visas to any foreign countries that will not take responsibility for their people. The federal government has to end policies that have encouraged millions to break the law. I will put an end to president Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty which is largely responsible for the latest border surge. I will push for congressional action to require all businesses use e-verify for all employees to assure those who play by the rules are rewarded and employers who hire illegal immigrants are held accountable. I will propose we join every other developed country in the world save one, and put an end to automatic citizenship for children born here to illegal immigrants. This enforcement of, by in large, existing law will dramatically reduce the number of illegal immigrants competing against legal workers for jobs in America. However, reducing the number of illegal immigrants will not be sufficient to help struggling American workers. I am proposing two changes to the legal immigration system that will reduce the supply of lower skilled adults holding wages down in America. Like Jeb Bush I am proposing eliminating both the visa lottery and chain migration. Unlike Jeb I will not be increasing other categories. These changes will result in a 25% reduction in legal immigration. This is in stark contrast with every Republican presidential candidate except Trump who says he also wants to return to historical averages. Some like Ted Cruz have actually proposed doubling legal immigration. I believe immigration can be a very good thing. But as with anything, there can also be too much of a good thing. When our labor markets cannot manage the influx we are receiving, then it is time to recalibrate. This is not anti-immigrant, this is pro- worker, especially those who are most affected by waves of new workers â recent immigrants, minorities and younger workers. Even skilled workers have been hurt by our current system. This year Disney laid off Americans and replaced them with cheap foreign labor and Southern California Edison had the nerve to have its American workers train their foreign replacements under the H1B visa program. There is an oversupply of American workers who can fill entry level tech jobs coming out of our education system. They should be given the opportunity to get work in their chosen field, grow in experience and rise. I propose overhauling the H1-B visa program so that only the highest skilled workers who can stimulate the economy, and create more jobs here at home are eligible. Again this is in stark contrast with other Republicans particularly Ted Cruz who seeks to quintuple H1Bs. But in the same vein, there is a sector of our economy that has needs that are not currently being met by US workers â namely agriculture. Of the over 400 job classifications at the Department of Commerce, only a handful are the majority of workers in that category immigrant workers. Most are in agriculture. For illegal immigrant workers who are in these classifications, I will provide the opportunity for their employers to pay an annual fee to permit these workers to continue to work as temporary guest workers. As my father said, America is worth the wait and it is worth doing it right. This means we need an immigration policy that rewards those who do it right, an immigration policy that fits our economic needs, and an immigration policy that puts the American worker first. I was asked in the first presidential debate how I would explain the enforcement of our immigration laws to the child of an illegal immigrant. I said our compassion as a nation is found in our laws because we treat everyone equally under those laws. This must be true for our immigration laws. Having an immigration system that turns its back on American citizens and legal immigrants so that more immigrants can come to our shores at a time when there are not enough good paying jobs to meet their needs is not compassionate. What is compassionate is an immigration system that not only says we want you in America, but says we can give you the opportunity to rise and reach the American dream each and every immigrant strives to achieve.

4,1070,"Donald J. Trump,2016,NY",Rep,0,0.0,51.8703774,Remarks to the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you. Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival â it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country. My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams. Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans. Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM â today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico. It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. We are going to turn this around. My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before. We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources. Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success. Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities. All of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism â which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country â and replace it with a new policy of Americanism. Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans? If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries. Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation. My opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution â a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity. The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests. In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed. In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances. In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries. Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there. Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable â how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption? The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos â but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future. These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice. I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country. Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration. I'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States â and as your President, I will fight for every last American job. We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon. It's time to start thinking big once again. That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math. This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings. It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit. It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies. Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter â that translates to millions of lost jobs. This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs. Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty. On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt â it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion. Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure. Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce. Never has so much money been spent so poorly. But we're going to turn that all around. Here's how. It begins with bold new tax reform. As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all â in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely. By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs. In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit â it won't even be close. This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal. The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka. These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan. Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation. Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit â in the form a Childcare rebate â and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts. A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all. One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate â down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch. We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment. On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country. We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs â and that means jobs in our poorest communities. Next, comes regulations. One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy. Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry â and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to. In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars. I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books. This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills. We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work. Energy reform is central to our plan as well According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person. Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars. A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama â creating countless more jobs in the process. Finally, comes trade â the foundation for everything America's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year â an enormous drag on growth. Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent. Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country. It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted â every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality. Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000. I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps: I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators â and I know who you are, many of you are in the room. We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed. We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States. I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules. If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists. Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year. We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country. Here is how the plan adds up We are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan. Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost. That leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade â again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements. If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs. This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country. This is what our new future will look like I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall ; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA â and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first. And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation â and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American metal into the spine of this country. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. And Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
