0,478,"John Edwards,2008,IA",Dem,1,1.0,241.4460144,"Remarks in Cedar Rapids, Iowa","Good morning. It's good to be back in Iowa with all of you today. I was recently here to talk about the fundamental unfairness at the heart of our economy today and what we need to do to fix it. I focused then on our tax code and how we can reform it to honor work, not just wealth. And in the coming weeks I will address the issue of corporate responsibility. Today, I want to talk to you about one of the most important economic issues facing America - trade, especially its effect on jobs. Over the past few years, I've traveled across this country and met with so many honest, hard working Americans, including many right here in Iowa, who've been left behind by our economy. During one of my trips a couple of years ago, I met Doug Bishop. For years, Doug worked at the Maytag plant in Newton. He worked hard for Maytag day in and day out. And then Maytag decided to cut costs by cutting Doug's job. Doug was lucky. After eight months out of work, he's back on his feet now, a leader in his community. But many other people in Newton - and across America - haven't been so lucky. They're as eager to get back to work as Doug was, but they're still struggling. These people did everything our country asked of them. Everything. They had jobs, they worked hard at them, and they provided for their families - and in return, they got the rug pulled out from under them. Who was looking out for these workers in Newton? Who was looking out for their families? Not Maytag. And certainly not anyone in Washington, D.C. It hasn't always been this way. Workers for generations were at the heart of our country. Hard-working men and women have made America the strongest, most prosperous nation in the history of the world. But today, Washington has turned its back on our workers and their futures. More than ever, workers face an uncertain world where they feel like no one in Washington is doing what they can to help them. They're right. Washington isn't looking out for them. Washington is too busy looking out for big business and protecting irresponsible corporations. Trade has become a bad word for working Americans for a simple reason - our trade policies have been bad for working Americans. Washington looks at every trade deal and asks one question, and only one question - is it good for corporate profits? They don't look at what it will do to workers, to families, to wages, to jobs, or even to the economy. When it comes to trade, the only thing that matters in Washington is the big business bottom line. And most of big business is only looking out for its profits, not its people. Instead, they should be paying attention to a simple truth - corporations can be successful and responsible at the same time. We need new trade policies in America that put workers, wages and families first. Not fourth, not third, not second. First. What we need is trade without trade-offs. Trade without trade-offs for workers. Trade without trade-offs for jobs. Trade without trade-offs for the environment. We need trade without trade-offs for America. Corporations, and the executives who lead them, need to realize that creating American jobs is not only the responsible thing to do, it's the patriotic thing to do. But that's certainly not what is happening today. America is bleeding jobs. Since President Bush took office, 5 million jobs have been lost to trade, including many here in Iowa, and 15 million more jobs may move offshore within the next decade. And don't let anyone tell you it's just low-skilled jobs that we'll lose - it's also many of our country's high quality service and technology jobs - jobs that require advanced education such as in computer programming, radiology, call centers, and financial analysis. But it doesn't begin or end with just the jobs being outsourced to China, India and elsewhere. The negative effects from globalization are ripping through the economy. Globalization has helped stunt the growth in wages for American workers. Workers in America must now compete every day with workers overseas earning miserably low wages with no benefits. And what's even worse, big multinational corporations now use the excuse that they have to ship ever more good-paying American jobs overseas in order to compete with the very low wage jobs they themselves created there. In the last few years, wages have fallen for nearly every educational group, all the way up to masters degrees - and corporate profits have nearly doubled. Rather than create income gains for all, the gains from globalization are mostly flowing to the most fortunate Americans. Globalization is a major reason why income inequality is at its worst since before the Great Depression. It shouldn't be this way. And when I'm president, I'm going to tell the lobbyists pulling the strings in Washington and the big corporations that hire them the same thing - their time is over. The system is rigged against regular Americans to guarantee more power for the powerful and more wealth for the wealthy. Well, I'm going to cut the rigging down and end the game. Washington's values are all wrong, but the American people's values are exactly right. We believe in hard work, fairness and opportunity. Just like we always have. And we're going to restore those values to our economy and our government. I know the American people want change, real change. Washington isn't working for them. Our economy isn't working for them. But by uniting together, we can fix this. We can make sure that working and middle class families again have the opportunities to which they're entitled. While CEOs have been sitting in their boardrooms and while lobbyists and Washington insiders having been dining in their steakhouses, I have been on the ground. Meeting workers. Walking picket lines. I've walked past far too many manufacturing plants with locks on their gates and weeds in their yards. I've heard firsthand from workers how they're one crisis away - one pink slip, one trip to the emergency room - from going over a cliff. But I've also seen firsthand their determination to fight - for their families and for our values. We'll need courage and conviction and backbone to go up against these powerful lobbyists and insiders. Half measures and baby steps won't level the playing field. Triangulation and compromise won't fix anything. It won't be easy, but together - you and me and everyone who is sick of listening to Washington say one thing and do another - we can stand up and change this country for the better. ***** And we certainly need change, especially in our trade policies. For years now, Washington has been passing trade deal after trade deal that works great for multinational corporations, but not for working Americans. For example, NAFTA and the WTO provide unique rights for foreign companies whose profits are allegedly hurt by environmental and health regulations. These foreign companies have used them to demand compensation for laws against toxins, mad cow disease, and gambling - they have even sued the Canadian postal service for being a monopoly. Domestic companies would get laughed out of court if they tried this, but foreign investors can assert these special rights in secretive panels that operate outside our system of laws. When economists say that trade helps our economy overall, we need to be honest about the fact that it does not help everyone. The true measure of our economy isn't found only in the size of our GDP or the level of corporate profits - it's whether middle class families are doing better or worse. A sure sign that our trade and economic policies are seriously out of whack is our trade deficit. Our nation's imports have increased by a staggering 50 percent in the past 15 years, and instead of a trade balance, the United States now has the largest trade deficit in the history of the globe - and it just keeps growing. Last year, our current account deficit was more than $850 billion, which is a staggering 6.5 percent of our nation's entire GDP, and our trade deficit with China alone was $233 billion. That means that we are consuming billions of dollars more in imported goods than we produce - and we are borrowing heavily to pay for them. Behind all these numbers and statistics are the faces of millions of Americans forgotten in our trade deals. Well, I can tell you that I will never forget them. I saw what happened when the mill that my dad worked in all his life, and that I worked in myself when I was young, closed and the jobs went somewhere else. It wasn't just devastating to our community economically -- it was devastating to the pride and dignity of the people who worked hard every day trying to make a better life for their kids. Let me tell you, if a CEO thinks the right thing to do is to ship American jobs overseas, to destroy families and communities, then I challenge him to go and look those workers in the eye and have the guts to tell them to their face that they can't compete. I've stood with these workers all across America - and let me tell you, they can compete, because they are the best workers in the world. The trade policies of President Bush have devastated towns and communities all across America. But let's be clear about something - this isn't just his doing. For far too long, presidents from both parties have entered into trade agreements, agreements like NAFTA, promising that they would create millions of new jobs and enrich communities. Instead, too many of these agreements have cost us jobs and devastated many of our towns. NAFTA was written by insiders in all three countries, and it served their interests - not the interests of regular workers. It included unprecedented rights for corporate investors, but no labor or environmental protections in its core text. And over the past 15 years, we have seen growing income inequality in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Well enough is enough. Americans have paid the price long enough. We need to change our fundamental approach to trade. We need to make American values the foundation of our trade deals, and we need to put workers back at their core. ***** Let me tell you, no one is asking for any guarantees. America has the most open economy in the world, and no one is suggesting that we put up tariffs or go back to protectionism. Any politician who promises to bring back the jobs we've lost isn't telling the truth - no one can bring back those jobs. But with a level playing field, American workers can compete with anybody on earth. And I'm absolutely not suggesting an end to trade. I am calling instead for an end to lip service. Our leaders in Washington say many of the right things. They even say that they will make sure the gains from trade are shared with everyone. But when push comes to shove, the trade gets pushed forward and the sharing gets shoved off. We can and we must change this. I believe we need to follow three principles to make sure globalization works for everyone. First, trade deals must benefit workers, not just big multinational corporations. Today, our trade agreements are negotiated behind closed doors. The multinationals get their say, but when one goes to Congress it gets an up or down vote - no amendments are allowed. No wonder that corporations get unique protections, while workers don't benefit. That's wrong. Imagine trade policies that actually put American workers first. We need fair rules for workers, and we need strong protections for labor and the environment and against currency manipulation. If a deal is good for middle-class families, it's good for America; if it's not, it's not. Second, our trade policies should also lift up workers around the world. This struggle over fair trade is about more that just what's at stake for America's workers - it's also about what's at stake for workers in every country. Making sure that workers around the globe are treated fairly and share in trade gains is the right thing to do morally, it's the right thing to do economically, and it will make us much safer and more secure. That's what strong labor standards are all about. Making sure that workers have the right to organize and earn a fair wage will not only prevent a ""race to the bottom"" on labor rights - it will also help build a global middle class that shares in the gains from trade and creates markets for U.S. exports. Third, we need to address more than just our trade policies in order to restore fairness and opportunity to workers. I talked earlier about some of the adverse effects of globalization - stagnant wages and rising inequality. To help regular Americans get ahead and stay ahead, we need to make sure our children get a quality education and have the chance to go to college. We need to raise the minimum wage, strengthen unions, and help families build assets. And the most important thing we can do to provide security to our workers is to guarantee universal health care in this country. I am proud to be the first major candidate to come out with a plan for universal health care. We also need to invest resources to ensure that our country keeps its competitive edge in the world. We need to create the jobs of the future right here in America and make sure our workers have the skills they need to fill them. We need to make the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit permanent, invest in life sciences and biomedical research, strengthen math and science education, and create a new energy economy. There are so many things we can do to put our economy back on the side of the working men and women who make this country great. Our trade policies have a huge impact on whether regular Americans - in Iowa and across the country -- have the chance to get ahead in our economy or whether they are left behind. We need a new era in trade policy. We need ""smart trade"" policies that American workers can say yes to - trade policies that do more than pay lip service to their needs and that actually make sure prosperity is shared. Trade policies that are as innovative as the American people. And when I'm president, those are the trade policies we will have. And let me be clear: we will make sure that these policies are in place before we pass a single new trade deal. In my first year in office, I will spend time working with Congress to get our trade policies straight -- policies which ensure that Americans workers finally begin to see benefits from the global economy. And then, when we negotiate new trade deals it won't just be big multinational corporations whose interests are served - it will also be the interests of American workers, America's communities, and our global environment. ***** First, I will be a tough negotiator on new trade deals. There are good trade deals and there are bad trade deals, and when I am president it will be crystal clear that we have a president who knows the difference. It is not enough for a trade deal to be popular on Wall Street or show up in economic statistics. My main measure is just this one - after considering the impact on jobs, wages and prices, will most families be better off? When I'm president, our trade agreements will give workers fair and level playing fields. All our trade partners must meet basic labor standards, such as prohibiting sweatshops and child labor and protecting the right of workers to join unions. These conditions should be the floor, not the ceiling. And they should not be in side agreements, but at the core of the agreements. I will tie unilateral trade preferences and bilateral trade agreements to progress on labor rights. As president, I will also push the World Trade Organization to begin to address labor standards. And I will build on the precedent of the Cambodia textiles agreement, which rewarded progress on labor rights with greater market access. New trade agreements must also include strong rules on environmental protection and against currency manipulation. As the world's biggest customer, our trade deals can be vital tools to ensure that progress is made in stopping global warming. They can also be tools to ensure that poor environmental practices do not create unfair competitive advantages. Second, I will insist that our trade deals be fairly and fully administered. For free trade to be fair, it must be based on rules, and then those rules must be followed. But right now, many major U.S. trading partners are breaking the rules without any consequences. As president, I will seek to restore America's moral leadership of the world, and our trade policies with these countries can help. But we are going to be tough in our negotiations because the overriding obligation of the president of the United States is to put America's workers, economy and national interests first. Right now, China, India and certain other nations are each, to one degree or another, combining miserably low wages and poor environmental practices with tax breaks, subsidies, tariffs, low-cost loans, and currency manipulation to advance their trade at the expense of ours. All of this is costing Americans high-quality jobs and threatening millions more. When I am president, restoring fair and balanced trade with China will be a particular priority. Its massive manipulation of the yuan has continued for years, giving it an unfair advantage against U.S. manufacturers, and its labor and intellectual property protections are grossly inadequate. As a result of the massive trade deficits we run with China - the largest ever between any two countries, more than $230 billion last year alone - China now owns $1 trillion in U.S. assets, giving it great leverage over our economy and our security. This is not acceptable. We need to persuade China's authoritarian government to commit to the rules that govern the conduct of responsible nations. Our trade policies are a great opportunity for increased leverage over China. And, when I'm president I will make it crystal clear that doing business with China should not come at the expense of American jobs or our economy - there must and will be balance between our nations when we trade. As for our good friend India, which has achieved remarkable economic growth in recent years, we still must work hard to get it to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of its trade agreements with the U.S. and to further achieve our shared values, while all the while improving the lives of its millions of citizens. I know following the letter of any law, let alone trade law, isn't a priority for the Bush administration, but it will be for mine. In the Edwards Administration, the top prosecutors at the Department of Justice will be responsible for enforcing our trade agreements. Right now, the trade negotiators charged with enforcing agreements seem to think their job is done when an agreement is signed. Signing a trade deal should be the beginning of the process, not the end. And I will insist that we finally begin to prosecute illegal foreign subsidies, currency manipulation, and trade practices. Fair terms of trade also mean fixing our own tax code so that corporations aren't rewarded for closing plants and shipping jobs to countries like China. Our government should be encouraging businesses to invest here. Yet, one of the starkest examples that our economy works best for big business instead of regular Americans is that we actually give tax incentives to companies to invest overseas. American companies setting up shop in tax havens often pay little or no U.S. tax. This is not only wrong, it's unpatriotic. I will eliminate the tax incentives that encourage companies to invest overseas rather than here at home. These dollars, if invested in new facilities and in retraining workers and rebuilding devastated communities, can fuel a dramatic expansion of our own economy. Third, we need much more investment in helping the workers and communities left behind. When we sign a trade deal, we know which industries and workers will likely be affected by greater competition. We need to restore some honesty to the trade debate and not claim, like too many presidents from both parties have done, that trade will help everyone. This is simply not true. When I am president, every trade agreement will be subject to not only an economic assessment showing how imports and exports will be affected by the agreement, but also to a ""community impact assessment."" We need to make sure trade deals produce real benefits that are widely shared, and we need to get a head start on helping any workers and communities who will be hurt by increases in imports or by competition from other countries. Before I ask Congress to approve any new trade agreement, we will have an honest discussion about the real impact of that agreement on towns and communities and workers across our country. Then we can go into dislocated communities - starting before the jobs are gone - and help them diversify their economies with initiatives modeled on the military base closing commissions, bringing local leaders, employers and unions together to rebuild local economies. We need to be much more aggressive about helping workers and affected communities. Training is no substitute for good trade policies, but we must help workers gain new skills and get ahead. The problem is that, too often, training programs are completely disconnected from the job market. I will create a broad new Training Works program that ties retraining to real jobs. It will support on-the-job training programs through partnerships among businesses, unions and community colleges. Workers will be trained on-the-job to make sure the jobs actually exist. And to make it worth businesses' while - and to support high-wage jobs - we will pay part of workers' wages while they are being trained. All types of workers are affected by globalization, and all types of workers should be eligible for help getting back on their feet. But Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, now only helps manufacturing workers at plant closings. Because most unemployed workers who lose their jobs aren't even covered by unemployment insurance, I will help states modernize their programs. This will give security to 500,000 more jobless workers a year, including more low-wage and part-time workers. And, as we have seen over the last year, another dark side of trade is the concern over the safety of the foods we eat, the toys our children play with, and even the medicines we take. Now more than ever, we need to make sure that our trade rules protect American consumers. Food imports have doubled in the past decade, and Americans now eat three-quarters of a pound of imported food every day. However, less than 1 percent of imported food is inspected. As president, I will enforce mandatory ""country of origin"" labeling for food and other consumer products so that Americans will know who is making the products they are buying. The big meat packers have blocked this law for too long. I will give the FDA all the authority and resources it needs to keep tainted food and products out of our country and out of our homes. We will strengthen enforcement to ensure that safety standards are being met, and we will enforce ""zero tolerance"" and immediately freeze the specific import of any food, toys, medicines, or other goods that threatens the health of our children and families. We will not let them in until we know they are safe, because the health and welfare of our children are more important than cheap toys. We must make sure that trade is not only smart and good for America's economy and workers, but safe for American families. Regular families - their safety and their best interests - should come before the interests of multinational corporations. That's what safe and smart trade is about. You know, some people as they listen to my new smart trade vision for America will accuse me of being a protectionist or anti-trade. They would be wrong. I believe in smart and safe trade, just not trade that helps American multinationals but hurts America. And, let me tell you, you can protect the interests of American workers and still trade. We can grow our economy, and create good jobs and trade responsibly, fairly and safely. With smart trade policies, we can make sure American workers compete on level playing fields. With smart trade policies, we can create a new future where even more workers and their families have a chance to achieve the American Dream. I know we can make trade and our economy work for regular workers, but real change must first begin with ending - once and for all - the influence lobbyists have on trade policies and on our government. It's time Washington worked for the American people, not for lobbyists and insiders. It's time that the president stood up and fought for American workers. It's time to have a president that always - always - puts the interests of the American people first. So today, I'm again calling on all federal officeholders and candidates from all political parties to join me in putting an end to the money game in Washington by simply refusing to accept any form of campaign donation from federal lobbyists going forward. It's really just that simple. We need to send a message to all of the lobbyists in Washington: Your money is no good here, and we're not going to take it anymore. We don't need you, we've got the American people on our side. ***** What I've just said today isn't going to be popular with the special interest groups, lobbyists or Washington insiders. But this isn't about being well-liked. This is about doing what's right. They're going to try to distract you and me from the issues that matter - issues like health care, poverty, jobs and economic fairness. And it's these insiders in Washington who are going to attack us to try to keep people like me from speaking out, but they won't succeed. Because I'm going to fight with every breath I have. Because this isn't about me or them - it's about you, your family, your children, and how those who run for president are going to fight for real change to create a better America where all of us can go as far as our hard work and God-given talents will take us. That's the kind of president I will be. As Harry Truman said, ""The ultimate test of any presidential decision is Ð²ÐÂnot whether it's popular at the time, but whether it's rightÐ²ÐÂ¦If it's right, make it, and let the popular part take care of itself.'"" We know we don't have to live in an America where hard-working men and women are struggling to get by. Where we pass trade deal after trade deal that rip apart communities. Where good people like those who worked at Maytag do right by their country and are still left out in the cold. That's not our America. Our America says if you work hard, you'll have the chance to get ahead and leave your kids a better life. That's the One America we're fighting for. That's our America. And together, I know we can make our One America a reality because the real power of America isn't in Washington, it's with the American people. It's with all of you. And that is why when I'm president, real change is coming. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.","['The trade policies of President Bush have devastated towns and communities all across America', 'Instead, too many of these agreements have cost us jobs and devastated many of our towns', 'As a result of the massive trade deficits we run with China -

1,656,"Hillary Clinton,2008,PA",Dem,1,1.0,122.7315915,Remarks at the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Harrisburg,"Thank you very much. Is labor in the house? I am pleased to be in the House of Labor. I want to thank my friend and your native son, President McEntee, for that introduction and for more than - he hates when I say this - for more than 50 years, 50 years of leadership in AFSCME and the labor movement. When you have Gerry McEntee by your side, there is no battle too tough, there is no challenge too great and I am very grateful for his support and the support of the great union he has. I want to salute Bill George. His tough and passionate leadership of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO is legendary. When Bill asks what time is it, we all know the answer: it's union time. Because under his watch, more and more people are joining unions and becoming part of the labor movement right here in Pennsylvania. I am very cognizant of the fact that Bill and his wonderful family have suffered such a loss in the last month. But I'm sure she's looking down and saying, you're looking good, Bill. And we think you're looking good because you make such a difference to so many people. Isn't it nice to have a president named George you can actually believe in? I also want to recognize Rick Bloomingdale and Pat Eiding. I know that you've already been great to have Mayor Michael Nutter and Congressman Chris Carney. We've got a couple of international presidents, Michael Goodwin and Warren George. I know that Senator Casey was here earlier and I'm looking forward to inviting him to the White House to talk about what we will do on behalf of Pennsylvania and the American labor movement. I started my morning at the William J. Donovan Company where I got to visit with sheet metal workers at a company that's been in business for 95 years, understands the importance of having trained workers, starting people off as apprentices moving towards becoming journeymen. Once again, I was reminded that American workers are the hardest working, most productive workers in the world. As I watched these processes take place and ended up at a part of the factory where it hand work that has to be done because of the precession required. A lot of the work is going to pharmaceutical companies and hospitals that require the highest level of skill. I asked the gentleman working, how long has it taken you to get to the point where you can do this work that is so specific and where the slightest possible imperfection could cause a batch of drugs to be thrown out for example? He said, ""About 25 years."" Started as an apprentice, apprenticed for 10 years, and now doing work that has no equivalent anywhere in the world. These are jobs that can't be outsourced. These are jobs that go right to the heart of the skill and workmanship of American workers. I also think it says something that it takes a lot of experience before you are really, really good to do the job. I flew into Philadelphia yesterday, thanks to union members working in the air traffic control tower. I drove here today in a car built by union members from steel made by union members, over roads laid by union members. We passed by schools where children are taught by union members, by hospitals where people are cared for by union members, came to a hotel that is staffed by union members, in a building that was built by union members. Now, I'm standing here with all the union members who are some of the hardest working, most compassionate, most patriotic Americans I know. So when some people, and you hear them, act like unions have no place in America, I wonder what country they are living in. Unions are America, and unions built America, and made America the greatest, richest, best country in the world. Let's not forget, we know what happens to workers when we don't have unions, don't we. Think about what life would be like here in Pennsylvania before the labor movement. Back in 1903, another courageous union leader and great woman by the name of Mother Jones led a march of children from here in Philadelphia to New York to demand an end to the scourge of child labor. In 1910, a landmark study found more than 500 industrial fatalities in Allegheny County in one year alone. And the Great Steel strike of 1990 included brutal repression of workers in Pittsburgh and protesting work weeks of up to 84 hours. Imagine, 84 hours a week in the dangerous conditions of those steel mills. The labor movement changed America for the better. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. summed up labor's significance before an AFL-CIO gathering much like this one. ""The labor movement,"" he said, ""was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress."" When the wave of union organization crested over the nation, it carried to secure shores not only itself, but the whole society. These words remind us that when Dr. King was taken from us 40 years ago this week, we lost a powerful voice for justice of all kinds, including economic justice. Dr. King knew that unions helped make the American dream a reality for millions of Americans. Labor helped build the middle class. We need unions not just in good times, but in hard times too; especially in hard times. With our economy facing a recession, we need unions standing strong because your negotiations help raise the standard of living for every American worker. When health insurance is out of reach for 47 million Americans, 1.2 million right here in Pennsylvania alone, we need unions standing up for the right, not the privilege, the right to quality affordable health care. When other countries exploit their own workers to get them an unfair advantage, we need unions standing up for workers rights here and around the world. No one knows better than our unions what it means to fight for the underdog. Every day, you are standing up for workers who need someone to stand up with them. And I'm in this race for the very same reason - to fight for everyone who needs a champion in their corner. For me, this campaign is not about me - this campaign is about all of us. This campaign is meant to repudiate the political philosophies and the governing of the last 7 years. Because our current President and Vice President have a very different view of America. They honestly believe that somehow it works best for America when we keep giving more to those who already have more than enough, and that we take away from those who are struggling just to get to the level of subsistence and possibility. That's why they gave big tax breaks to oil companies making record profits, while you pay through the roof at the pump. I met with a group of truck drivers in Harrisburg yesterday. They are pretty fed up with high fuel prices and they were making their opinions known. Who is listening? I'm listening, but it doesn't seem like the White House is listening. The president is too busy holding hands with the Saudis to care about American truck drivers who can't afford to fill up their tank any longer. I meet workers all over Pennsylvania and elsewhere who lost their pensions; they have seen companies go into bankruptcy and discharge their obligations. We have a vice president, who, when he was CEO of Halliburton which now gets all these no bid contracts, don't they, from the government? Workers lost $25 billion in pensions. But Dick Cheney got to strap on a golden parachute worth $20 million. You get tax breaks to people who don't need them while our children get stuck with the bill. Now, I never thought I'd say this but ever since my husband got out of full time public service, he's actually made money, much to both of our amazement. But I have to confess, as recipients of all of George Bush's tax breaks, I can tell you I didn't need them, I didn't want them, I didn't ask for them. And when I am president, we're going to take those back from people making over $250,000 a year in America. And has there ever been in recent history a more anti-union, anti-labor president and White House? They are not just looking for the union label; they are looking to squash the union bug. They want to eliminate unions and union workers - it's ideological, it's personal. After seven disastrous years of George Bush and Dick Cheney, the stakes in this election couldn't be higher. And the need to change course couldn't be more urgent. But I am here to tell you, Senator John McCain, a friend of mine, someone whose service to our country I admire, is only offering more of the same. John McCain admits he doesn't understand the economy - and unfortunately he's proving that day after day on the campaign trail. He looked at the housing crisis, and he blamed consumers. His plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100 billion additional corporate tax cut. The Bush/McCain philosophy could not be clearer - it's the ""ownership society"", which really means ""you're on your own."" If you're not a crony, if you're not wealthy, if you're not well-connected, you fend for yourself; the others are taken care of it. But don't take just my word for it. Even a Republican Senator Mel Martinez from Florida after listening to Senator McCain's economic pan gave it an ""incomplete,"" and he said: ""where I think he fell short"" is the fact that we need to do some things that can help families, that can help people."" Well, duh. Yeah, we do. We need to do something that can help the American people for a change - put the middle class back into the driver's seat. Give our families the opportunities they deserve. You know, sometimes when that phone rings at 3am in the White House it's an economic crisis. It seems like John McCain would just let it ring and ring and ring. Well that's not good enough for the families that I have met across Pennsylvania. I was with a group of families in Harrisburg yesterday at a diner, sitting around talking. What were they concerned about? The high price of gas; losing their homes to foreclosure, being able to afford to send or keep a child in college; wondering where that next job is going to come from. These are the stories and concerns that are on the minds of the people here in Pennsylvania. I think we've had enough of a president who didn't know enough about economics, and didn't do enough for the American middle class. We're ready for a president who will meet the challenges of our time. Now I know taking on Senator McCain in November won't be easy. Republicans aren't going to give up without a fight. And no matter how beautiful your rhetoric, the Republicans are not going to turn off their attack machine - it doesn't have an off switch. But one thing you know about me is that when I say I'll fight for you, I'll fight for you. I know how to fight for you and that's exactly what I will do throughout this campaign. Look, I know there will be hurdles and setbacks between now and November. But I also know that I'm ready. I know what it's like to stumble. I know what it means to get knocked down. But I've never stayed down. I never will. And neither will you and neither will America. We are on the comeback trail as a country. This is one of the most important elections we've ever had. There is so much at stake. You heard as President George talked about what a difference it made to go from a Republican governor and Republican senators and Republican members of Congress. But we've got to finish the job and it's so important that the people of Pennsylvania have their voices heard and their votes counted. Senator Obama says he's getting tired of the campaign. His supporters say they want it to end. Could you imagine if Rocky Balboa had gotten half way up those Art Museum stairs and said, ""Well, I guess that's about far enough?"" That's not the way it works. Let me tell you something, when it comes to finishing the fight, Rocky and I have a lot in common. I never quit. I never give up. And I know that we are going to make it together - not just up those stairs, but we are going to climb that mountain to a better day for America. We have so much work to do and we won't get there if we quit or we walk away. We'll get there by staying and fighting and standing up for what we believe in. But I don't need to tell any of you this. No one knows better than organized labor how important it is to have a fighter on your side. When you send someone to the bargaining table, you need the strongest, toughest, most determined person you've got. Not someone who is just going to talk about problems. But someone who will roll up her sleeves and get the job done for you. A President who gets up everyday and asks, ""What am I going to do for the American people today? What am I going to do to make sure you've got good jobs that can't be outsourced? What am I going to do to make sure we have trade agreements that are pro-American and pro-worker and make sure that we can compete with anybody, anywhere, anytime?"" If you give me the chance, that's the kind of president I will be. That's what I'll do because that's what I've always done. Alongside labor, I fought for and passed an extension of unemployment insurance in the wake of September 11. I went to the floor of the Senate everyday and stood up to the Republicans and said we are going to extend and expand unemployment insurance until we finally got it done. Alongside labor, I'm fighting on behalf of the brave and patriotic workers who came to Ground Zero after September 11. Across the entire New York area, ironworkers, operating engineers, laborers, everybody dropped what they were doing and came rushing to see how they could help; so many of them got sick. They had to quit working. The man who could carry hundreds of pounds, run marathons could barely walk up stairs or breathe. Alongside labor, I've fought for the collective bargaining rights of federal employees, The Department of Health and Human Services, The Department of Homeland Security, The Department of Defense, TSA screeners, and public servants like our firefighters and police officers. Alongside labor, I've supported the Helmets to Hardhats program, to help veterans get those good jobs that they deserve to have after their service. I'm working with my good friend, Congressman Murtha to expand this program and I am so proud to have Jack Murtha's endorsement. There isn't anyone I would rather have in a foxhole for a tough campaign and a tough election than Jack Murtha. And I've fought alongside labor in my home state of New York - home to one out of every seven union members in America. I've urged CEOs to return to the bargaining table, encouraged employer neutrality in organizing campaigns. I've urged construction companies to hire local union workers, and I've joined workers on the picket line. I'll keep standing with you, fighting for you, and speaking out every single day as President of the United States. Because I don't think the work ends with the election - the work begins with the election. We have to get into that White House. We're going to have to clean house once we get there. I'll start by ending this Administration's practice of harassing and bureaucratizing our labor organizations, making it impossible for you to do the work that you are entitled to do. And how's this for a radical idea: We're actually going to appoint people to the Department of Labor, the NLRB, and throughout the government who are actually pro-labor for a change. Next, we're going to stop outsourcing our government to private companies that are too often less qualified - and less accountable and actually cost more. Why on earth would we pay a private contractor more to do what a government employee was doing better for less? And let me just say this, I am deeply concerned about acceleration of the outsourcing of production for essential defense material. I was in Indiana the last couple of days of last week - everywhere I went talking to good hardworking Hoosiers, I heard about how company after company that used to do defense work had either lost the work or the company was gone. One specific example just stuck in my mind. All of you have seen those pictures of the precision guided missiles, right? Going down chimneys, hitting targets thousands of miles away. Well, the targeting is dependent upon these magnets and the magnets used to be made in Indiana, the company called Magnequest. The company was bought out, jobs were eliminated, production was moved to China. Not only did we lose jobs, we lost essential, valuable information because you're not going to tell me that the Chinese military doesn't have exactly what it takes to make those magnets. Now we are going to outsource our refueling tankers. Here's what I would do as president; I would strengthen our national defense that support both our men and women in uniform and American workers, and prevent the exporting of essential knowledge that keeps us safe and enables us to have the greatest military in the world. Most important of all we'll protect the right to organize for a new generation. This is a basic right and you know it's under attack. That's why I'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act. I am proud to stand up for it, speak out for it and fight for it in the Senate. We're going to take our case to the American people. And when I'm President, I would sign it into law, and you're all invited to the signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. So if anyone asks you if labor will have a seat at the table in my White House. I hope you know my answer - of course you will. Labor built that table. There's going to be enough chairs around it for everybody to have a place. We're going to negotiate a new American bargain - for all of our people. Let me tell you what it will include: First, I will fight for every single job in America, we can't save them all, but we're going to save a lot more of them than we have been lately. Then we're going to create millions of new, high paying jobs that can't be outsourced. President Bush has stood by and watched as we've lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since he became president. He's doing nothing about the loopholes in our tax code that actually encourage companies to ship jobs overseas. Meanwhile, Senator McCain believes business as usual on trade is just fine. He says that some lost jobs ""are not coming back;"" that seems fine with him too. Well I think it's time for a different approach. Today, I am announcing an aggressive infrastructure agenda will create at least 3 million jobs over the next decade. After the failed levees in New Orleans, the tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota, we don't need any more devastating wake up calls. And you don't have to look any further than the problems you had with I-95 to know that we have to take action now. We're trying to run today's economy on yesterday's infrastructure - our bridges, our tunnels, our roads, our water systems and so much else - and we are jeopardizing American prosperity. So I will rebuild America by rebuilding, repairing and modernizing our infrastructure. And I want to salute the work of your great governor, another incredibly visionary effective leader, Ed Rendell on this issue. He has not only made great strides here in Pennsylvania but he's leading the way nationally on infrastructure. I intend to work closely with him as President. My Rebuild America plan will create a $10 billion Emergency Fund to identify and repair critical infrastructure problems. We'll modernize our transportation systems. We've got a lot of transportation and transit workers here and I'm proud to have your support. We're going to invest in public transit and inter-city rail. We're going to connect America with a national broadband infrastructure. All of our communication workers, our electrical workers, we need to have super information highway the way we have an interstate highway system so every part of America gets connected up, part of the global economy. We'll create a National Infrastructure Bank and I will use bonding authority to make these long-term investments. Think about it, in World War II we had War Bonds. Maybe it's time we ask Americans if they want to play a part in rebuilding America. I think millions and millions of Americans will make those contributions. Then we're going to turn around and put them into projects that will strengthen our economy and create room for that economy to grow. We can put at least 3 million Americans to work. We're also going to create at least 5 million additional jobs in green energy. Jobs making public buildings more energy efficient. Jobs weatherizing homes to make sure that people get more value for their dollar, to save on home heating and cooling bills. Jobs that will re-open shuttered factories to build the clean energy technologies. I was last night in Bucks County at one of the keystone industrial port centers, I saw these big wind turbines being made, with as I understand it union workers from the steelworkers, and I saw the future, and it is a future that we can expand. How will I pay for that? Take the tax subsidies away from the oil companies and put them to work in clean renewable energy. This is another critical difference between me and my Democratic opponent. My opponent talks about clean energy on the campaign trail, but when he had a chance to do something about it in the Senate - remember where I come from, my dad was from Scranton, actions speak louder than words - when he had a chance to do something about it he actually voted for Dick Cheney's energy bill. I voted against it. Once again, when it was time to turn talk into action, his promises were just words. We have to be smart and tough at the same time, it's not going to be easy to take on the oil companies and the oil producing countries. But I'm ready to do it and with your help starting on April 22nd that is just what I will do. We'll going to make trade work for American families. Now, I've been criticized by both President Bush and Senator Obama for this, but I believe we need a time-out on new trade deals. I've been saying that for some time now. We've got to have new trade policies before we have new trade deals. That includes no trade deal with Columbia while violence against trade unionists continues in that country. I appreciate Gerry talking about how I did speak out and oppose NAFTA, the president made a different decision but whether its President McEntee or David Gergen or the people that were in those meetings in the White House, they know that I raised a big yellow caution flag, I said I'm not sure that this will work. And I have a plan to fix NAFTA, with the strongest possible labor and environmental standards in the core text of the agreement. And unlike my opponent, I will never come to Pennsylvania and tell the people here one thing while my staff says something else to a foreign government. You won't find me saying anything like that. When I say I'll fix NAFTA, I mean it - and I will back it up with action. Yes, we will finally get tough on China. Right now, China's steel comes here and our jobs go there. I testified before the international trade commission to try to put the breaks on the dumping of steel in our market. They manipulate their currency, they give illegal subsidies, they abuse workers' rights. And what do we get in return? Tainted fish, lead-laced toys, and poisoned pet food and polluted pharmaceuticals. That is a bad deal for America. When I'm President, China will be a trade partner not a trade master. And we're going to get that done. Finally, we're going to start investing in manufacturing again. Pennsylvania has lost 13,000 manufacturing jobs in the past year; nearly one-in-four manufacturing jobs since George Bush became president. Manufacturing thrived in Pennsylvania throughout the 20th Century. It can thrive again. I disagree with people who say we can't be a manufacturing company again because I believe you can't have a strong economy if you don't make things. I don't believe you can support all these other jobs that you represent workers in if you're not generating jobs from actually producing things. So, for me, it's not just a question of what's nice, it's critical and essential that we bring manufacturing back. We also need it for our defense sector, as I mentioned earlier. So, there's going to be a lot of work to be done and we're going to have a very progressive agenda for working families. I will provide health care for every body, not leaving any one out. Because it is long past time that we had affordable health care for every single American. And the big difference between me and my Democratic opponent. I'm sure tomorrow he'll tell you he has a plan for universal health care, but his plan would leave out 15 million people, more than 400,000 here in Pennsylvania. You're going to leave out a member of the Painter's Union or a member of their family? Are you going to leave out someone who is already sick? You're going to leave out somebody who is making minimum wage? He chose to leave health care on the bargaining table when putting together his campaign. I'm not just going to talk about universal health care; I'm going to get it done. And the reason I am is because I am passionately committed to making our country do what we have not done both morally and economically. I could tell you hundreds of stories and I bet all of you could. You are so fortunate to have health care because you a member of a union and people negotiate for it. But, I was in Ohio, along the Ohio River during that campaign - I really liked how that Ohio primary turned out by the way - and what I heard was this typical tragic story - the kind of story I've heard for 15 years and even longer going back to Arkansas. I was eating in a mobile with some folks in the area, the deputy sheriff. He said I sure hope we can get health care for everyone and he told me about a young woman from that town. She worked at the local pizza parlor. She didn't have anyone representing her. She got paid minimum wage, she didn't have anybody saying you know, minimum wage is a poverty wage, you can't make a living on minimum wage. She got pregnant and she was having trouble so she went to the nearest hospital. And I don't blame the hospital, but they said, look, we can't do anymore free care. You're from a neighboring town - there was no hospital in her county - you have to give us a $100 before we exam you. She didn't have $100. She went home. A little while later, she was still having trouble. She went back to the hospital and they told her the same thing. The third time she went to the hospital, she was in an ambulance. The doctors, the nurses in the emergency room tried to help her, but they couldn't save the baby and the baby died. And she was in such distress, they had to airlift her to the nearest big city in Columbus - take her the medical center. In the intensive care unit for 15 days, doctors and nurses and the hospital personnel did everything they could to save her life. Sitting there in that mobile home listening to that story was just upsetting me so much. I think it's morally wrong in our country, a young women and her baby died because she didn't have health insurance. I think it is so economically wrong. And for the lack of $100 to examine her and do what was necessary to save her and her baby, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent. We can do so much better than that. I will not rest as your president until we finally have quality, affordable, health care for every single American. There's a lot of work to be done, and I'm prepared to do that work. I've apprenticed and I've learned how to do it. I have watched it being done for 8 years. I've been on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and I know very well what it takes for the president and the Congress to actually make the changes we need. I'm going to propose cutting middle class taxes by $100 billion and I think we can get it done. Because that money is going to go towards helping you afford college, help you afford to take care of an elderly relative, help you to afford health care. I'm going to stand up again to President Bush's ill-advised policies, and I'm going to end the unfunded mandate known as No Child Left Behind and we're going to start anew with the kind of partnership we need from a president. We're going to give Americans a secure retirement and we're going to make sure Social Security is safe and solid. None of this would be easy, but nothing worth doing is easy. I was thinking about that looking at the sheet metal workers today. How many mistakes were made before that perfection was reached? How much work had to be done before you felt confident in trusting that new assignment or that young sheet metal worker? We could go through any kind of work any of you do and say the same thing. Well, it's true about our government too. It's not going to be easy, but we can make it happen. Again, as Dr. King said, ""either we go up together, or we go down together."" And Gerry, he spoke those words 40 years ago this week, the sanitation workers on strike in Memphis - members of AFSCME Local 1733 - he urged them to move on, and that's what I urge us. There isn't anything we can't do as Americans once we start acting like Americans again - once we roll up our sleeves and we get to work. Some of you have heard me say this before, and I'll say it again it took a Clinton to clean up after the first Bush, and it'll take a Clinton to clean up after the second Bush and with your help, that is exactly what we're going to do. Thank you and God bless you, and God bless America.","[""I disagree with people who say we can't be a manufacturing company again because I believe you can't have a strong economy if you don't make things"", ""His plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100 billion additional corporate tax cut"", 'I testified before the international trade commission to try to put the breaks on the dumping of steel in our market', ""They manipulate their currency, they give illegal subsidies, they abuse workers' rights"", 'King said, ""either we go up together, or we go down together.""

Well, let me -- let begin by thanking you for inviting me to be with you today, thanking Steve for his introduction, and most of all, thanking the steelworkers for their long, long support of what I've been trying to do throughout my entire political career. I don't get any money and I don't want any money from corporations. Never got a nickel.  Don't want any money from the billionaire class.  But I am very grateful for the support that I've received from the steelworkers throughout my entire political career. Thank you, guys, very, very much.  When I went to college, I studied some economics, but the real economic lesson that I learned was when I was a kid. I grew up in a home where my dad had come from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. Never made much money. Mother graduated high school. I lived in a three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and we lived not poor, but our family lived on the financial stress as is the case with millions and millions of families in our country today. So the major economics lesson that I have had in my life was not in high school and not in college, it was as a kid understanding what financial stress does to a family, understanding that every decision that is made has got to be thought about, whether you can afford to do this or whether you can afford to do that. And that, brothers and sisters, is a lesson I have never forgotten and I never will forget.  You know, one of the reasons I think our campaign is doing well is because we try to talk about the real issues impacting the American people. Don't do necessarily do what the media wants us to do, but talk about real issues. Just turned out yesterday -- just happened. We were in Iowa Falls, had a few hundred people out to a meeting. And I kind of opened up the discussion to ask people what was going on in their lives, what was going on in their lives in terms of trying to make it on $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And suddenly what was it like in their lives if you can't afford the prescription drugs that you need. And I want to thank the nurses, our sisters and brothers; are there nurses here?  Who know these issues, who know what it means to be treating patients who can't afford prescriptions. And I opened it up, the discussion. One woman gets up there and says the medicine her family need -- I think it was her husband needed -- shot way up, shot way up to an outrageous price. And we all know that tomorrow, if you walk into a drug store to refill your prescription, the price could be double or triple than what was paid today. Some of you have that experience, right? Because the pharmaceutical industry is ripping off the American people.  So people talk -- we don't have a lot of money. The cost of prescription drugs goes way up. Then another woman says -- you know, I was using the point -- making the point, millions of people in this country -- we don't talk about it terribly much -- trying to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year on Social Security. You do the arithmetic. Tell me how you pay for health care. Tell me how you pay for prescription drugs. How do you heat your home. How do you buy the food you need on $12,000 or $13,000 a year? And the answer is exactly right, you don't. You don't.  And then we got Republicans going around the country lying, as they occasionally do......and they're saying Social Security is going broke. We have to cut Social Security benefits. AUDIENCE: No! SANDERS: Now, just stop and think about it. Forget politics. Tell me how somebody can go around the country when we know that millions of people -- seniors, disabled vets, people with disabilities, people who can't make it on $1,000, $13,000 a year, and they're talking about cutting Social Security benefits. There's a thing that a lot of people have not heard of. It's called the chain CPI. Anybody know what the chain CPI is? It's a fancy term from Washington to cut Social Security benefits, and it argues, the theory behind it is that the COLAs, the cost-of-living adjustments that seniors are getting today are too generous. Does anybody here know what seniors got in their COLA last year? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Zero! SANDERS: Zero! Too generous. Got to cut it. Anyhow, at Iowa Falls we heard from people who told us no, I'm not getting $12,000, $13,000 a year, I'm trying to live on $10,000 a year. And then we heard another woman talk about what it means to have minimum wage jobs and how difficult it is to survive. And that is the reality for millions and millions of people in this country. It's a reality we don't talk enough about and it's certainly a reality that we are not effectively addressing. Now, here's the story. If we were a poor country -- and there are poor countries around the world -- you have a certain type of discussion. And you say, you know, it's unfortunate that we have to live in poverty, but that's who we are. We're a poor country. We can't have good education, we can't have good health care, we can't have decent paying jobs. We're a poor country. But the truth is, as everybody here knows, the United States of America is not a poor country. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But -- but most people don't know that because almost all of the new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent. And brothers and sisters, what a Sanders administration is about is a very radical idea. You ready for a radical idea? We're going to create an economy that works for working families, not just billionaires.  And not only that. In the last 30 years, as everybody in this room knows, technology has exploded. Almost every worker in America is more productive than he or she was 20 years, 30 years ago, right? You're producing more. Question. If you are more productive, if we are producing more, why are millions of people working longer hours for lower wages? AUDIENCE: Greed! SANDERS: Why is almost all new income and wealth going to a small number of people? AUDIENCE: Greed! SANDERS: You guys are a smart group here. All right. and that's what we're going to deal with. So we are going to tell billionaires who pay an effective tax rate lower than many of you do, we're going to tell large multi-national corporations who make billions of dollars a year in profit and stash their money in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year may pay zero in federal income taxes, we're going to tell them that it is time for them to accept their responsibility as Americans to start paying their fair share of taxes.  And when we eliminate the Cayman Islands loophole and when we raise a trillion dollars in new revenue, you know what we're going to do with that? We're going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of decent paying jobs.  This is the United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth. You tell me why our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our waste water plants, our levees, our dams, our airports, our rail system are deteriorating or crumbling? AUDIENCE: Republicans!  SANDERS: All right. We need to invest in a $1 trillion investment, which I believe we should make, creates 13 million decent paying jobs.  Including a lot of good steelworker jobs.  Now, every person in this room -- because of the steelworkers or one of the great unions in our country, you understand the history of the trade union movement. And you understand that change, real change, never comes from the top on down. It always comes from the bottom on up.  And you understand that way back when employers did not say, ""Well, you know, I think it's a great idea for workers to have a union. We'd love to sit down and do some collective bargaining with you because we think that's fair and that's right."" That's not the way it happened. The way it happened is way back when, workers went on strike, workers fought and workers died, workers were beaten, workers were fired from their jobs in order to make sure that working people could organize, could engage in collective bargaining, could sit down at a table and fight for decent wages and decent working conditions. That's the history of the trade union movement and we should be proud of that. But what all of you know is that over the last several decades, despite the fact that millions of workers want to join a union, it has become harder and harder for workers to in fact create unions, to become members of unions. You know and I know that employers have acted illegally with the support of the NLRB so that if workers tried to organize, the organizers there would be fired, and if by some miracle people actually did organize a union, employers would refuse to engage in a first contract, collective bargaining, . And that is why I believe that the middle class does not grow unless the trade union movement grows.  The middle class does not prosper unless workers are engaged in strong collective bargaining. Now...  Now, what a lot of people -- what a lot of non-union people don't understand is that to the degree they get anywhere near decent wages -- decent wages, it has a lot to do with the success of the trade union movement because you're driving wages up.  In any case, after decades of illegal action on the part of employers, it seems to me we have got to make it easier, not harder for workers to join unions. That's why we have introduced a new FCOP piece of legislation, and it says very simply that if 50 percent of workers in a unit plus one sign a card saying they want to be in a union, they will have a union.  Here's the truth. Here's the truth. Not going to tell you that every worker in America wants to join a union, but what I will tell you is that millions of them do. Millions of them understand that workers who have a union get better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. And our job is to say that the American people must be able to exercise their constitutional right to organize unions without illegal impediments on the part of employers, and that is what I intend to do.  I mentioned earlier that there are millions of seniors and disabled veterans in this country. And by the way, as the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, let me thank all of the men and women in this room and in this country for their service to our country.  For their putting their lives on the line to defend this country. And here's a promise I make, is that we will do our best, absolute best, and there should not be any debate about this whether you're a conservative, progressive, Democrat or Republican. When people put their lives on the line to defend this country and they come home, they are going to get the best health care available. They're going to get the benefits that they earned.  But here's the difference that Secretary Clinton and I have on a very important issue. I believe that when millions of seniors and disabled vets are struggling to get by on $12,000 or $13,000 a year, it is not good enough to say -- and I've led the effort on this, that we're not going to cut Social Security. That is an abomination. What we must do is say, ""Of course we're not going to cut Social Security, but we are going to expand Social Security benefits.""  And here is how we are going to do it. It is not complicated. Right now, somebody makes $5 million a year, somebody makes $118,000 a year, they both contribute the same amount into the Social Security trust fund. If you lift that cap and you start at $250,000 and above, top 1.5 percent of the American people, what we can do is increase Social Security benefits for those now living under $16,000 a year by $1,300 a year. That's not insignificant for people who are struggling.  And when we do that, we also extend the life of Social Security from 19 years to 50 years. Now, that is my view. I think -- I think that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the wealthy are getting much wealthier, you know what? I think it is just appropriate, just right to lift that cap, and ask the wealthiest people in this country to make sure that all seniors can live in dignity.  That is my view, if Secretary Clinton drops in, ask her her view. I don't think she agrees. Now, when we talk -- and Steve raised this issue. When we talk about why it is that the great middle class of this country is disappearing, why it is that we have 47 million people living in poverty, why it is that we have massive wealth and income inequality, one of the important reasons is our disastrous trade policies.  You are looking at a former United States congressman. I represented Vermont in the Congress for 16 years, and a senator today. You are looking at a member of the Senate, who in his life, voted against NAFTA, against CAFTA, against PNTR with China.  And by the way, is helping to lead the opposition to the TPP. Now...  Look -- look, everybody in this room understands what these disastrous trade agreements are about. You all know who wrote these trade agreements. Not complicated. The steelworkers did not write these trade agreements. They are written by corporate America to benefit corporate America, people who could care less about what these trade agreements did to working families. Here's what they've done. Since 2001 in America, we have lost 60,000 factories. Got that? In my state, in Iowa, all across this country -- 60,000 factories. Not all of that, to be fair, is attributable to trade. There are other reasons why factories shut down, but a lot of it is attributable to trade. And when you lose 60,000 factories, many of them attributable to disastrous trade agreements, you're talking about the loss of millions of good-paying American jobs.  Everybody knows what the purpose of these trade agreements were supposed to do. They did exactly what corporate America wanted them to do -- what they were designed to do is to say, why should we pay workers in the United States $20, $25, $30 an hour, provide decent benefits, negotiate with unions, protect the environment, why would any corporation want to do that when they could shut down in America, throw people out on the street, move to China, move to Mexico, move to low-wage countries, pay people pennies an hour, not have to worry about the environment, not have to do deal with unions and then they can bring their products right back in this country? AUDIENCE: Greed! SANDERS: The simple truth is, and it's indisputable, these trade agreements have been a disaster for working families in this country. They have benefited the CEOs of large multinational corporations. No one can deny that reality. I am proud to tell you that way back when I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA and helped lead the opposition against all of these trade agreements. But I got to tell you also, these trade agreements have been supported not just by Republicans but by some Democrats as well. We've got to acknowledge that. Where we are today is to say that when our country is de- industrializing -- do you know what I mean by that? What I mean, you tell me how are we a great nation if we're not purchasing the products that we need that are made in our country? Can you be a great country? Can you be a great country where everything you buy is made in China? I don't think so. I don't think so. And by the way -- this is another important point to be made. It is not only the loss of jobs, it is what we call the race to the bottom. So here's what's going on. People are saying -- and this is a good thing -- people are saying, well, you know what? We're seeing an uptick in manufacturing in America. Good. Take a look at the wages that those new manufacturing jobs are paying. There was once a time when manufacturing jobs, unionized manufacturing jobs, were the gold standard for the working class of this country. You had a good job in a manufacturing plant, you had a union, you were making middle-class wages and middle-class benefits. But then -- I'll tell you a story. A couple years ago in Louisville, Kentucky, General Electric announced that they were expanding their manufacturing capabilities, creating a couple hundred jobs. Some people were very excited about it. And they asked this guy from GE, they said, why are you doing this? He said, well, it turns out that if you add all of the these things together, transportation costs and the fact that wages in America have gone down, it is actually more competitive to do manufacturing in America now than in China because wages have gone down so much. So they're paying people in manufacturing $10, $12 an hour. Now, if manufacturing workers are getting paid $10, $12 an hour, what do you think other workers are going to be getting? This is the race to the bottom, what they have always wanted. Not to bring Chinese wages up to where we were, it's to bring our wages down to where Chinese wages were.  So this TPP; they want us to support the TPP. They want our people to compete against workers in Vietnam. I have nothing against workers in Vietnam. I was there, they work very hard. Minimum wage in Vietnam is 65 cents an hour. I do not want American workers to have to compete against people who are making 65 cents an hour.  So we have to take a deep breath. We have to understand that our trade policies have failed and we have to begin an entirely new set of policies. And the bottom line for me is that every major corporation in America wants all of us to buy their products. Can't turn on the TV, buy this, buy that, buy that. Well, if they want us to buy their products, they damn well better start manufacturing those products back in the United States and not in China.  Let me touch on another important issue and I'm glad our brothers and sisters from the nurses union -- and we thank you so much for your support.  The reason that the nurses are supporting our campaign is that these are serious people who want to be able to do their job as well as they can. All right. Thank you job is to prevent disease. Their job is to take care of people who are sick. But right now they and many, many other people in the health care profession are unable to do the job that they were trained to do. Now, I think the Affordable Care Act has made some important steps forward and one important step forward that we are not going to allow to go forward is the so-called Cadillac Tax. We have delayed that and we will continue to push that back. Workers who gave up wage increases and other benefits for decent health care should not be penalized for those sacrifices.  But the Affordable Care Act, which I voted for and strongly supported, did a couple -- number of good things. It did away with this obscenity called pre-existing conditions. You all know what that is?  This private insurance obscenity which said if you had a disease years ago, they would not cover you for the disease that you needed coverage for. It's like getting fire insurance except that if you have a fire, then they don't pay. We got rid of that. We have expanded health insurance to some 17 million Americans. We have made it fairer for women who are forced to pay higher rates than they should have for the crime of being a woman. So we kind of eliminated that. But having said that, here's the reality of health care today. And what our campaign is about is asking the American people to think big, not small. Here we are. The United States of America today is the only major country on earth -- the only one, that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right. They do it in England. They do it in France, do it in Germany, do it all over Scandinavia. I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border, they do it. Every major country does it. In America today, 29 million people today have no health insurance at all. Millions more have high deductibles and high co-payments. Sound familiar? OK. And by the way, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. At a time when one in five Americans are unable to afford the prescription drugs their doctors are prescribing, at a time when seniors are cutting their pills in half because they can't afford to buy what they need, the three major drug companies in America last year made $45 billion in profit. And because they are so powerful, because they provide hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions, because they have 1,400 lobbyists in Washington, D.C., there is no legislation on the books to prevent them from doubling, tripling, quadrupling the price you pay for medicine. They are getting away with murder and in some cases, they are committing murder.  We hear from oncologists who are hearing from cancer patients and they're telling us our cancer patients can't afford the medicine that they need. We are dealing in some cases with folks who have Hepatitis C. A new drug, a very effective drug out, do you know what that costs? A thousand dollars a pill. What we have got to tell the pharmaceutical industry -- now, let me back up and tell you a story for a minute. Late 1990s, when I represented Vermont in the Congress, I took a bus load of women from northern Vermont over the Canadian border to Montreal. And the reason we went is that I knew is that prescription drugs in Canada were much less expensive. Women who were dealing with breast cancer, working class women, walked into the pharmacy. They purchased the breast cancer medicine that they needed -- this is not generic, brand name medicine for one-tenth the price they're paying in the United States. I was the first member of Congress to do that. Others followed. Now millions of people, by the way, get their medicine from Canada. We should not have to get medicine from Canada. Pharmaceutical industry has got to stop ripping us off.  Now, when you got 29 million uninsured, even more underinsured, when we're paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, it turns out that we are spending per person in health care almost three times more than they do in the United Kingdom where they guarantee health care to all of their people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French who guarantee health care to all of their people, much more than the Canadians who guarantee all of -- health care to all of their people. It seems to me that the time is now for us to say loudly and clearly that in the United States of America, health care is a right for all people.  And we are going to pass a Medicare for all single payer programs.  And when we do that -- when we do that, not only do we make the nurses and the doctors' jobs easier, because they're going to be able to treat everybody in a comprehensive way, we're going to save the middle class many thousands of dollars a year on health care costs.  We began our campaign for the presidency of the United States nine months ago, and when we began it, I think we were at three, four percent in the polls. We didn't have any money. We didn't have any organization, and frankly, not so many people outside of Vermont knew who Bernie Sanders was. But the message that we have been bringing forth to the American people, a message which says that the economy today is rigged, that it benefits the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of everybody else, that the campaign finance system that exists today is corrupt and undermining American democracy...  That message is resonating all across this country. And here we are in Iowa, and one week from yesterday there will be the first caucus in the country. I believe that we have an excellent chance to win that caucus if -- and here is the if. If we have a large voter turnout.  It is going to be a very, very close election, but I believe that if working people want to be part of a campaign which says enough is enough, our government has got to represent all of us and not a handful of campaign contributors, if those people come out and vote, we will win and we'll win big.  Let me also say this. Let me also say this. This campaign is different from other campaigns, not just because of the fact that I am perhaps the most progressive member of the Senate and my agenda in this campaign is the most progressive. This campaign is more than that. And that is what I say every single day and I repeat to you now from the bottom of my heart. No president, not Bernie Sanders, not anybody else, can do it alone. All right?  Now, I want to tell you a painful truth that you understand as proud trade unionists, but not all people in America understand. And that is the powers that be -- Wall Street, whose greed and recklessness and illegal behavior brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, they have endless supplies of money, endless. In fact, somebody on Wall Street now, I think just announced is going to spend $600,000 in ads against me here in Iowa this week -- $600,000 from one guy. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Give them hell, Bernie! SANDERS: We surely will.  So, you got the power of Wall Street. I want to remind you something about Wall Street. You know, Congress, against my vote, helped to bail them out because the banks were too big to fail. You remember that? Well, you won't be shocked to know that three out of the four largest banks in this country are bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. And you know what I think? When you have a handful of huge financial institutions with incredible economic and political power, maybe it is time we broke them up.  But it's not just Wall Street. You deal all of the time with corporate America, whose greed, whose unquenchable greed, they want more and more and more, and they are prepared to step on every working person in this country to get more and more and more. We got to take them on. Got to take on the corporate media that decides what we see and what we hear. We got to take on the large campaign contributors. That's not an easy fight, and no one president alone can do it. And that is why, what this campaign is about is a political revolution.  We need trade unionists. We need millions of people to stand up and be involved in the political process in a way that we have not seen for a very, very long time. What we are fighting for, brothers and sisters, is not only for our well-being, we are fighting for our kids. We are fighting for our parents. We are fighting for the planet. This is a fight that we cannot afford to lose. And together we will not lose. Thank you very much.

3,77,"Barack Obama,2008,PA",Dem,1,1.0,90.7469265,"Remarks to the Alliance for American Manufacturing in Pittsburgh, PA","Being here in Pennsylvania with the primary coming up, I know that politics is what's on a lot of people's minds. But as I look out at this crowd, I also know that being here isn't just about politics for me. It's personal. Because it reminds me why I entered public service in the first place. As some of you might know, after college, I went to work as a community organizer for a group of churches on the South Side of Chicago. The job was to help lift communities that had been devastated when the local steel plants fell on hard times. Thousands of folks had been laid off and some plants were closing down. And I can still remember the first time I saw a shuttered steel mill. It was late in the afternoon and I took a drive with another organizer over to the old Wisconsin Steel plant on the southeast side of Chicago. Some of you may know it. And as we drove up, I saw a sight that's probably familiar to some of you. I saw a plant that was empty and rusty. And behind a chain-link fence, I saw weeds sprouting up through the concrete, and an old mangy cat running around. And I thought about all the good jobs it used to provide, and all the kids who used to work there in the summer to make some extra money for college. What I came to understand was that when a plant shuts down, it's not just the workers who pay a price, it's the whole community. I saw folks who felt like their government wasn't looking out for them and who had given up hope. So I worked with unions and the city government, and we brought the community together to fight for its common future. We gave job-training to the jobless and hope to the hopeless, and block by block, we helped turn those neighborhoods around. More than twenty years later, as I've traveled across Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, and Ohio, and all across this country, I'm still seeing too many places where plants have closed down and where folks are feeling like they're not getting a fair shot at life, like their dreams are slipping further out of reach. And that's partly because of the same kinds of global economic pressures that led steel plants in Chicago to close down in the 1980s. But it's also because George Bush has pursued policies that don't work for working Americans. In recent years, we've seen more than 3 million high-quality manufacturing jobs disappear, and more than 40,000 factories close down. And more often than not, the few jobs that are being created pay less than the ones we're losing and come without health insurance or a pension, which makes it even harder for families to feel secure about their future. But we also know this is a problem that goes beyond the failures of George Bush - because for decades, through both Democratic and Republican administrations, we've seen the number of American-owned steel companies dwindle down. For decades, our economic policies have been written to pump up a corporate bottom line, rather than promote what's right, without any consideration for the burden we all bear when workers are abused or the environment is destroyed. It's an outrage, but it's not an accident - because corporate lobbyists in Washington are writing our laws and putting their clients' interests ahead of what's fair for the American people. The men and women you represent haven't been getting a seat at the table when trade agreements are being negotiated, or tax policies are being written, or health care and pension laws are being designed because the special interests have bought every chair. That's not the America I believe in. That's not the America you believe in. And that's why when I'm President, we'll make sure Washington serves nobody's interests but the people's. You know, there's been a lot of talk in this campaign lately about who's ""in touch"" with the workers of Pennsylvania. Senator Clinton and Senator McCain are singing from the same hymn book, saying that I'm ""out of touch"" - an ""elitist"" - because I said a lot of folks are bitter about their economic circumstances. Now it may be that I chose my words badly. It wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. But when I hear my opponents, both of whom have spent decades in Washington, saying I'm out of touch, it's time to cut through their rhetoric and look at the reality. After all, you've heard this kind of rhetoric before. Around election time, the candidates can't do enough for you. They'll ""promise you anything, give you a long list of proposals and even come around, with TV crews in tow, to throw back a shot and a beer. But if those same candidates are taking millions of dollars in contributions from the PACs and lobbyists, ask yourself, who are they going to be toasting once the election is over? I'm the only candidate who doesn't take money from corporate PACs and lobbyists, and I'm here to tell you that you can count on me to stand up for you after this election, just as I've been standing up for workers all my life. That's why I'm running for President of the United States. Senator Clinton and Senator McCain question my respect for the workers of Pennsylvania. Well, let me tell you how I believe you demonstrate your respect. You do it by telling the truth and keeping your word, so folks can know that where you stand today is where you'll stand tomorrow. The truth is, trade is here to stay. We live in a global economy. For America's future to be as bright as our past, we have to compete. We have to win. Not every job that has left is coming back. And not every job lost is due to trade -automation has made plants more efficient so they can make the same amount of steel with few workers. These are the realities. I also don't oppose all trade deals. I voted for two of them because they have the worker and environmental agreements I believe in. Some of you disagreed with me on this but I did what I thought was right. That's the truth. But let me tell you what else I believe in: For America to win, American workers have to win, too. If CEO pay keeps rising, while the standard of living for their workers continues to decline, that's not a win for America. That's why I opposed NAFTA, it's why I opposed CAFTA, and it's why I said any trade agreement I would support had to contain real, enforceable standards for workers. That's why I believe the Permanent Normalized Trade agreement with China didn't do enough to ensure fairness and compliance. Now, you can have a debate about whether my position is right or wrong. But here's what you can't do. You can't spend the better part of two decades campaigning for NAFTA and PNTR for China, and then come here to Pennsylvania, and tell the steelworkers you've been with them all along. You can't say you are opposed to the Colombia Trade deal, while your key strategist is working for the Colombian government to get the deal passed. That's not respect. That's just more of the same old Washington politics. And we can't afford more of the same. We need real change, and that's what I'm offering. I'm offering a new, more transparent and more inclusive path on trade so we can help promote an integrated global economy where the costs and benefits are distributed more equitably. And it starts with a principle I've always believed in - that trade should work for all Americans. That's why we need to finally confront the issue of trade with China. As I've said before, America and the world can benefit from trade with China. But trade with China will only be good for you if China itself plays by the rules and acts as a positive force for balanced world growth. Seeing the living standards of the Chinese people improve is a good thing - good because we want a stable China, and good because China can be a powerful market for American exports. But too often, China has been competing in ways that are tilting the playing field. It's not just that China is following the path taken by so many other countries before it, and dumping goods into our market while not opening their own markets, something I've spoken out against. It's not just that they're violating intellectual property rights. They're also grossly undervaluing their currency, and giving their goods yet another unfair advantage. Each year they've had the chance, the Bush administration has failed to do anything about this. That's unacceptable. That's why I co-sponsored the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act. And that's why as President, I'll use all the diplomatic avenues open to me to insist that China stop manipulating its currency. We also have to make sure that whatever goods we're importing are safe for our families. We all saw the harm that was caused by lead toys from China that were reaching our store shelves. A few months ago, when I called for a ban on any toys that have more than a trace amount of lead, an official at China's foreign ministry said I was being ""unobjective, unreasonable, and unfair."" But I don't think protecting our children is ""unreasonable"" - I think it's our obligation as parents and as Americans. When it comes to trade, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. If countries are committed to reciprocity, if they are abiding by basic rules of the road, then we should welcome trade. Many poor countries need access to our markets and pose no threat to our workers. But what all trade agreements I negotiate as President will have in common is that they'll all put American workers first. We won't ignore violence against union organizers in Colombia, or the non-tariff barriers that keep U.S. cars out of South Korea. And we won't just negotiate fair trade agreements, we'll make sure they're being fully enforced. George Bush has been far too slow to press American rights. That's an outrage. When our trading partners sign an agreement with the Obama administration, you can trust that we'll hold them to it. Now, if we're serious about standing up for American workers around the world, we also have to fight for you here at home. That means passing universal health care and making sure every American has insurance you can take with you even if you lose your job, and that a college degree is within reach, even if you're not rich - because all our children should have the skills to compete in the global economy. And it also means protecting the rights of our workers. It's time we had a President who didn't choke saying the word ""union."" We need to strengthen our unions by letting them do what they do best - organize our workers. If a majority of workers want a union, they should get a union, no matter whether they're full-time, or part-time, or contract workers. And that is why I will fight for and why I intend to sign the Employee Free Choice Act when it lands on my desk in the White House. Here's what else I'll do: we'll pass the Patriot Employer Act that I've been working on since I got to the Senate - so we can stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and start giving them to companies that create good jobs with decent wages here in America. And to those who think that the decline in American manufacturing is inevitable; or that manufacturing has no place in a 21st century economy; we say right here and right now that the fight for manufacturing's future is the fight for America's future. And that's why we'll modernize our steel industry, strengthen our entire domestic manufacturing base, and open as many markets as we can to American manufactured goods when I'm President. We'll also make necessary long-term investments in job-growth. Back in the 1950's, Americans were put to work building the Interstate Highway system and that helped expand the middle class in this country. We need to show the same kind of leadership today. That's why I've called for a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank that will invest $60 billion over ten years and generate millions of new jobs. We can't keep standing by while our roads and bridges and airports crumble and decay. We can't keep running our economy on debt. For our economy, our safety, and our workers, we have to rebuild America. And we need to invest in green technology. We can't keep sending billions of dollars to foreign nations because of our addiction to oil. We should be investing in American companies that invest in American-manufactured solar panels and windmills, and in clean coal technology. That's why I've proposed investing $150 billion over the next ten years in the green energy sector. This will create up to five million new American jobs - and those are jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced. That's a promise that we are making not just to this generation of Americans, but to the next generation of Americans. And that's why this will be a priority in my administration. Now, I know some will say we can't afford all this. But let me just say this - if we can spend $10 billion a month rebuilding Iraq, we can spend $15 billion a year in our own country to put Americans back to work and strengthen the long-term competitiveness of our economy. So make no mistake - the American people have a choice in this election. We can talk about our economic problems with trade all we want, but unless we change the broken system in Washington, nothing else is going to change. We can talk all we want about respecting workers and their way of life, but unless we have a President you can trust to listen and put working Americans first, nothing is really going to change. And you can trust me. Because politics didn't lead me to working folks; working folks led me to politics. I was standing with American workers on the streets of Chicago twenty years ago, and the reason I'm here today is because I don't want to wake up one day many years from now and see that our companies are still getting hurt because foreign governments are still bending or breaking the rules, or that we're still standing idly by while American jobs get shipped overseas, or that we still haven't made the investments in infrastructure and in training our workers that we desperately need. The reason I'm here today is because I know what it's like to go to college on student loans, and see a mother get sick and worry that maybe she can't pay the bills. I know what it's like to have to scratch and work and claw to build a better life for your family. And I don't want to wake up many years from now and find that the American dream is still out of reach for too many Americans. The reason I'm here today is because I believe that if we can just put an end to the politics of division and distraction, and reclaim that sense that we all have a stake in each other, that we rise and fall as one nation; if we can just unite this country around a common purpose - black, white, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American; labor and management; Democrats, Republicans, and Independents - there's no obstacle we cannot overcome, no destiny we cannot fulfill. That's the fundamental truth I learned on the streets of Chicago. That's the idea at the heart of your Alliance for Manufacturing. And that's the opportunity we have in this election. There is a moment in the life of every generation where that spirit of unity and hopefulness has to come through if we're going to make our mark on history. This is our moment. This is our time. And if you will march with me, and organize with me, if you vote for me, then I promise you this: We will not just win this Democratic Nomination, we will win the general election and then together - you and I - we're going to change this country, and we're going to change this world. Thank you.","['A few months ago, when I called for a ban on any toys that have more than a trace amount of lead, an official at China\'s foreign ministry said I was being ""unobjective, unreasonable, and unfair.""

4,648,"Hillary Clinton,2008,OH",Dem,1,1.0,87.7585842,"Remarks at the Economic Summit in Zanesville, Ohio","Senator John Glenn: Thank you all for being here today and it is great to be back home in southeast Ohio, Annie and I grew up just down the road in New Concord, as most of you are aware. A real pleasure to be here today, I don't think if anything is more appropriate than having an economic summit here, not just because of this part of Ohio, but for the whole country; all the things we talk about are going to happen or not happen as the economy of the country dictates on what we can do for the future. That's why it's so important, and I know there are lots of people to give their opinions on this today, we welcome them all here to Ohio. It's my pleasure to introduce to you another person from the southern and southeastern part of Ohio, our great Governor Ted Strickland who was a minister, a psychologist, and a great new governor. Ted Strickland. Governor Ted Strickland: Thank you very much. As the governor of this wonderful state, I am so proud to have so many of our special guests with us today. I'm always happy to present Ohio and it's a greatness to people from outside of our state. As I have said many times, Ohio is a state that is a microcosm of America. We have incredible diversity in Ohio, and we celebrate that diversity. We have the wonderful foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and we have the great Lake Erie to the north; we have natural resources that are immense. We have racial and ethnic and cultural and religious, economic and geographic diversity like few other states. Ohio is a state with a proud history. Ohio and Ohioans, Senator, have not just built Ohio; Ohioans have built America, and we are proud of our history. But Ohio like many states is facing economic challenges. Too many of our families are facing the possibility of losing their homes through foreclosure. Too many of our workers have lost and are in danger of losing their jobs. Too many Ohioans, possibly as many as 1.3 million Ohioans are without health care insurance or coverage for health care needs. Too many of Ohioans are deployed in this conflict, more Ohio National Guard men and women, Senator, are deployed today then at any time since World War II. And we keep them in our hearts and in our prayers, and pray for a speedy recovery and a return to their home. Having said that, it is appropriate that the eyes of the nation are focused on Ohio; and that we are focused on the economy because I believe we have a candidate in Senator Clinton who understand Ohio and who understands the economic burdens facing our people and our state. I have traveled this state with her. I have sat with her as she has talked with real people facing real challenges. The reason that I am so excited about this event is because I believe Ohio wants to hear what is going to be done to create jobs, to expand opportunity and to make a decent life available to the people who live within the borders of our wonderful state. So thank you Senator for coming to this part of Ohio, and for traveling around all of Ohio. We look forward to your leadership today, in the weeks to come, and once you are in the White House. Welcome to Ohio. Senator Hillary Clinton: I am especially pleased to be here and especially to be with two of your native sons: Senator John Glenn who is so well known and honored across our country and the world, and your dynamic, effective governor Ted Strickland. This is a great opportunity for us to talk about not just the problems which people know pretty well for themselves, but what kind of solutions we can put together that will improve the economy, produce more jobs, enable us to keep the jobs that are here, increase the prosperity, make sure young people can stay home near their families in order to make a living, build a strong and prosperous middle class again. So I'm very excited about being here with distinguished guests. You'll meet them in a minute; they come from across Ohio and America to be right here in Zanesville, ""The Y Bridge City."" The mayor told me about the Y bridge, and I don't know how many Y bridges there are, but just another in- that's pretty impressive. Senator Glenn: This is the only one that cars can drive on, the other one is in Germany, and it is a pedestrian bridge. This is the only one in the world. Senator Hillary Clinton: Well that's a great distinction, congratulations. So we came to a place that is already quite unique, here in the Y Bridge City, to talk about the future. We're joined by distinguished guests from across the state as well as the country; elected officials, leaders from labor and business and education, and some hard-working Ohioans who you'll hear from. Now we may have come from different backgrounds but we're all here with the same purpose. And that is- when it comes to our economy, we know we can do a lot better. I have been across Ohio and across America for more than a year, actually going back about 16 years when I was first privileged to travel extensively in our country. This has been a great opportunity for me to hear firsthand from the people who are worried about their jobs because they've already seen those jobs be shipped over seas. They're worried about losing health care, because they've already seen that health care lost. They're worried about affording college because they've already seen too many young people from too many hard working families who are having a hard time affording the rising costs. They've already seen energy prices go up so fast over the last 7 years that the average family is paying more then $2,000 in energy today then they were in 2000. So people are living with the realities, and they're meeting them with the grit and determination that we would expect from Ohioans and Americans. But it's time that we had a president who is going to be a fighter and a champion for the American people again, who would get up everyday- Who would get up everyday and would say what are we going to do together, to the White House staff and the Cabinet and the government and the business and labor leaders in our country; what are we going to today to improve the lives of young hard working Americans? What are we going to do to rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class? That is my mission. That is what I would do as your president. I see a middle class comeback and I see it starting in places like Zanesville. It won't happen though just by hoping for it, it will only happen if we are determined and we have a plan and we implement it, and we see the results. And that's what I intend to do. I put forth my Economic Blueprint for the 21st century; it includes a lot of the specifics that I've been traveling around Ohio talking about. We're going to rein in the corporate special interests; we can take back $55 billion in tax giveaways that the Republicans and George Bush have handed out to the oil companies, to the drug companies, to the health insurance companies. We're going to say ""wait a minute Wall Street; you've had your president. Now we need a president for Main Street."" And we're going to make that happen. We're going to start investing in manufacturing again. I believe you can't have a strong economy unless you have a strong manufacturing sector. We can't rely on other countries to produce what the American military needs. So it's not only a question for our economy, it's a question for our national security. I believe we could create at least five million green collar jobs with clean renewable energy that would put Ohioans to work starting soon. I also know that if we invest in our infrastructure - more bridges, tunnels, roads, water systems, sanitation systems - we would put a lot of people to work and we would upgrade our infrastructure for the 21st century. In order to do that, we're going to close every tax loophole that still gives one penny of your tax dollars to any company that exports a job. Instead we're going to put that money to work here. We're going to address the home foreclosure and mortgage crisis, you'll hear a little bit about that today. Too many Ohioans are losing their homes; the numbers are staggering: 150,000 homes and foreclosures last year; 13,000 notices went out in January alone. These are a lot of hard working people who thought they were going to right thing. I've said we should have a moratorium on home foreclosures. Let's figure out as way to work out keeping people in their homes, instead of having vacant houses in neighborhoods that will decrease property values for everybody. I believe we need universal health care, no exceptions, no excuses, and I know we can achieve that. We do need affordable college again, something that is one of my highest priorities. It is now more expensive for a young person to go to college in America than it was thirty and forty years ago, that's wrong. Through a combination of tax credit and aid, reining in the student loan companies that have been acting like predatory lenders, we're going to go back to direct lending to help students afford to go to college. And if they come out with debt, if they are willing to do a public service job like teaching or nursing or law enforcement, we will forgive their debt so that they can be debt free. We're going to start supporting our unions again, because when unions were strong we had a strong middle class. It's not an accident. It's time that working people had a president on their side again. Finally, we are going to have trade that lifts up our families: pro-worker, pro-environment, pro-American trade. That's going to be one of my highest priorities. I know that NAFTA has hurt a lot of Ohio's families. That's why I have taken action; I'm the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to fix NAFTA. And I will also crack down on China's unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation which gives them big advantages over our companies and our country. We're not just here to talk about what I want to do; I want to hear what people have to say about what we can do together. We have an extraordinary group of people, and I want to hear about the challenges that they face. I'm going to ask each person to introduce him or herself because I want your advice. I will be a president, just as I have been a senator, who listens. I think you learn more when you're listening than when you are talking. And what is necessary for Zanesville may not be the same as Toledo, may not be the same as San Antonio, may not be the same as Chicago or New York. So we need to look closely at what will work in communities across Ohio and America. I think that we've got some great opportunities here. We hear a lot about the problems and they are serious but I believe for every problem, there is at least one solution. We just have to start acting like Americans again and roll up our sleeves and actually solve our problems. No more whining, no more finger pointing, let's get to work. I'd like to start our discussion today by hearing from the Ohioans who have graciously taken their time out to join us. I want to start with Dave Cimperman. Dave and I met at Grace's Grill in Parma last week. David has worked at General Motors for more than forty years, and he sees the economy from the front lines of the work force. I want to ask Dave if you can share with us what you see as the key economic challenges facing you and your family. Dave Cimperman: Senator, one of the big things that I see is the universal health care. General Motors is paying each, is charging $1,600 per vehicle because of the health care that they're giving us. They're competing with automobile companies in Japan... It's time we got one. Senator Hillary Clinton: Well, obviously I agree with Dave and I'm really happy he mentioned this because there are two very important reasons that we should have universal health care. The first is that it is the morally right thing to do. I do not believe people in our country should be denied access to quality, affordable health care. And the second reason is there is no doubt in my mind, as Dave just said, we have lost jobs over the last 20 years and increasingly over the last seven years where we've lost, in Ohio alone, 200,000 jobs in manufacturing while George Bush has been president. And one of the main reasons is health care costs. Because as Dave said, General Motors has to put $1,600 of its money into ever car, imagine what a competitive disadvantage that is. Other countries don't impose that burden on their companies, and particularly on their manufacturers. So it's economically necessary for us to achieve universal health care. Dave, you've been working for General Motors for quite some time; are there other issues in addition to universal health care that we have to address? Dave Cimperman: We would like to see a more even trade policies. There are a number of them that we are allowed limited number of vehicles to countries and we take up a lot more coming into this country. I must mention, Senator, that the same forty years I worked for General Motors, I was also a United Auto Workers, in the union, I'm still in the union. I'm giving you my opinions, not the union's opinions. But there are many, many members who feel the same way I do, and are backing you. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you, well, I've worked with the UAW for years, and I know that they share your commitment to universal health care and to leveling the playing field so that we have a chance to compete. American workers are the best in the world, we're most productive. We just need to be unshackled so we can compete fairly and that's what we are going to try to achieve, so thank you very much Dave. Now I'd like to welcome Robert Landry and Beth Dlabay. I met them in Dayton, and they've driven all the way from Dayton to be with us today. On Christmas Eve, Robert and Beth lost their home in a home foreclosure. I know what a shock that was to them because I heard them talk about it. But I want to really personalize these statistics. Millions of people have lost their homes in the last several years. The Bush administration has taken little to no action to try to prevent it. I have a plan to try to stop the home foreclosure crisis. But I want you to hear from Robert and Beth what it means when you're actually faced with that. Robert, why don't you start; can you tell us how this happened to you? And then you and Beth tell us how you're managing now. Robert Landry: well, you know, it just starts where you're just doing your thing. You're working, you got a decent job, you're paying your bills on time. All of the sudden you notice one of your payments isn't taken out. You call the mortgage company up and you ask them what's going on. Then you find out, they say ""it's lost, just wait."" Okay. Then the next thing you know, but what you don't know is you're being marked late, they're hitting your credit and you find out that you've got a predatory loan that's going to reset in a couple months. The next time you try to pay it on time, they do the same thing, they mark you late. Then you cannot refinance with a good rate. And you start freaking out. This is your home; your grandkids depend on you; you've got a good job. This can't happen to me. There's laws and you call, you do everything. You write the governor and- not this governor- Governor Ted Strickland: Thank you. Robert Landry: And he gives me a letter saying it's not within his jurisdiction. I didn't know the law, but I thought well maybe he could make a phone call or something. I don't know. Maybe because it's not just me, it's happening to a lot of people. You fill a loan, the bottom drops out of your whole life. You think your doing to right thing, and then it's all over. They give you a number to the Bar Association; you get a real estate lawyer. You go in there, they say, ""well I can research it for four hours and write a nasty letter for $800,"" and you've already paid some late- they say you were late, they say you have late fees. Then you call again. You've got records that your right, you've got everything, you did, your bank gave you print outs for months. You present that to them and they say ""no, you're still late, no, you're still late, you still owe us another $1,000 from when you first started paying two years ago"" or something. You just don't know what to do. The bottom line is, you don't know what to do and you're lost. I finally got a hold of fair housing, Miami Valley Fair Housing, and they're non-profit and they helped us out. But they made us go through a rigorous interview to get involved in their process. At least after months of them making me go through classes to make sure I could pay my bills, when I already was, they finally agreed to take us on. But they sent out RESPA letters for me. You're required by law to answer these letters, you're required to stop hitting a person's credit and you have to tell them or every penny went. Well, they don't answer them because it's a small fine. It's insignificant compared to the value of your home. So, long story short, we just needed someone to be there for us and we felt lost. We voted, you know, that's the only thing you can do is vote for change and we voted for Governor Strickland. I almost feel like it worked, my one vote worked because I'm sitting right next to him. Senator Hillary Clinton: Beth, do you want to add anything to what Robert said? Beth Dlabay: It was just really difficult because, in the meantime our granddaughter that was living with us had to undergo open heart surgery and the lender's attorney did not want to wait on us to sign the papers, they just wanted us to sign the papers and get out. Well, we had to travel from Dayton to Cincinnati and find somebody else to take care of our other two grandchildren because she had to have a pulmonary valve put in. They didn't care. If it hadn't been for the Miami Valley Fair Housing Center I really don't know what we would have done. And there's too many people, they can't even help them. There's a lot more people. We got out of it, we're fine, our granddaughter's fine, we're going to make it. We found another house to live in. we got the kids Christmas, we made sure we had a tree up Christmas Eve even though we had to be out. I got everything ready for them and when we went and got them, they had Christmas. That's the important thing, I just wish that Miami Valley Fair Housing Center could help more people like us but they need the funding; they don't get it. I don't want any other family to have to go what we went through, ever. Senator Hillary Clinton: When I first met Robert and Beth in Dayton they had one of their grandsons with them and it was so impressive to me the way Robert explained how he'd always paid his bills; he was raised in a family where you're supposed to pay your bills. He sent in the check, and this is one of the many scams that these lenders get away with- where they claim you're late. You can show when you sent it, and they say well we didn't receive it. And you of course can't control when they claim they received it. Then they use those late payments to force a higher interest rate on you. Force you into refinancing. It's just a terrible abuse that does need to be cracked down on. And Robert is rightâthe fine is so small it's worth a lot of these companies just gambling. So I think there needs to be criminal consequences and much tougher fines to rein in these lenders. As Beth said, we need more help to the organizations that are trying to save people's homes and I have a proposal where we would put money into doing just that, help communities that are facing a high foreclosure rate. As the governor knows so well, Ohio has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country, I think it's like number nine in the whole country. This is a big issue that affects so many families here. We're so lucky to have Governor Strickland with us because he's been working hard to turn around Ohio, and he has lots of great ideas about how he's going to improve the economic lives of people across the state. So Governor, I'd like to ask you to tell us what you think are the three most pressing economic challenges that you face as the governor of Ohio. Governor Ted Strickland: Senator, we have huge budget challenges. We passed a budget not many months ago unanimously. Every Republican and every Democrat in the Senate voted for it and all but one member of the House of Representatives voted for it; although both chambers are controlled by the Republican Party, we were able to work together to fashion a budget that identified priorities for Ohio. We wanted a budget that would provide health care coverage for all of our children, we wanted a budget that would freeze college tuition after ten straight years of annual increases in tuition of 9%, every year for ten years, making Ohio 47% more costly for our young people to go to an Ohio public college or university than was the national average. We did some really good things in a very bipartisan way. But the economy's had a downturn. The national economy is affecting what's happening here in Ohio. And so I've been faced, just within the last few weeks, of having to make some very painful decisions because we've had to cut over $730 million out of the budget. These decisions affect real people, real families and real children. So, if I were to give you the three things that I think could be most helpful to Ohio and, quite frankly, these are the reasons that I'm supporting you. I've known you for 15 years but I wouldn't support you if I didn't think you were the best candidate for Ohio. In Ohio, as is the case in many other states, 21 states are now having to go back and revisit their budgets. 21 states and that number is growing. So, we have huge rising Medicaid expenditures in Ohio. So if we had a heath care system that could provide health care coverage to everyone in a plan-fu, rational way, it would make such a huge difference. I say to people ""can you imagine what life would be like if all of us had access to affordable health care? Can we imagine the burden that would be taken off the shoulders of moms and dads knowing that their loved ones had access to health care coverage? What it would do to our businesses in terms of making them more competitive if they didn't have this burden?"" So Senator, I believe, and I'm going to sound very political here but I'm going to do it because I think it's absolutely true, I think you are the only candidate that can help us realize a Democratic dream, an American dream; since the days of Harry Truman we've tried to get universal health care coverage for the American people and we've been unable to. We are finally at a place where that can happen. The physicians, the health care providers now know it's necessary. The business leaders in our state now know it's necessary. I think things are coming together. What we need right now is a president that is committed to getting it done. I am convinced that the one thing that could be helpful to all Ohioans and to our overall economy is what you will do as presidentâthat's bring universal health care coverage to our people. The second thing we need, and I'll be quick, we need jobs. We need jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs. And I'm proposing a $1.7 billion bond package that will create jobs in Ohio but I know that you're working on that at the federal level. You understand that we've got to start investing in America. We've got to start building the infrastructure that is necessary to repair our roads and bridges and sewer systems and water systems to help local communities build our country. That will create jobs and so that's the second thing. And the third thing is certainly education because education is the ultimate hope for our people and making sure we have a good, high-quality educational experience for our children from their youngest years through even graduate work and the adult worker up to the time of retirement. These are the three things that I think Ohio needs. I think they're the things that you as president will accomplish. If we can get that done, you become president and you do those three things for Ohio, we're going to say you were a pretty good president. Senator Hillary Clinton: Well, you will have a partner in the White House to really tackle all of these challenges because they're so important. And you've given us a lot to think about. One of the issues that I'd like to get into because it's related to what governor Strickland said is both an economic opportunity and a way of giving people a real shot at the American dreamâthat's housing. What are we going to do to provide more housing that's affordable? And what are we going to do to deal with this home foreclosure crisis? Someone whom I admire so much is current governor of New Jersey, Jon Corzine, who's with us. He is also a former United States Senator with whom I served. And he was before that the Chief Executive Officer of one of the largest, most successful financial firms in the world, Goldman Sachs. So he's had a lot of experience in both the public and the private sector. So Governor Corzine, two questions â specifically with respect to the housing crisis, how would you have approached a financial challenge like this when you were in the private sector, and what steps do you think we should take both at the state and the federal level? And then in addition, same question to you that I asked Governor Strickland, the three big challenges that you're coping with as Governor, Governor Corzine. Governor Jon Corzine: Thank you Senator Clinton and it's great to be here in Ohio and be with the great Senator Glenn, Governor Strickland and all the citizens. I have to say, Senator Clinton, the stories that I've heard already from the people here and the problems that's Governor Strickland outlined sound like I'm back home in New Jersey. We have people that struggle every day to make ends meet on health care issues, on housing issues; they're worried about their jobs. We're actually just closing right now the last General Motors auto production plant in our state. We had five auto production plants 15, 20 years ago. We are going to have no auto production at all. So these are real issues. The housing crisis that we have in the countryâforeclosures, predatory lending, facts that people got into, home ownership under false pretenses by people who sold them more than they could actually carry are things that you were talking about when I was a United States Senator. Predatory lending was one of the things that we worked on together. This is not something that Senator Clinton didn't recognize before that's why I know she's the most qualified individual to be the president. And I'm an old washed up finance person but, I'll tell you, if you got in trouble in a corporate situation you'd go to your bank and you'd talk about having a moratorium on debt payments. You'd negotiate a new loan agreement. Senator Clinton has talked about that for the American people that are having trouble with their mortgages. We need a freeze on the rates of subprime adjustable lending that Robert talked about. You can't- we're better to actually get Robert to be able pay something than nothing. Robert Landry: 14.9. Governor Jon Corzine: It's ridiculous, its ridiculous and it needs to be dealt with. The second thing is we need to have a moratorium on foreclosures altogether so that people can catch up and make a difference. Senator Clinton proposed these things six months ago, not now. This is something she recognized before the housing prices became a huge problem. I think that speaks to the kind of president she'd be, not only about this issue, but a lot of issues, because she has the foresight to see how we ought to be addressing them. I have to tell you as a governor, she's also got another element of her plan where she wants to put $30 billion into funds that actually would get distributed to Governor Strickland or New Jersey or states across- so that we can actually work with families more closely. We're all struggling with our budgets but if the federal government doesn't offer a partnership it won't happen. Also I can tell you that both from my business background and from my life as New Jersey's governor, I can tell you that the plans that she's laid down are practical, they show real solutions, they're far more than words. They are the real deal. This is how you get out of this crisis. Senator Clinton is onto the right track. Senator Hillary Clinton: As Governor Corzine said, jobs are a problem everywhere. Some places are harder hit than other places but the issue really is how do we keep the jobs we have and how do we create more jobs? I've been pleased the last several days to have a number of New Yorkers travelling across Ohio talking about the work we've done together to try to keep and grow jobs. I am grateful that I've been a partner with people like Gary Douglas who's the very active president of one of our Chambers of Commerce in New York who has been just focused on keeping jobs and bringing jobs to his part of the state. It's really important that we zero in on what works. How are we going to keep and grow jobs? I'd like to turn now to your Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher. He is the Director of the Department of Development here in Ohio and Lieutenant Governor Fisher is on the cutting edge of trying to bring advanced clean energy jobs to Ohio. This is an issue that I am both passionate about and very excited so I would love to hear from Lieutenant Governor Fisher about the steps you are taking to try to create clean energy jobs in Ohio. Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher: Senator Clinton, Governor Strickland has given me the double honor not just to serve as his Lieutenant Governor but also to serve as his Director of Economic Development and so I wake up every single morning focused on one thing and one thing onlyâand that is jobs and economic growth so that every Ohioan, no matter where they live, no matter who they are, has the economic opportunity that many of us have had. I, like Governor Strickland, have had the opportunity to know you for many years; in my case 17 years. And I know the governor and I want more than anything else a partner in the White House who not only will come up with the solutions but understands the problems because she has actually dealt with them in her capacity not just as an elected official but as a private individual. Cities like Zanesville and Cleveland and Toledo are not new to you because you've been travelling to our cities for 16 years and I can tell you that I believe that our greatest strength in our state is the fact that we, under Governor Strickland's leadership, are marrying our proud past with an even more dynamic future. Let me explain what I mean. Ohio is known for many things but I would say more than anything it is known for three things. First, that we are the seed-bed of invention, entrepreneurship, innovation, and exploration. The best example of exploration being none other than U.S. Senator John Glenn. And I think you know that these days that we measure the strength of our economy not just by the height of our smoke stacks or the strength of our backs but also by the depth of our innovation and the strength of our ideas, which is why what we are doing is taking advantage of our strong manufacturing base. We are the third largest manufacturing state in our country. And why we are taking advantage of our agricultural base, as the largest economic force in our state, and actually converting that into the future. Examples? We're going from bicycles, to bio fuels. We're going from gliders to turbine engines and lunar rockets. We're going from cellulose and cord and soy beans to ethanol and other biofuels. We're going from a manufacturing base to wind turbines. Just this afternoon I spoke to a CEO of a company called Minster Machine where Governor Strickland recently visited. This is a company that began as a blacksmith's shop 111 years ago. They are known as a strong but small manufacturing company. The CEO, a year ago, after Governor Strickland was elected, and I think primarily because Governor Strickland was elected, decided to look into doing something new. They have started a division of Minster Machine called Minster Wind. And they are right now, with our help and with the help of other partners, creating a wind division and taking advantage of the fact that Ohio has got this supply chain of manufacturers that can make the gearboxes and all the bearings and all the components of windmills. But they want to do more. They actually want to make the windmill itself. They don't just want to be the component parts. Today we have over 60 manufacturing companies that are helping supply wind power around the world. And I believe that under Governor Strickland's leadership and the $1.7 billion jobs plan that he recently announced, we will end up setting aside, I believe, more funds in our state, Senator, than any other state in the countryâ perhaps even more than New Jersey and New York. For alternative advanced energy, we've already set aside $1 billion in low interest loans to private companies wanting to get into the wind business. And if the Governor's plan passes this November, and I hope with all of your support we'll have not only a new president of the United States by the name of Hillary Clinton, but that we'll also have a new jobs plan that will set aside â but that we'll also have a jobs plan in November that will set aside $250 million above and beyond what we've already set aside for bringing Ohio into the 21st century and moving Ohio to the head of the class. Senator Hillary Clinton: That's exciting. Very exciting, Lee. You know, other countries have a head start on us. Denmark gets a lot of its energy, now, from wind. As a result it's been manufacturing a lot of the windmills and obviously exporting them. Germany is getting a great deal of economic benefit from investing in solar power and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. And they've done exactly what you're describing. The government said ""look, we've got to help start the market for this. We've got to have the low interest loans. We have to make the investments. We have to train the work force."" That's why I've been a strong proponent of green collar jobs and passed the first training program to start getting people equipped to do this work. But I believe that we can create at least five million new jobs in America over the next ten years. And that's the kind of visionary work that you're doing. Continuing our focus on jobs, which is the key here, I'd like to turn to Gary Dwyer who is the Secretary Treasurer for the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council. Gary Dwyer is a 33 year member of the Iron Workers. He currently represents 90,000 union construction workers in Ohio. Gary, we would love to hear your views about the best ways to create good jobs here in the state. Secretary Treasurer Gary Dwyer: Thank you very much Senator. And when you say the title, I'm from the Ohio State Building Trade. And that's what we like to do: build. We like to build buildings, bridges, everything. I want to tell you four brief stories if you let me about what happened to me in my personal career. When I joined the Ironworkers Local 17 in Cleveland, Ohio. At local we had 400 ironworkers in the steel mills every single day. 400. Today I don't even think sometimes you can even find 4 ironworkers in those mills. Where did those jobs go? They're not up in Cleveland anymore. I recently went up to Clevelandâ I've been away for over three years- and one of the biggest jobs that was going when I left was the job of dismantling the steel mill and sending that steel mill to China. It really saddens me when I go by that old vacant spot where the steel mill used to be and now it's a retail store. I think we have enough of these strip shopping malls in different places and we need to get back to our real manufacturing jobs, and our base. One of the highlights of my career as an ironworker was I was in charge of the children's Christmas party every year and I did it for over 12 years. It was my job to go out and find union made toys for my 2,000 members' children. I would come out and worked very hard and my kids thought I was the greatest thing in the world when I would go and buy hundreds of different toys. After a couple years the list of union made toys started getting smaller. So finally I had to go to the second alternative and that was ""Made in America."" And I did that for about three or four years and the catalogue that used to be that big started getting down and down and down. Some of the names that you know like Tonka, Etch-a-Sketch, all these things that I had bought for many, many years were no longer made in the United States. They were gone. Once again, I told you, we like to build things. Other effects when the jobs go out of town, we don't build new buildings and put those companies in, those manufacturing, my people, we just don't work anymore. One of the saddest stories I have. We built a building, a brand new state of the art building up in Cleveland, Senator, and I'm sure you've heard the name Mr. Coffee. No longer than we even built that building and the next thing, it was gone. They moved to Mexico. After they were in Mexico I think they moved to a couple other countries and then a couple other countries. The price kept going down, what they were willing to pay for that wage. But you know what? When you go in the store to buy that coffee maker, I've never seen the price go down. It's pretty sad. I'm not sure what happened to all those buildings that are sitting vacant. I used to live on the east side of Cleveland and I can tell you all these horror stories. The stories that add Addressograph, Multi-craft, Fisher Price, Coit, all the different jobs are sitting up there vacant so when you build things and you have all these vacant buildings it's not a good thing. We have a lot of good hopes with you coming on. We look forward to building our manufacturing base. And I can tell you that things are changing around and it's changing in Ohio because I had the opportunity - and this is quite unique here - I had the privilege and honor to go with Lieutenant Governor Fisher to Japan for a trade mission. When was the last time that a labor official got to go? Myself and two other labor officials got an opportunity to go. And the thing that I came out with, when we were competing for jobs and the Lieutenant Governor was up there talking, everyone was saying ""you've got to come here I'm from this business, I'm from this business."" He always said the same thing ""I'm here with the largest delegate of business and labor and we want your business here in Ohio."" I want to thank you very much for that. We're all in this together. And if we don't think like that, if we don't continue to have these discussions, we're all going to be going down the wayside by ourselves. We have started labor managements; we've been talking about them from day one now. How do we stay competitive and how do we start talking? Senator, thank you for listening. I cannot tell you how excited I was to be invited to this panel and then can actually- and please do me a favor, when you're president, keep these conversations going. Senator Hillary Clinton: Yes, yes. Great idea. DWYER: In closing I want to tell a couple of stories. I hate to say it. I was not only a builder but I was a Marine. So I come from two very highly whatever you want to call it. But every year my Ironworker International would have a training out in San Diego, California and I was privileged enough to go out for training. Just a little gut check, I would go out to a little place over there called Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and I would see what these young men and women protecting our country, and I would go there and I would just suck in the gut, get a little taller and I felt so good. Then one day, probably about four years ago, I went there for my regular, to go buy my Marine Corps memorabilia and everything. I went into the store, I bought four shirts, I brought a couple back. I looked at the label. And, I'll tell you, it saddened me because that shirt was not only made in America at one time by a company called Fruit of the Loom, but now was being made in Vietnam and was being sold in that Marine Corps recruit depot. And I have not ever worn another shirt with a Marine Corps emblem on ever since then. If we can not buy American, fix America first, there's something wrong. Thank you very much for having me here. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you. Thank you so much Gary both for your leadership and your passion about what you do because you're absolutely right. We have to create a new ethic of patriotism. We've got to start being focused on making sure that our country, which has given so many blessings to many of us, continues to be able to do so for years and years and years to come. Unfortunately we have a lot of CEOs of major corporations today in America who seem to have forgotten how fortunate they are that they have been given the gift of American citizenship and support for them and their families. So we're going to call on them too to be part of the solution and to work, as you pointed out, hand in hand to try to get back those jobs and do it in a way that we can be very excited about what it's going to mean for our kids and grandkids going forward. So thank you so much. Now we're going to turn to Lieutenant Governor David Patterson from New York. David is a great friend of mine. He is an extraordinary public servant and leader. He has been working very hard on a lot of the same issues that affect Ohio in upstate New York. I often say that upstate New York has a lot of similarity to Ohio; our cities, our small towns, our countryside, our farmland. And I've been working very hard to create more jobs in upstate New York and David has as well, working with Governor Spitzer. David I'd like you to perhaps describe what you're doing and maybe some of he positive changes and successes that you're seeing. Lieutenant Governor David Patterson: Senator, I was thinking of exactly what you're saying when I was reading in the Columbus Dispatch this morning about a company that's going to pay workers $16 an hour and create 100 jobs in Lancaster, Ohio in Fairfield County. And they are going to begin that immediately. And we find in New York this same issue as in Ohio. Ohio lost over one quarter of its manufacturing jobs, over 200,000 workers out of work since the year 2000. New York has lost 189,000 manufacturing jobs going back to the same time period. What Governor Spitzer is doing is the same thingâ getting companies to come into the state, going around. You get well the same way you got sick, a little at a time, trying to build back the workforce in upstate New York which is a region struggling for survival. Its economy is such that almost 30% of our college graduates move out of New York to greater opportunities. But I think, Senator, what you have talked aboutâ can I call you Madame President? Senator Hillary Clinton: No, not yet, David. Not yet. Lieutenant Governor David Patterson: I'm sorry, I'm just practicing. I just think that your ideas, just like what Governor Strickland is doing here in Ohio with the research and technology corridor on Route 115 in Columbus, trying to take our educational institutions like Ohio State and then use that to create new jobs. We do it in New York as well. We do it with medical and scientific research. The federal government has shut the door on medical and scientific research but also with green collar jobs. What you were talking about, that Germany is the world leader in solar power, they have no more sunlight than the United States. The greatest amount of wind power jobs in this country were created last year. They actually created as many jobs in the succeeding four years. I think Senator, President, whatever we can do to help you when you get to the White House is just the fact that the states are almost fighting among themselves and the jobs overseas. We need you to bring American jobs back to our shores and we need America to prosper in the way that can from the new technologies, what would be the new discoveries that can help us. In our state, in 1820 we had 3% of the country's population and we did about 3% of the country's economic development. We built the Erie Lackawanna Railroad and we built the Erie Canal. In those 20 years, New York State went to doing almost half of the economic development in the country and 12% of the people lived there. The people moved where the jobs were. Now they are moving away and we are struggling more than other states. States like Ohio and New Jersey with Governor Corzine and all the other states have great ideas, we just need that extra help from Washington and we will succeed. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you so much, David. I think the two examples David gave of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad and the Erie Canal are really important because you heard Governor Strickland talk about the bond that he is going to bring to you as voters. When the governor of New York, back in the beginning of the 19th century said that he wanted to build a canal from New York City to Buffalo, people thought he was crazy. In fact, his name was Clinton and they called it 'Clinton's Ditch' and 'Clinton's Folly' and all kinds of derogatory terms. But he was a visionary and he said we can't just keep doing what we are doing, it's not working. We have to make big investments to make big changes. That's what Abraham Lincoln did with the intercontinental railroad in the middle of the Civil War. It's what he did when he said we're going to have Land Grant colleges. We didn't even know we were going to keep the union together but he was looking at the future. It is what Franklin Roosevelt did with his work program and what Dwight Eisenhower did with the interstate highway system and President Kennedy with the space program. You could look and see how at critical moments in our history, our leaders made bets on the future and it's time for us to do that again and there are always naysayers and people who said, ""Oh, we don't want to do that."" Ask yourself, what's the alternative? We can't keep doing what we are doing; we've got to get really focused on how we're going to have a competitive economy, creating new jobs. I know we can do that. I turn now to someone representing one of our oldest continually operating companies in America located in upstate New York, Corning, Inc., a company that started our making glass and now makes a wide variety of products. It has always exported but has continually had to reinvent itself. If it had just stayed in the glass business, it wouldn't be in business. So we have to do the same for our country. Christine Pambianchi is the Vice President of Human Resources at Corning. I've been working very closely with them over the last several years because they are the largest employer in a part of New York and obviously we want to make sure those jobs stay and grow more jobs. Christine is here today to offer some insight into how one American company is adjusting in the face of new economic challenges. Christine? Christine Pambianchi: Thank you so much, Senator Clinton. I'm very happy to be here today to tell you about the great work that Senator Clinton has done in partnership with my company Corning Incorporated to create jobs in upstate New York and not just jobs, but green jobs. I think when you hear my story you will see that this is an example that supports the plans that she is laying out that could be done on a national scale were she to be elected president which obviously I am very hopeful for. We are a glass and ceramic research company, as Senator Clinton mentioned. We've been around for 150 years and we invent materials. One of the materials that we invented is a type of ceramic that can be made into a filter that will actually clean the emissions from diesel vehicles. In the United States today we have approximately 11 million heavy duty diesel trucks and school buses that are on the road and the government has passed requirements for cleaner emissions of those. However, if we don't retrofit the 11 million vehicles in the existing fleet, we will not have a clean fleet until the year 2030. As Senator Clinton got to know our country and some of our technologies, she also became aware of and championed causes around clean air and in particular, school buses. Our children ride around in school buses and are very exposed to these harmful carcinogens and Senator Clinton championed legislation in Washington with the EPA and put a program in place called the Clean School Bus USA Program. This program set aside monies that school districts could apply for to retrofit their school buses. This directly supported us being able to create 400 jobs in our diesel manufacturing facility in upstate New York. We have $800 million invested in inventing this business and building a manufacturing plant to manufacture it. These are really good manufacturing jobs in upstate New York and that business has continued to grow. In addition to the initial program with the EPA for school buses, Senator Clinton has supported retrofit programs for the heavy duty diesel manufacturers and two other bills in Congress and that has led to the continued growth of the retrofit business and the continued vibrancy of our business to provide these environmentally friendly products. That's one, I think, very concrete example. Another story I wanted to share with you today is we do invent things. Another thing that we invented that you may not all know is that we actually invented optical fiber and optical fiber is actually glass. We invented that product and we sell that product around the world. We have a large manufacturing operation in Wilmington, North Carolina. With recent growth we've been able to re-open our facility in Concord, North Carolina. But in the last few years we came under attack in the world market and in particular in China and local companies in China manufacturing fiber sought to have our product either barred from entry to the Chinese market or levied with significant tariffs, upwards in the neighborhood of 46%. That would've made it impossible for us to enter that market and sell our product there. We obviously were defending ourselves against those potential harmful acts and we called on Senator Clinton who came to our aid. She didn't just follow with words, she actually gave written correspondence with the Chinese government, met with them in person on our behalf and we actually prevailed and the Chinese government sided with us and found that our products should be allowed to enter those markets free from those very harmful tariffs. That again sustained our investment in our research center and our business that we have in optical fiber. We have a large research center in upstate New York. We have 1,500 employees that work in both technician, as well as PhD scientist positions inventing products. If you look at the details of Senator Clinton's stimulus package, she calls for continuing to invest in research and innovation and then translate that into manufacturing jobs that we can keep in the United States. Hopefully these stories are good examples of what she's done for her current constituency base and I think she would be able to do for us on a national scale. Finally, there is a lot of job about health care. You'll hear from other people as well as the Senator on that subject, but it's a topic that is very important to employers, as well. As we look to keep jobs in America and have America be competitive in the manufacturing environment, it's very challenging as an employer to figure out how to combat double digit growth in your health care costs every year and then try to keep your manufacturing costs balanced so you can be the leader in your markets on a global scale. I think that Senator Clinton understands these issues from a citizen and an employer and the perspective of what I think is best for the country and I think that she is best equip to work with us on that issue. Finally, I would just like to offer that I am actually a life-long New York resident. I was born in the Bronx, educated in upstate New York and now I work in New York and I would just like to say that as a citizen of New York I am so proud of what Senator Clinton has done for us as our senator and would just offer personal testimonial of what I think she could do for the country, so thank you. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you Christine. It's been really a great experience working with Corning because they are committed to their community and they are committed to our country. I haven't had that experience with every company. I've had to have some pretty strong words with some CEOs who were going to move jobs out of New York even though the plan where those jobs were being performed was profitable. And the people working in the plant, some union, some non-union, they'd all gone the extra mile. They'd cut back on all of the ways they could to be more efficient. They changed work rules. Everybody felt like they were on the team together and productivity went up and profit went up. The company said we could make more money elsewhere. That, to me, is just so unfair. What we've got to do as we level the playing field is eliminate every single tax break that people still get for exporting jobs. Then we've got to start putting some tax breaks into supporting new jobs and give people the incentives to keep those jobs right here. As you heard from Christine and from others, we keep coming back to health care costs and we do it for a reason. We cannot continue to pay what we pay for health care and remain a competitive economy with a strong and prosperous middle class. We just can't. The average American family pays $12,000 a year for a family policy. Some pay out of their pocket, some it's shared with the employer, some get more of a share than others. $12,000 a year. I feel very strongly about this issue, as you know, but I'd like to bring some additional perspectives to bear here. One of the people that came today you will recognize her company because she is the CEO of Weight Watchers. Florine Mark is in the business of helping people lead healthier lives. But she's also struggling to help companies provide health care to their employees. So Florine, would you give us your perspective as a CEO and as a health advocate, what do you think are the most important things we should do to fix our health care system? Florine Mark: First of all let me say what an honor it is to be sitting here with you and everyone around this table and when I listen to the governors' talk about their states, Michigan has been in a recession for a while. We're the home of GM and Chrysler and Ford and when I hear that there are no more GM plants in your state Governor, it really pains all of us. And we are working very hard. We have a fabulous governor, Governor Jennifer Granholm who is working so hard and trying to bring in jobs and trying to work with the Big Three and if I could just do a little commercial, please buy American. Please buy American. Health care. I want to take a different slant at it because I'm really coming from preventative medicine and what makes me so excited about Senator Clinton is that she really believes in preventative medicine and that's the key to it all. That's going to lower our health care costs. She has a plan which is so very, very, very important. Do you know how many kids are failing school because they are fat? Do you know how many kids are not getting to school because they are fat? Do you know how many kids are dying, not just grownups but kids who are dying. I met a 14 year old the other day who was 100 lbs overweight with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, all of these terrible things and nobody seems to be doing anything about it because the kids are sitting in front of the computers. They are not really being motivated to get up. And the first ting that we cut out when we have to cut out our school systems is physical education. So education is extremely, extremely important. I want to tell you that I'm the mother of five, the stepmother of two â that makes me a mother of seven and the grandmother of 24 gorgeous grandchildren. Several of them are in college, I have one that is a third year medical student and one that is just starting veterinary school and I am so privileged to be able to help these kids and help pay for their schooling. You have no idea how high it is. I think my medical student is $65,000 per year to go to medical school. Just think of how many potential Einstein's and Clintons and Jonas Salk's and Edison's that are out there that will never have an opportunity to go to school, to go to college. Therefore your plan on education excites me, makes me feel safe because when I think of President, excuse me, Senator Clinton, I think of the word safe because I know she is kind, good, smart, tough â she is brilliant, she is nurturing, she has a sympathetic part about her, an empathetic part about her â who will do for the country what she is going to do for my children and my grandchildren, hopefully my great grandchildren and my great-great grandchildren. So education, preventative medicine, getting people to understand how to eat, how to be healthier; that's very important. Education is very important and I'll tell you one other thing. I will only feel safe if this woman becomes president of the United States of America. I feel that if God forbid, that phone, that red phone in the White House rings, I want her there to answer it. Senator Hillary Clinton: We're going to put a moratorium on compliments. I'm very grateful for those very kind remarks, but I really feel that what you've done in emphasizing prevention is key. We can save money if we actually prevent disease, there is a lot of evidence, increasing evidence that if people in health insurance plans are encouraged to quit smoking, to get more exercise, to eat right, to take their vitamins, have their exams, to do what is necessary to make sure they are healthy. We will actually save money as well as lives. That's what Florine tries to do every single day but we have to do it on a broader scale and we need everybody involved. Business, labor, government, everybody has got to be focused on this. So that we will be part of the bully pulpit because I remember when I was in grade school and junior high, we used to have these President's Physical Fitness Awards. I don't know if anybody remembers those? Remember that? Once a year we'd be taken to the gym and we'd have to run and jump and do all sorts of things. I was never very good at it, but I was there. And even though I wasn't very good at it I would get this certificate and it was signed by the president and I really thought President Kennedy was sitting in the White House signing each and every one of our certificates. I thought that was just the greatest thing and I still have them in some scrapbook somewhere. We need to be doing that again and one of the real examples of physical fitness, of course, is John Glenn. John Glenn has been extraordinary all of his life. Senator John Glenn: You'll note that I sent here next to Florine hoping that a little of this impact would rub off on me. Senator Hillary Clinton: I'm just thrilled that we are talking about prevention because it is so important. I want to turn now to Marilou Martinez Stevens. She is from Texas. She is Chairman of the New America Alliance which is an organization of Latino business leaders who are devoted to the economic advancement of the Latino community and she does a lot of work developing small businesses and supporting small businesses. Small business is really under pressure when it comes to health care. So Marilou, can you tell us how health care issues are affected the small businesses that you work with in Texas? Marilou Martinez Stevens: First, thank you very much for bringing small business to the table because I think a lot of people are leaving small business out of the discussion. As you know, small businesses employ more people than larger corporations and yet we are not often at the table of discussion. Small business are, as you also know, overburdened in a lot of areas and what we are looking for, what I was so excited to hear about, is that you are looking for ways to partner with small business on how to help them become less burdened and help them hire more people and grow. Because as most of us know that the economy functions really on the back of small business. If small business is growing healthy, the economy of the United States is healthy and growing. One of the challenges, and I see a lot with small businesses as we are planning; health care is a huge, huge burden. Small businesses want to help and to create health services for their employees. We do. The issue is, and the reason is, because most of us work with the same people over and over either related or over many years so they are like family to us. It is heartbreaking when we see that certain people like our employees cannot get that care. I'll tell you a terrible story about one of my clients that had a young lady that was having trouble at work and my client came and said this employee is wonderful, she's always been the backbone of my company. She's being kind of back, pulling back. And I knew her very well and I asked her and she had a very sick child and she was telling me that her medication was going to cost $1,800, two treatments a week so that she could breath. She had some kind of pulmonary problem and I said oh my goodness, how can it get that expensive? And she said, ""We missed one appointment, because it would've cost $600 but now I don't know what I am going to do."" Every time I think about it I get choked up because I'm a mom and I know most of you are parents and how do you deal with that? I mean, you can't concentrate on work, you can't do what you want to do because you've got this responsibility to your family and I've started now several years back working with small business to find different solutions on how to provide the needed health care for their area. Now, there are a lot of things in the tax code that does allow for some type of reimbursement with small businesses but nothing covers catastrophic problems. For instance, a major accident â just driving, you run that risk. Long term disease, something that you didn't know was coming and those kinds of things you can't afford to even help out. In my case, the employer was able to figure out, I can help you with that and she thought, I didn't know you could do that. But when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, even the most caring employer can't help. We are so excited that you are looking for ways to partner up and look outside of the realm of how â especially the idea you talked about with colleges. Graduates are coming out and they have large debts and how can we create incentives for them to start a type of business. Most of you have heard of pre-paid legal. I'm thinking we need to look at pre-paid medical so that we can start with the less expensive. So if I have a cough, if my child has a cough I can do and I know that it's not going to be hundreds of dollars and I can get his medication and I don't have to wait until later on when it is pneumonia and you need more expensive equipment and more expensive medication that can't be afforded. So we're looking for ways to have real health care and not disease management, which is extremely expensive and small business can't afford it. So I am really, really excited that you are inviting us to the table and looking for solutions like that so that the small business can continue to be the backbone of the United States. Senator Hillary Clinton: You are absolutely right. Small business is the backbone and it has created the most jobs in America in the last twenty years and under my health care plan, small business would not be required to provide health care to employees but would be given benefits if they chose to help. The problem is if you are in a small business, insurance companies can really discriminate against you. I think it's unconstitutional for insurance companies to discriminate. I think they should not be permitted to do that. The best way to get the cost down is to get everybody in the system because if you are in a small business with ten, twenty people, it's impossible if somebody gets sick. There is no way you can continue to afford that group insurance. If you are in a system with millions of people then you are going to be able to afford it, so that's why we need for small business, also to be part of the universal health care system and we can make that happen with the right kind of tax credits and limits on payment and ending insurance company discrimination, which is one of the parts of my health care system because until we get control over insurance companies, we are not going to be able to get the costs down so they have to be part of the solution. Whether they are enthusiastic about that or not, it's time that we had doctors and nurses and health care professionals and business and labor and leaders at all levels of government working together to make these changes that the insurance companies will have to go along with. That's what we're going to do if we have a chance to implement it. Final topic is education and work force development. And Zanesville Mayor Butch Zwelling, the mayor of the Y-Bridge City, I know you are working hard to improve the skills and the training of workers here in your city and that you have had some success in bringing some new business even though you have lost some, it's been something you've worked really hard on. Could you talk about some of what you've learned about education workforce development? Mayor Butch Zwelling: Thank you so much and thank you for being in Zanesville, Ohio and bringing the outstanding people that you have brought, we appreciate and welcome all of you to Zanesville. We have felt the brunt of much of everything we have talked about here today. Incidentally, my friend Florine here set me straight. I said was the Senator saving the best for last? And she said, ""No, alphabetical order."" Anyway, we have lost some industry. As part of the housing crisis, we've lost all-American homes, 100 jobs in manufacturing. We have lost jobs from the Lear Corporation who relocated in Mexico. We have lost some jobs at the Longaberger Company. But we are not whining around about, we are doing something about it. We have an outstanding Port Authority and the County Commissioners and the City Hall work together although we're not all the same politics, we are on the same page, though. We have an outstanding director of the Port Authority and we have brought in in the past year the Bilco Company from Connecticut, the Aamco Company from Belgium and Avon is presently building a $120 million distribution center right here in Zanesville. I know we have a moratorium on compliments and I have a million I could give to you but I want to tell these people in Zanesville and our distinguished visitors that much of the credit for the businesses, the manufacturing that has come to Zanesville, Bilco, Aamco and Avon, was with the cooperation and help of Governor Ted Strickland and Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher. One of the things that I think that you are going to be very sensitive about is community development and block grant finding. We have been cut, cut, cut under the Bush administration. We've lost 27% of that funding since 2002 and I spoke before a Congressional sub committee a couple of years ago when President Bush was threatening to cut the whole program out as a way to balance his budget. President Bush doesn't understand that this is the tip of Appalachia, that there are people in this area that do not have water and sewers and he doesn't have a clue about that. I know that you do and we are so excited about your coming to the White House to do something about that because that involves infrastructure; waterlines, sewer lines. That involves jobs. We have to have that kind of money in order to operate as a community. We have a $52.6 million budget. Half of it goes to health care and payroll. There is no fat in our budget whatsoever. We are constantly doing something about it. We appreciate the help that we have in Columbus. We also have a great Congressman, Zack Space who helps us and is by our side fighting every battle with us. We have a great friend in Sherrod Brown and George Voinovich in the United States Senate and we've just got friends in the right places except one. We look forward to having that friend, you, in the White House. Thank you for coming today. Senator Hillary Clinton: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you. You will have a friend and a partner. That's something that I look forward to and I also appreciate your mentioning the community development block grants. The way that the federal government under President Bush and the Republican Congress has cut a lot of the aid that came to communities has put extra burdens on your tax payers and that is something that we will definitely address because it's very hard for you to manage a lot of the needs you have if you are just relying upon your own resources. Finally, Laura Meeks who is the President of Jefferson Community College. She is also the Chair of the Ohio Appalachian Center for Higher Education. Some of you may not know that Appalachia goes up into New York, so I have worked with the Appalachian Regional Council, I've worked with my colleagues, the senators from the states that are considered in Appalachia. There is a tier of counties in southern New York that have very similar problems to what we are talking about here in Ohio. Laura, you see people every single day in Ohio who are eager to get jobs, who are entrepreneurial, they are inventive, they have great ideas, they are going to work really hard. So what's the best way to make sure that these hardworking Ohioans have a chance? How do we best make them ready and train them so that we can have a real match between the jobs we can create and recruit and the workers right here in this area? Laura Meeks: Thank you Senator Clinton. Speaking on behalf of 1,200 community colleges in the nation, you are a friend of community colleges. We know that. As a matter of fact, you get it. You opened your comments by saying about higher education; we need to make sure it is accessible and affordable for all. The other day we had a snow day. It was one of those great things sometimes you get to have. I don't know if you have snow days in Zanesville but we had one at Jefferson in Steubenville the other day. I was by myself working and I heard someone and I looked up and there was a young woman, a young girl and her grandfather was with her. I thought it was her father. He explained to me that this young woman lost her father about a month ago and he said, ""This is my granddaughter, here is her application."" This girl came in the snow to make sure that we had this application and her grandfather said, ""I'm a retired steelworker, had a good living but my granddaughter needs to make sure she goes to college."" I took her application and I found her a CD catalogue and gave her a catalogue because that's what she wanted and I promised her I would get it in the next day when everyone was there. When I looked at her, she touched that catalog and it really became real to her. I look back on my life when I was twelve years old my father lost his business. He had a feed store, grinding feed for cattle and it burned. He became a truck driver and my mom washed dishes in a nursing home for twenty years. They made a good living but they taught me something important, and it's a lesson that all of us in higher education in Ohio understand. It's that you have to get an education to get a better job and everyday we know that. What makes it difficult for us is the high cost of tuition and in Ohio we do have a high cost. I am so honored to say that we have a governor, Governor Strickland, who froze tuition for the state of Ohio for two years and he did that at a great price. When we talk about keeping the cost of tuition low, we need to make sure that we keep that low. You're right on, you get it. The other thing I'd like to say is that, we have a lot of work ethic, we have people with strong work ethic; we have a will to work. We have a fiber of higher education that can train people to work, what we need are the jobs, and you know what? We have them. We have the opportunity where we live we have smoke stacks, steel industries. We also have energy companies. We have first energy and also cardinal. AEP and they're cleaning; they're using resource to put in clears. Those are some very good jobs. Youngstown State University and Jefferson Community College have a partnership, we've has 2 classes with 20 graduates; graduates in power technology who will go out and make at least $21 starting wages. We have really good jobs in the energy industry in Ohio. Engineering jobs and we have some hope of getting as coal liquefaction company that might come near us. I just want to say keep doing it, keep appreciating your higher education system in the United States. Thank you for understanding the power of a community college. We have the will and we want to go to bed every night waking up in the morning knowing that someone in the White House shares our vision and our dream. That everyday in higher education we're trying to make the lives of people better for families in America by giving them a better chance for a better job. Thank you. Senator Hillary Clinton: Oh great. That's so great. I just have to emphasize what you said about community colleges; they are so important for our economy. I was at Columbus State Community College a few days ago talking about the programs they have in order to train people for these new clean energy jobs and we can do this. We absolutely can do this. And I know, Gary, you've been working in some of the apprenticeship programs, Helmets to Hard Hats, a program that I've supported. So this needs to be joint effort; business, labor, government, education. All of us have to be on the same team, the American team. If we start once again playing on the American team, nobody can beat us. That's what I believe. I really appreciate everyone coming out today, because we want this to be an ongoing conversation. There are lots of good ideas that people have and we've been working to come up with what will make a difference. What might work in Ohio might not work in Texas, and so we've got to have a variety of approaches. The federal government needs to be a partner. Of course, that means we've got to listen and we've got to be available. It's what I believe we do best if we actually roll up our sleeves and get to work together. I've put out this ""Solutions for America"" economic blueprint; you can pick up copies on the way out. It's an abbreviated version, but it puts out some of the ideas that I believe could make a difference. At the end of the day we have to decide what kinds of future we want. It doesn't happen by accident. What Laura was saying, you just don't stay at home and say I think I'll dream my way to a higher education, you've got to put on your boots, you've got to walk through the snow, you've got to deliver the application, you've got to attend the classes, you've got to be qualified. That's true in life, and it's true in a country. So it's our chance now to seize the 21st century. I am absolutely convinced that our best days can be ahead for America. That all of the concerns we have, we can handle them. But we're going to have to be serious about how we do it. There's no doubt in my mind as I travel across Ohio that people in Ohio are ready. You have governor, a lieutenant governor, who I know are making a difference. We just need to stay with you. We can't get discouraged, we can't get into fads; try this and don't do it. Building the Erie Canal took, David, how many years? About eight, twelve years? Change does take consistent, concerted effort. But the real question for us is not whether change will happen; change is going to happen whether we want it or not. Change is a part of life. It's whether progress will happen. Whether we'll see the kind of progress here in Ohio and Texas and America that the people of our country deserve. So I'm very confident and optimistic about what we're going to do together. And I'm very grateful that we would have this opportunity with so many distinguished Ohioans and visitors from around our country to talk about what we're going to do to make Ohio as important and prosperous and successful to America's future as it was, Governor, to America's past. Thank you all very much.","['Ohio lost over one quarter of its manufacturing jobs, over 200,000 workers out of work since the year 2000', ""And I will also crack down on China's unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation which gives them big advantages over our companies and our country"", ""We're the home of GM and Chrysler and Ford and when I hear that there are no more GM plants in your state Governor, it really pains all of us"", ""I believe you can't have a strong economy unless you have a strong manufacturing sector"", 'New York has lost 189,000 manufacturing jobs going back to the same time period', ""And I'm an old washed up finance person but, I'll tell you, if you got in trouble in a corporate situation you'd go to your bank and you'd talk about having a moratorium on debt payments"", ""As part of the housing crisis, we've lost all-American homes, 100 jobs in manufacturing"", 'The price kept going down, what they were willing to pay for that wage', 'That, to me, is just so unfair', 'But in the last few years we came under attack in the world market and in particular in China and local companies in China manufacturing fiber sought to have our product either barred from entry to the Chinese market or levied with significant tariffs, upwards in the neighborhood of 46%', 'Too many of our workers have lost and are in danger of losing their jobs', ""And the second reason is there is no doubt in my mind, as Dave just said, we have lost jobs over the last 20 years and increasingly over the last seven years where we've lost, in Ohio alone, 200,000 jobs in manufacturing while George Bush has been president""]","[""And, I'll tell you, it saddened me because that shirt was not only made in America at one time by a company called Fruit of the Loom, but now was being made in Vietnam and was being sold in that Marine Corps recruit depot"", ""What are we going to do to provide more housing that's affordable?
